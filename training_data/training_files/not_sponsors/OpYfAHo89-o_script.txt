Squarespace [Music] I recently put out a video talking about how I edit color in my images and using curves and HSL sliders how I dial in the correct color mix that I want to see and some of you've asked a question how do you do the same sort of thing but for your video work and some of you also commented and said that the videos that I produce have a particular kind of look to them so today I'm spend a little bit of time talking to you about how I color grade my videos I don't usually spend a lot of time on video on this channel I've just been talking about photography really but there's absolutely no reason why I'm not happy to spend time talking about video as well so if that's something you're keen on and you'd like me to spend more time on leave some comments below let me know or send me a message on some of my other social channels and give me specific questions you'd like me to spend time on and I'd be happy to do that now I'm not a professional colorist by any stretch but I'll show you some of the simple techniques I used when I'm grading my footage some things you should know is I always shoot on a flat picture profile on my on my cameras I use Canon DSLRs for most of my video work although a mixing GoPro footage and drones every now and again I'm trying to get the flattest profile I can I use a Technicolor cine star when I film or some of the I've got some of the logs that James Miller's put out which sort of imitate Canon C log for your DSLRs and all that does this gives me a little bit more cheated dynamic range in terms of the footage that I'm using for most the videos you see on this channel I use Final Cut Pro X on my iMac I find it a very speedy editing program but the color board which used to color great is terrible I'm going to show you how to use that I've also got some extra plugins which help with color grading and I'll show you some of those as well I also use Premiere Pro a lot which I find the color grading in Premiere Pro with lumetri color is a lot easier to use it's a lot more intuitive and I really enjoy that but if you want a free option that is amazing take a look at DaVinci Resolve it's a free download and you get 99% of the program there's some extra little things you get like noise reduction if you want the pro version but the free version gives you most of the editing program and the color grading tools in that our industry standard they really are brilliant I'm gonna take you through three basic steps for color grading the first one is going to be your primary grade which is just the whole image where you dial in the correct amount of our brightness and contrast and you make sure your colors are correct the secondary grade is going to be where you might play or tweak with particular colors in the image and maybe you want to highlight a particular area of the image with a window or I'll show you how to do that and then the last step is going to be to create the look for your image which is going to be like your mastering I'll also show you how to create your own light in Photoshop let just stands for lookup table and that's going to be a collection of data it's just a small file that you're going to apply over your whole image which is going to bring all your shots together into one piece and it's gonna give all your footage and your whole video a look and that's going to be your mastering stage so let's jump right in okay so I'm inside Final Cut Pro 10 and I've just imported onto a timeline six shots from the last video that I put out there and these are all just raw straight at a camera nothing done to them yet they're just as shot so you can see looking at the footage how kind of gray and washed out it is not a lot of contrast not a lot of color and what that's doing is its protecting my highlights and also having me keep my shadow detail just remember that when you're shooting with flat picture profiles on DSLRs especially the Canon DSLRs it's definitely a good way to keep that dynamic range but you now have to be careful in this stage because you're not working with RAW files or or great video codecs that you can pull a long way and the image will hold up if you pull them too far they will start to break apart and band so you do need to be careful that when you're going through so just one at a time I'm gonna move fairly quickly so this videos and too long and I'm gonna show you my process for grading footage so you can see these six shots here basically what I want to do is my effects panel on the right which you just click this little icon here it pops everything out and I'm going to show you using the the built-in color board color corrector so I'm just taking color correction dragging it straight on top of the clip and this is the built-in color correction tool Final Cut Pro X has personally as I said I'm not a massive fan but I want to show you how to do this if you have Final Cut Pro 10 you don't have any plugins it is still possible and what I'm gonna do on each of these shots so far just to get started is that primary color grade we spoke about so I'm looking at the overall image and I want to dial in the right amount of contrast that I want to see and make sure the color is broadly speaking correct that's my first stage on each of these clips so you can imagine the mo what I normally been looking at is a complicated kind of timeline here all my video built out I do all the building first these are just six clips in a row but normally it would be audio files underneath here and extra video files and text files on top once I've built out my structure this is this is the stage where I'll get to the correction the color correction so first thing I want to do is go up here to window workspaces and I want to go to color and effects and what that's gonna do is it's gonna bring up my scopes now I generally change my view to just side by side on the left I usually put my waveform and on the right I put my vector scope and I'll show you why in a minute and usually I'll just create a little more space for my my waveform my RGB parade than I do for my vector scope and I'll show you what this is for a minute so what this is showing you is in your your red your green and your blue channels this is showing you how much luminance you have in each okay so zero here is black anything under zero means you have totally lost the detail that has just gone to pure black anything that sits on zero and similarly anything that goes above 100 is blown totally to white which means you've lost all the detail in that within the image here the way this works is from left to right on each of these channels is left to right on this picture so you can see there's more luminance on on the left-hand side here because there's more limits on the left of the picture if I scrub through you can see how it moves on the waveform you can see what I'm talking about from left to right simply it jumps across here you can see this is the cross right here on this just on the on the near left hand side there so as I scrub through you can see if we move to shot me talking here you can see me moving around in that part that you can see this is my head on each of those so from left to right that's how you read those scopes and obviously if there's a lot more looks like there's a lot more red in the image but that makes perfect sense because obviously it's a warm sunrise so what you're looking at is good if it's a good way to check sometimes if you've got a color cast in your image if one of these are boosted like if there's a lot of green in here and not much red and blue it means you've got a green color cast you image you can see this one's fairly well balanced this one's quite orangey red but it should be because it's a sunrise that one's fairly well balanced fairly well balanced so and the rest makes sense so this is just a way for you to see kind of do you have any color cast new image and making sure it makes sense so with this first clip selected now I'm just going to click on this little arrow icon next to color board and this will open up my color board and the way this works in three panels the first panel is your exposure your second panel here is your saturation and your third is your color okay so the way that the way that I normally work is I'll start with my exposure and get that correct I only generally use two sliders and the first is my global slider this changes the exposure of the entire image and my mid slider so this just affects the exposure of the mid-tones okay so I might tweak my highlights and shadows but generally if I can get away without using those it's better because the image stands less chance of breaking apart so taking my global slider and watching why my RGB parade on this side I want to push my global exposure so that it's coming right near the top there but I don't want to touch 100 often I'm aiming for around 95 in my head and then I'm taking my mid-tone slider and dragging that down and this will create contrast but I don't want again I don't want this touching anywhere near zero okay now that's looking fairly good now I might want to take the shadows and just pull them down a little bit just to create that little extra bit of crunch and then just my highlights just a little touch up there so now that's looking fairly good to me so if I come back here and I turn this on and off you can see the contrast I've just added back some contrast quite subtle not too heavy okay now in my saturation generally what I want to do is I want to desaturate my highlights lightly I usually just automatically put in minus 5 and minus 5 on my shadows in cinema when you look at images what they've often done in their color graders they've desaturated highlights and shadows and just kept the mid-tones quite rich and vibrant so that's a little trick I like to do I'll often push back in a slight bit of global saturation just because I know that the picture profiles I use do tend to pull out some of that color detail but you need to be quite careful with that on this image it doesn't need too much obviously because it is quite a rich sky now my color palette here similarly you've got your global which is going to affect the whole the whole look globally so that's just pushing green into my global image set that back to zero and then you've got your your shadows and your mid-tones and your highlights so what you can do here and I generally don't do this because I find this a little bit clunky and you have to make very tiny moves to make this make sense but say I want to push in some oranges into the highlights so if I pull this over here and just drag slightly up into the highlights let's make this 5 so you can see anything above the line means I'm adding the color on this spectrum so I'm here in the orange is pushing it slightly above the line and anything I want to take out I'm going to drag below the line so if I pull down on my mids here I'm taking out cyan which is having the effect of adding orange and so let's take that back to 0 again if I want to take my shadows now potentially what I might want to do just the opposite out and give you your teal on orange look is bring it over to my teals and push some push some sort of teals into those shadows okay now this is OK generally I don't really want to do too much of this at this stage and the reason for that is that the primary grade should just be about for me correcting my contrast and exposure and just making sure the colors are correct I don't want to stylize at the moment and with that in mind I must set these back to zero what we're going to do is we're going to introduce our color look with our lots later okay now let's move quite far so this one's looking fairly good moving stray - my next image make sure it's selected we're here in the color panel it's got exposure same thing again I'm watching my scopes on the left here so I'm going to push my global exposure up I don't want it to touch 100 or come to place taking my mid-tones and dragging those down to create the contrast that I want in that image and that's looking fairly good I don't mind that it's quite dark and moody you know I want this silhouetted the cross and the little church and I want this sky to look really good so I might bring my my highlights down a touch because I could see this is quite close to blowing out and then I'm like just drop the shadows a touch to create a bit more contrast I'm gonna go into my saturation I'm going to boost up my saturation quite a bit on this one because it is looking quite washed out so maybe let's go - that's good a 20 and see what that does it's a little much so I'm gonna dial that back to 16 17 shadows again I'm gonna go to -5 and highlights I'm gonna go - 5 so it's going to keep my mid-tones saturated and just desaturate my highlights and shadows ok again I'm not going to touch the color board we're gonna come to that later so you can see that's looking so I'm scrubbing backwards and forwards between Clips the whole time to make sure that I'm dialing in similar amounts of contrast and saturation let's go again exposure watching my parade on the left here I'm gonna push my global yep that's looking pretty good don't touch 100 stay below and take my mid-tones and drag them down okay now this one I can already tell is going to be muddy unless I take my my shadows down as well so I'm going to pull my shadow slightly it's gonna be quite a tricky one it's gonna be quite a fine line and because there's so much here this so much dark shadow in the bottom here and there's so much so bright highlights on these clouds it means it is going to be quite a moody image which I'm fine with I'm gonna push my pillow well back up again just to create a little bit more contrast and then my mids down a bit okay and that's looking fairly good saturation on it boost this back up - yeah let's try 18 and then shadows I'm going to leave them on this one because it's still looking quite d saturated globe I'm gonna push that even more and that's looking fairly good on this one I'm gonna go into color and I'm just gonna warm up my mid-tones a little bit just to match with what I've been doing what the other ones look like already so probably just two let's just try to they're just into those those warmth sort of warm oranges that's looking fairly good I'm scrubbing backwards and forwards those are looking fairly similar if I turn this on and off you can see what I've done on this it's acquired a big difference and this is just your primary remember this is your primary grade and this one here you can see quite a big difference okay so let's move on and I've just pulled in a clip of me talking here and the reason for this is this is where your vectorscope comes into play so your vectorscope works that you've got your Reds magentas blues scions greens and yellows that's your your color circle and this line that appears on here is your skin tone line so a great way to check if your skin tones are looking good and they're looking natural is to make sure that your color sits on that skin tone line and if you want to do this properly I found the best way to do it is to take your scale and your transform panel here and to dial it right in like this so push it right let's take it to 600 okay and then on my X&Y I'm just gonna line myself up so that I am there's lots of skin tone in the frame okay so I filled the screen with mostly skin tone now I know that anything on this line here is going to be my skin tone line and I can already see that my skin tones are in the correct place so say if I drag my colour correction on top here if I have a color cast or something weird about the the image when I was recording if my white balance was incorrect and it was slightly too blue you can see what would happen with this line it would be all over the place and that's where I need to come into my color and I need to get my color correct before I want to start pushing my colors all over the place so I can set this back to 0 because I was in the right place again where you want to be as your mid-tones this this this will be where your skins live so you can see I could have it all over the place but it needs to be that I'm tweaking around and tell my skin tone lies from the center directly on this line and then I've got a good healthy skin tone okay so if I jump back out if I set this to 100 again and set this to zero and this to zero back where I should be and now my color board the same process again watching my RGB parade I'm pushing my highlight or my global exposure up watching these little these little pieces here I don't really want them touching 100 and then I'm going to take my mid-tones and drag those down to add my contrast back in maybe a little touch with the shadows to pull down and a little touch with the highlights I don't really want to do that because it's time to touch 100 so again let's just bring this down a touch great so if I turn this on and off I can see I've made a big difference there come back to my color board again I might want to push just a touch of color in so just 5 on this one minus 5 on my shadows and this is just a rule I use just because I know it gives it a slightly cinematic feel - five of my highlights and that's looking fairly good if I want to check again that nothing I've done here is affected their skin tones again same process I can just zoom right in and dial it over until my face fills the screen and make sure that it's lying on this skin tone line but I know from working on this already that that's pretty good so let's have a look just scrubbing backwards and forwards yep I think I can darling even more in the blacks and the shadows and this because looking at the other ones that have more contrast so making sure my exposures selected I can pull down the blacks on this as well and then it's gonna match slightly better that's pull up those that global exposure a little bit and they and the mid-tones down to create a bit more contrast so cycling backwards and forwards it's obviously different light when I started recording that but it's fine the contrast to me looks pretty similar okay let's do this wine quickly with this grass you can see it's nice and gray I've kept a lot of that detail just by using that flat picture profile exposure I'm gonna start pushing up until it's close to 100 got a little too far there close to 100 my RGB and then taking my mid-tones and pulling them way down so there may be my shadows a little touch and push my highlights a little bit okay and this one I want to saturate pushing some saturation yeah I can go 17 on this one and again this is up to preference so it's happy you want to dial it in I'm not gonna mess with color here I think it looks pretty good so I'm dialing backwards a forwards and looking around have I got things looking similar yes yes yes yes okay I think it looks pretty good and coming across to my last image again I want to check my RGB prayer got a lot of space on this one but I do need to be careful with this I'm gonna push my exposure on global to sort of the middle here and then I'm gonna start to bring my mid-tones down this will take a few moves to get the contrast baked in correctly push again on my global and then push again pull it down on my on my mid-tones okay that's looking fairly good this is already introducing more saturation because of how much contrast I'm pushing it a little touch on the highlights not too much and I think I'm gonna just a little bit on the shadows as well so that you can see I don't want any more saturation in this and I will pull down my shadows and my highlights again the interesting thing about pulling in contrast is it does create more saturation in your image visually as well so you have to sort of balance it out with everything else again if I turn this on and off you can see how much it's brought back okay so quick scan through on my primary grade and I feel like these are looking fairly similar now so early-morning brightening up riding up a little more quite a lot brighter on the beach and some grass and that's looking fairly good so that's it for my primary grade when it comes to the secondary grade this isn't necessarily something I do with every clip but especially interviews it's definitely a good idea and what I'm doing here is I'm is I'm color correcting and changing exposure on areas of the image rather than the image as a whole so if I drag color correction on top of this clip again it creates a second color correction and I'm gonna click on this little mask icon here and what that's gonna do is it's gonna add a shape mask over the image and if I drag this out over my face here and this outer circle determines how much it's feathered from the center circle to outside so I want quite a nice feather let's pull it out a little bit more and then when I hit inside my color board I've got these options at the bottom for mask inside and outside and what I want to do is I want to have outside selected and I want to go to exposure and I want to pull the mid-tones down outside of where I have things selected and inside I might just want to push up my highlights just a touch and maybe the global gotta be careful that because that's a little misty just a touch and what that's gonna do if I go back outside click off so the mask is off yet if I just deselect this one you can see what I've done is I've just drawn your eye into my face here while I'm talking so it's it's just a correction that's created a slight window because I'm not moving around too much I can get away with just using this area I've just created a window and drawn your eye to the brighter part of the image where I'm speaking and just darkened down some of these areas let's do one more quickly so say I take this one similar kind of thing color correction on top here's my second board if I go to shape mask again if I drag let's say on this one I want to drag this across I'm gonna create a rectangle this little light colored blob here actually changes it so you could square the edges and I'm gonna dial it out of screen and I'm gonna feather this off and I'm gonna push this right up here what I could do I probably don't want to do this in this case but let's just see what happens if I come across to my color board now let's select inside the mask which is just dealing with this area here if I want to push my exposure slightly it's gonna make it a little misty so let's change that back to zero let's just push my highlights a little bit so it's gonna push in my highlights and what I could do is outside which would be down the bottom here in the sky at the top what I could do is just pull my mid-tones down slightly you can see that's just creating a slight vignette just into into my area of focus and then one more quickly what we can do is say we've got this first clip here a lot of beautiful oranges and Pink's in the sky but let's say for example that they are looking a little too fierce for me for some reason so if we come back outside here because I've dragged it across here's my second color correct if I hit on this mask icon now I can say add a color mask and this gives me a little eyedropper and with this I can click and drag and select areas who say I want to just deal with these Pink's here I've just selected those Pink's and you can see the color it's selected in the little box here if I come across I can say for the pink specifically maybe I want to bring down those mid-tones just a touch and maybe I want to push the saturation into those mid-tones just a little bit to sort of bring some of the Pink's out as well and you can see what's happened here just very subtle it's just dark and that down and moody dude down so it matches with those oranges just a subtle and it'll move like that and with that what I've done is I've made sure that all my Clips now have a primary and a secondary grade on them and obviously I could go into a lot more detail and normally would spend more time in this but this just gives you an idea of how I'm sort of balancing the contrast and the saturation and the luminance of all these clips and then I'm dialing in areas I want you to focus on or fix in different areas of exposure within that clip with my with my secondary grade okay so now I'm going to show you how to create your own Lutz and to do that we're going to just put the playhead over the first clip go file share and save current frame and what this is gonna do is just save out just a still frame it's still shot just as a JPEG let me take my settings yep jpg image just the first frame is gonna save as a JPEG so I'm just going to put this on my desktop I'm gonna move my playhead to the second one I'm gonna go share save current frame I'm gonna make this frame too and when I'm doing this with a whole project I'm obviously not saving out every single frame from every single clip but what I do want to do is get a spread of different frames and a different lighting conditions and different looks and you'll see why in a minute so it's make this frame three so I'm just gonna continue to save these out and I will see you in a minute in Photoshop okay so we're here in Photoshop I've just created a canvas and I've dragged on my six clips from my film that I'm working on and if I've got a timeline of you know 20 minutes plus and a hundred shots I'm still only gonna choose five or six just to give me an overview and to see what the luck that I'm gonna create is gonna do to the shots over the whole piece the great thing about Photoshop is if you come down to your adjustment layers here most of the things in your adjustment layer here if you apply it to these images without any masks or anything that's specific to the image but just as a global adjustment you can translate and export that as a lot which you can then easily apply in Final Cut and most other video editing programs so let's go ahead and just create let's start with a curves layer on top here and just let's create a basic contrast curve and I'm watching very closely I'm watching my highlights and I'm watching my shadows across all these Clips so a little bit more contrast and say I want to just fade out my shadows a little bit I'm gonna drag my bottom piece here and just pull up just a little bit just to add a touch of fade and then maybe pull my shadows down a little bit there and maybe I want to fade out my highlights just a touch as well so I'm gonna pull my and pull my my white point down just a little bit okay that should just turn that on and off just to see what that's done I like what that's doing okay let's go into my hue and saturation sliders and again you've seen me do this on stuff like darkroom I use the same kind of principles for everything I want to take out some of my Saiyans and blue so I'm gonna desaturate some of these blues and science a little bit and let's do the same I just want to darkened down my blues as well and let's come back to my oranges and my yel reds and yellows and photoshop here so my Reds be very very careful because you're always very I'm already very saturated on this one already so I'm just gonna boost this just a little bit it's that's even too much so let's just say two and I'm watching my skin tones as well there might be a little too much just one and let's see what it happens if I brighten these up a little bit as well let's just take this too too as well okay it's just a little touch on my hue/saturation let's go to my color balance on this one I like to just pull in opposite colors into highlights and shadows just to create a little color contrast but that doesn't kill any detail so this is my little formula I often use just -3 cyan this is my shadow selected and +3 on blue and that's just gonna pull in some cooler tones into my shadows if I come up to my highlights into the opposite and go -3 on yellow and +3 on on red and then my mid-tones and might just want to push in the minus 300 euros and let's just have a look if I turn that layer on and off you can see it just created some nice color contrast but it hasn't lost any of the detail on top of that I think I want another curves layer because I'm starting to pull the contrast in quite heavily so I want to just pull down without creating a curve I just want to pull down my my highlights a little bit and push up my shadows just a touch I will create a node here and just set these back I think just a little bit just onto that line and that's looking quite nice and filmic so again if I turn off these adjustments that I've just put on now you can see that's what I came in with and just creating a little bit of a look that's what I'm already creating as a slightly more filmic look let's see what else might I want to do let's add a photo filter and this is going to be global so I don't I think this is sort of too warm and orange let's just make sure my color is selected so I probably on a desaturate this a little bit but I do like the idea of just warming up the whole image slightly so I just want to pull in maybe something is slightly less actually or something more almost just golden but somewhere in the middle let's see what that does if I turn this on and off yeah I quite like that so there's just applying a global kind of palette over the top I might just pull this to sort of 50% let's have a look okay so again if I take all these off that's what I came in with and I'm quite liking how that looks and so it brings everything together there's looking pretty good I'm just gonna add a levels layer on top and a great trick with levels is if I hold down alt and I click on my highlight end of my my levels again levels is your your shadows mid-tones highlights if I pull my my highlights to the right this is gonna mean my white point is gonna clip closer which means I'm losing all the information passed this to white so I'm effectively creating contrast again with the with the blacks if I pull it up everything past here all this information here on this image has gone to black but what I can do is if I can hold alt and I can drag it my screen turns black but as I drag across with my slider here on the right hand side you can see the areas that you're losing to white so again I can slide it until I'm almost starting to lose some information so 250 looks pretty good again with the black so I can do the same I'm starting to lose it there let's come back up but we don't want to do this too much it's too much contrast so let's just put this at like let's try 4 here yeah it's gonna dial back in some contrast levels great one more thing I might want to do here is just go to hue/saturation and I might just want to take my saturation just down 5 just to kind of soften everything make sure everything's not too vibrance if I turn everything off again turn it all back on that to me is looking good kind of brings the images together nicely okay last thing you want to do before you export is just select everything that isn't an adjustment layer so select your top layer go down to your bottom layer hold shift and just click everything and then I want to go right click and then merge layers so now everything above this is what it's going to export as your LUT so I'm going to come up to file export come down here to color lookup tables and I want to call this Lindisfarne and yeah 30 to medium is absolutely fine 3 DL and cube cube is probably the one that fcpx is going to want to use and I'm going to go to desktop here and I'm going to go to Lindisfarne Lindisfarne LUT it's called oh one and then save okay back in Final Cut Pro X I want to go to window workspace is and I want to go to default and then back in default I want to click on my little icon here which is for titles and generators and this is an adjustment layer which is it's a free plugin I got from color grading central you can drag this on top of your clips and the nice thing is you can drag it over your clips and any anything you any correction you make to this layer will apply to anything underneath it so it's a nice way to kind of make global Corrections it's open my effects tab on the right here and I'm gonna come down to unfortunately Final Cut Pro X doesn't have a lot loader built into the program natively but you can go to pixel film studios and they have a free fcpx a lot loader which you can download again for free so I'm going to drag this on to my adjustment layer and then I'm gonna go to choose external let I'm gonna go to my Lindisfarne oh one light which I exported and there you can see if I turn this on and off its applied my LUT and it's applied across all these clips I can turn it on and off you and I can see what that lets doing it's giving it quite a sort of filmic warm look and if I say at this stage I like it but maybe it's too strong very very easy in this and any luck later we'll have similar you can dial in how much of that light you want to see into the image so on this one probably I would put its sixty-five somewhere and this is just like another opacity sort of slide of it because I've done this mastering layer on top it's a way that again bring all these clips together under an umbrella that sort of makes them feel like one piece the other little things I probably do is again at this stage in this adjustment layer I probably add some sharpening any kind of sharpening I wanted to see I might add just a touch of a of a vignette but again that vignette must be totally invisible you must never see it or you've messed up just to sort of pull some Center focus in little things like that but otherwise I think that's looking pretty good purchase [Music] [Applause] [Music]
