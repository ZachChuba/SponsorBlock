back once again my hardcore iron man only playable in pvp worlds the current bounty for pk in this account is 250 mil i start this video with humble stats but trust me we make some big moves so i decided to train my magic up in the catacombs of karen's now fire giants are a pretty common monster but i doubt anyone would expect me to kill them right next to steel dragons that can one shot me if i stand one step to the west hopefully i get a rune simi of this 40 magic i can now teleport to my house and now i've balanced out my stats so if i get any more melee stats range or mage i increase your combat level this maximizes my hp for my combat level 47 mage i said i'd even get 47 or rune simi before i left and we've reached the level sadly got a full inventory of random stuff here the heads are going to be good for prayer and i've been burying the big bones as well but unless there's one on here we leave roon simulus getting 47 mage was important because now i can make my ruby amulets use a wizard mind bomb to boost up to 49 and enchant it ami of strength done [Music] hello welcome to england it's much more than bangers and mash we got geezers out on the lash no dragon bones needed i'm using the insole heads for my prayer but it yeah it's pretty scary i literally don't know where i would go if i got t beat here there's not really any escapes by going to the rcs spell book and yeah let's get some prayer xp also this new school means i'm in the super high risk world risking all my items that means nothing to me really but i just thought you should know a giant head gives me 650 xp that's like two d-bones hello there mr red dehydra to be fair even if i get deburred these days 47 hp i'm laughing just making the last of my serums here to get me 30 hair blood this is the level i need to use the once more favor lamps that we unlocked last video once more favor is done i didn't want to complete the quest until i could actually use the lamps on useful skills so there we go two 10k xp lamps and i think i'm gonna use these on prayer and herbal the first one is going on prayer i've run out of insult heads and i really want to get overhead so that gives me 40 range which will be useful for my survivability of tb'd and the second one it's got to be herbal 35 down we're nearly at prayer potions already herb is just so hard to train on this sort of account 41 combat now we're moving up there i messed up i had my thing paused the whole time but i just got 43 prayer doing uh some more insult heads at the altar did some more chaos stewards for that and back some more herbs yeah so now we have all three protection prayers which is really nice dabbling in a bit of hair blur here for 37 meaning we're not quite at the level but it doesn't matter grieman's ale up and now i can actually make myself some prayer potions with my runners got a few of these in the bank so this is gonna be very useful if i get t bead and i'm getting smarted don't have to worry about my prayer now very happy also you can use these for pvm there he is he's there he's like he's done can i get him have you relax if you're like so bad so instead of relying on that weedy armed deboer i made my own account 60 range 10 hp and 32 combat and the sole purpose of this account is to kill hardcore iron man [Music] [Music] yeah maybe my arms are a little bit weak too unless [Music] no way i got the original guy [Music] is this her scout my pvp hardcore iron man is coming along really well right now so i figure it's about time i set an early iron man goal zora not exactly essential but because the engineer was the inspiration for the series i figure it's about time i avenge him [Music] wait was there supposed to be a trap there figured now i have protection prayers i would come and do underground pass 43 prayer makes everything so easy these spiders jump on you after this and it's going to come in handy the nice little added bonus here of the underground pass quest is we can kill the disciples of ivan for zami rose which are actually my best mage ropes and offer some prayer bonus at my one defense luckily no one was waiting for me in the past it would be pretty annoying to uh go and check for me there wouldn't it so that's the quest completed we now get three thousand attack xp and i will move straight on to 200 grand for a staff viabin definitely worth the investment though you think of an iron man you think of mage and you think of ivan's blast you think of ivan staff i can't wear it yet though i need 50 mage all right there is no way anybody is going to be checking for me in this absolute nightmare of a location the elven lands doing the regicide quest now to go to zora i feel pretty safe right now not gonna lie also if someone gets on me i can just go down a leaf trap and i'm pretty sure this is a one by one if you approach it from the same side yeah if we've got a tyrus helm made you an absolute tank every time i get one of these cut scenes it's just oh my god everyone scales out rd all the time like can i can i teleport here or not and there we have it regicide quest completed that is all the questing i have to do for a little bit not already thank you okay the plan is to train up to 50 magic so i can use ivan's blast on these hill giants here they also drop in sold heads so that's good for my prayer gains and all that jazz if you're not sure where we are in the tavley dungeon right now and i'm pretty sure these are all aggressive there we go 50 magic where hey also got 50 range 50 hp 50 attack my stats are looking clean we're balanced once again and now i can use my ivan staff and we've actually got a few installed heads from this as well it's time to say goodbye to my first cat truth be told i'm not really a fan of selling cats like i don't really want to have to run through rd which is quite a dangerous area bet you never seen a youtuber do this before currently forging a ring of forging what am i even going to do to trade my smithing on this account without blast furnace i'm actually lost in this world it's not even a safe zone there either i can't even buy alls really i am definitely not using the varocanville because that is the pk hotspot of the century so we're going to be making some iron knives here in port kazad and it's pretty close to the bank which is a safe zone okay so here is my gear to attempt taking on zulra yeah you might laugh at me but we're 42 combat ivan's blast and iron knives and the power of t is it uh too late to be having second thoughts right now yeah we're gonna get a 1kc blowpipe on the way to doing zorro i saw this guy finishing scales on a pvp world i don't know why [ __ ] mention my name but devilman's trying to get attention again told you before this year is the year with the real fake [ __ ] getting left in the rain think cause i'm not there sitting on the plane that i can't really hear what the people are saying but i can hear everything loud and clear 4 000 what this guy must have been here ages have you got dragon harpoon as well how much is that is that like a male or something 1.4 million [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] inject that tanzanite fang into my [ __ ] veins [ __ ] 42 combat hardcore man zora kill imagine dying to this thing in 2020 i'm i'm joking please don't kill me 11 minute kill now there's peak efficiency right here i don't think anyone would have guessed that i was coming to zora so you know what don't have to worry about players if we do stupid [ __ ] like this also four zoro teles is a really good drop that's basically four safe kills in the future whenever i feel like it i don't think i want to go back to zoro until i can get there via the fairy ring also with my stats right now pretty damn inefficient with 50 range and mage i'd like to use both styles of my boss hold on i'm telling you the plan why would i want to go and do a thing like that [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh
