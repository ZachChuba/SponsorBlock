and will it see this line or is it gonna sit behind the Jeep guys look at this look at this this is incredible and I've lost control oh wow that is brilliant that is brilliance welcome back everybody to tears a driver I hope you're doing very well today we are literally looking at two things a brand new update has just come out 2020 28.5 so we skipped three and dot four but sadly as you can see in the release notes there is if they want to open absolutely nothing new except for some language support surely we've got all the languages by now no I'm not sure but apparently not so what we're really gonna be looking at today is the other auto pilot safety features in the model three that a lot of people don't know about now if you actually scroll down to the bottom you're gonna get these settings here which you can turn all off or you can have them on just warnings let's go through them all really quickly and we're gonna go and demonstrate them all today as well lane departure avoidance you can have off warning where we'll just chime or assist and when it's on assist if you drift out of your lane without indicating the car will bring you back in and say hey put your hands on the wheel or take control please you're clearly not concentrating and it will pull you back into its Lane that works really well and I'll show you that later emergency lane departure avoidance is pretty much the same thing blind spot collision warning chime basically if someone's in your blind spot and you're going to either indicate and go into the lane to your right if you're on a dual carriageway if there's someone there and you haven't spotted it but the car has it will tell you it will warn you and it'll bring you back in we'll try and get that happening today as well and of course automatic emergency braking we showed that in the Jeremy Clarkson video if you haven't seen that this is basically what it is here we go a true test then 30 mile an hour test let's do it hopefully I'll follow the cones down following the cows nicely coming close to him there he is red as you can see and the car comes again to a complete stop and it worked really well we also tried it again some blow-up dolls I'm gonna be able to drive at this kid I'm gonna pretend I'm not looking at this point and we're gonna drive at her at 50 miles an hour and will the car stop or not I've got my foot on the accelerator will the car stop incredible this is going to be a hell of a stop if it thinks it's a person oh it did or which did it work quite as well we're not quite sure why an obstacle aware acceleration we're basically if you're a t-junction and a car just goes by you and you accelerate a bit too early if you were going to potentially clip the side of the car or hit anything the car stops in and basically stops your accelerating like hey you sure and then it lets you continue if you push through it and we'll try and get that working today as well we're also going to be checking to see if they've updated any of the speed stuff recently we went through a fifty gate that is fairly new that it still said was a sixty and I actually had a viewer say that they've changed it on the map to a 50 so we're gonna go back there right now and we're gonna see has it updated it has it changed it or is it still the same now this is actually doing way better down here than it's ever done before it's it's never done this because it's always slammed on because of the cars on the left and I'm actually really impressed with how this is doing this road it's going a little bit too far to the right to me and you can see there it's breaking pulling itself back over it did show the cyclist there as well and will it see this line or is it gonna sit behind the Jeep guys look at this look at this this is incredible okay this is actually incredible it has never done this before oh it's getting too close to the left for me yeah too close to the left there but that was pretty impressive actually again automatic emergency braking if you're coming up to a car like that it's gonna warn you that you're going way too fast to it it's gonna highlight the car in red and then if you did continue to accelerate the car would have just braked itself slammed on and you would be safe you can see there is showing the person across the road that was actually really nicely done as well I'm not expecting anything big from this software update because I'll say it didn't say there was anything big except for new language support but so far I'm actually impressed it's a little bit more stable than it's been before let's see how it handles this roundabout here this bus will go all the way around yeah the bus is going all the way around and I can actually bring it down to zero on autopilot which is pretty cool ok oh no it just aborted right at the end there it sees that it's red lights it's not stopping for them at all so we will come to a stop and again Oh interesting actually fought the pole of the traffic light was a purse there oh we actually saw a stop sign back there that 30 interesting so that was a 30 side and he thought it was a stop sign so that again that you know that could be bad in the future when it actually does react to these things but at the moment it's not a big problem we're gonna bring autopilot all the way down to 10 miles an hour there's no one coming so now you can see that as soon as you get to a roundabout I knew this was coming as soon as you get to a roundabout no matter what if you're on autopilot it seems to abort at the moment which is a real shame but obviously makes sense because it can't do it but yeah it seems to be a lot stricter now and then previously around this corner it has has done it really well is it going to continue to do it really well look at that look at that really nice so it has obviously there's the auto steer limited so this is gonna be a really good test for when these regulations get a little bit eased because we're gonna be able to go back and see how does it react to these roads that we've tested before so let's test some of the safety features then so the idea of it is basically if you're to drift slightly on to the other lane it should pull you back in or at least that is the idea but as you can see I'm getting really close to the middle lane I'm not going over it so we're still on our lane and the cars not having any issues there you go look at that so as soon as my wheel touched the line I didn't go on the bobbles I just touched the line you saw it went blue and the car started to pull me back over okay there's no one coming ahead I'm letting go of the steering wheel and there we go look at that beautifully done and it's pulled me back into my lane here's the new fifty gate has it updated it to a 50 on here no sadly not sadly it's still saying it's a 60 I'm really surprised that that's not updated itself quicker okay will it break for that card yet you can see braking for the van as it went past which is good and through here no worries at all you can see it as well updating the line on where the traffic lights was that was good to see that update actively let's see what happens if we slightly drift to the left side of the road as if we're going into this lay by here and I've lost control oh wow that is brilliant that is brilliance absolutely fantastic corrective steering applied for your safety road departure at I don't know other than through the word said there I think is it detected that was incredible it pulled me right back on I wouldn't have crashed absolute result now what we're going to try and do is just on cruise control and I'm gonna drift across here on cruise control there you go pulling me back oh no interestingly enough it hasn't it started to but then it just kind of allowed me to go straight through which is a little bit strange oh we've got some cones in front of us it's the car gonna go around them oh it's so close it actually started to drift around them but I didn't have the balls to keep that going so I think it actually would have gone around those if I de let it I have also found that with them with cyclists it does do the acceleration thing a lot more and I think that's obviously because it doesn't want you to accelerate past a cyclist too close so as you go around them if you if you go too close it will kind of stop you from getting too close which is really good so like this fan is slightly on a stop on our road and you can see it actually thinks it's traffic lights there we go we got right up close to it last second that was actually so I had to put my foot on the accelerator because that was actually gonna slam on very very hard and brake as very very hard and basically come to a stop and that is the emergency braking so it does see it however that was a little bit late for my liking I rather it warned me a little bit earlier and came to us a gradual slow down however I think it was slightly confused and I think it was slightly hidden by the traffic lights again here is going to favor the right hand side being American and this is what I mean this is more of the breaking I expected it's kind of this nicer you can see here it's trying to find where the edge is or where the end of the traffic lights is and no problems for it there it has had issues here before because the roads so wide you can see yeah it's hugging the right-hand side of the road it's not too sure where it wants to go and now it's putting itself back over but that's not too bad we're on the dual carriageway now what we're gonna test is going over the lines I've just floored it passed everyone so there's no one behind us so we've got loads of space to test this out so hands slightly off the wheel just gonna try and drift across will the car allow us yes very strangely it just allowed me to drift straight across the middle lane without indicating which is actually a little bit odd I really wasn't expecting that let's test it around this corner so as we get to the corner I'm gonna steer slightly but I'm not gonna steer enough to stay in our lane again as you can clearly see there is no one around us so this is perfectly safe to do and my steering is just not quite as good as it should be yes there we go look at that perfect brought me back into the lane I'm now gonna oversteer and go left no sadly it didn't stop me they're going over from the left so it kind of works and then it kind of doesn't work actually as I said the inconsistency of the system again we're allowed to drift across here for some reason and it's happy for us to do it really inconsistent but I'm not sure again letting go the wheel just allows me to drift straight across even with cruise control on as well the car does pull me back into my lane correctly like that to be totally honest it doesn't do it as much as I would like to it needs to actually pull me in a little bit more there we go it's still yeah so there it just allowed me to drift a straight across and what I'm gonna do is as I get past this van I'm gonna indicate to the left and I'm gonna see if it warns me at all about it so here we go I'm indicating left it doesn't seem yeah there you go let gets warned me about it and it said hey there's a van there you probably shouldn't do that so it just it just shows you visually that there is something there let's see how it breaks behind this car very nicely no worries at all that was actually really well done what we're gonna test then on this is this is actually a perfect way to test to see if this left line here is strong enough or obvious enough for the car to pull us across so let's start just veering over to the left here and we're gonna see how does the car react I'm gonna keep on going keep on going I haven't touched for a long time boom there we go pulls us back in really really simple I'm not gonna touch it again and I'm gonna see will it do it again if I just kept on driving yeah look at that brilliant job and you actually heard that time it did touch it actually touch and you heard the boom of the verb of the line and yeah it warned me because it was like hey you didn't react the first time you haven't reacted the second time there's obviously something up and you heard it too a vision it did a visual and it did an audible warning which is really cool I actually really like it that it does both of those and that shows again that maybe if you had cruise control set and you started drifting even if you kept on going it would keep pulling you in and you know the cruise control is also going to stop you if you get too close to anyone in front so that's actually really really good to see look at this McDonald's disinfecting everything absolutely burning good job man the one I wasn't able to show very well is obstacle where acceleration but that is because do you have to put yourself in quite a lot of danger to actually get it to do that and I don't obviously want to do it but the others I think I showed you really well and these are kind of hidden secret autopilot safety features that a lot of people including Tesla drivers don't know about I've actually had to tell a couple of people to at least put it on to warning I would put on to assist personally let me know what you think down below about it in the comments section and also tomorrow I'm gonna be showing you a new autopilot video on a road I've never autopilot it down before and we're gonna see if 2020 28.5 is any different any better at all thank y'all so much for watching a huge get yourself a free mini supercharger in the post also I just want to apologize I haven't been able to keep up with a by daily uploads lots of personal things going on at the moment including movie house yes again so I do apologize about that and I will keep up to it as best I can until next time thank you so much for watching don't forget drive safe
