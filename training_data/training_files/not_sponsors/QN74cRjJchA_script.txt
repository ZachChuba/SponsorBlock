[Music] and what's going on guys welcome back if you're new to the channel welcome to super Tesla not welcome back so we're running software 20/20 doc 20.12 which gave us a new game called fallout shelter there has been a ton of update since I've done my last video as far as now we got the traffic light stop signs animation for people that walk about in front of the car now it's kids animated on the screen here and I'm about to have my car for almost a year now currently at sixteen thousand miles if I had any other car I don't think I would have for this many miles it's just that this car is just fun and I've taken extra road trips that not normally would it take so pretty fun as far as my battery I know a lot of people wonder about the battery my 9% charge I got the long range so when I would 90% charge on my long range when I was brand new I would get 279 miles right now I am getting at 260 as far as it affecting me daily it doesn't really matter because I'm only using about 45 to 50 miles a day I know it's a little small but you're able to see the lights here it's got two green and then the red one for that one on the left and if I Drive normally I can get about 240 between 245 250 watts per mile but sometimes I do like to accelerate a little fast in the car so I'll be around 270 so once I get on the freeway here we'll we'll get it on autopilot and just let it do its thing as far as that they did add a couple of things with the supercharged II now you can like select if you want like a level 1 or level 3 and the cool thing about it is that now it'll tell you if one of the stalls is like messed up so they'll be like 7 out of 8 available one not working so if you guys have any questions just leave them in the comments and I will try to my best to respond to all of them I don't get a lot of questions so I should be able to respond to them the model 3 did get a price drop of $2,000 so that's a very good thing happen recently another Model S in the Model X we've got a price drop of $5,000 and now you guys can order a model why and using my referral link and still get the 1,000 miles of free supercharging which is really helpful because I have yet to pay for any super charging and I still have like a thousand miles or something like that and I've only had two people use my referral link one was my friend someone that I don't know who it was but I want to thank you for using my referral link oh yeah one of the other major updates that they did that's been like one of my favorite is that now you can watch your century mode century mode and dashcam videos on the screen and I think that's amazing because when you see an incident or a century modak activity here on the screen you can just tap on it watch the video on make sure that nothing happened to your car or if something did happen you can watch it right there and write that in there and then if you have to call the police or something you can show them the video let's like one of the most useful updates they've done and still like a year into the car and I'm still getting like updates it just feels cool [Music] I usually stick to the right lane here and there'll be lanes that are like argent so the car will kind of moved to the right adjust itself see my average on the highway already jumped up to 285 and once I get back off it'll like drop Claire Anita's new Tesla Model 3 long range or now 322 when I got this one there were 310 I know the Model S is now estimated range is 402 which is incredible for a needy to have 200 400 miles there you go guess as I zoomed out too much it was like looking at this silver truck see how these reckless drivers driving like crazy out here as I left the house now to drop in attend to 74 earlier I did notice that there was a box into another screen maybe like 2 feet by 3 feet and on the screen here we're able to see it but it was showing as a trash can I guess they don't have any like representation of a box or like I think it would take them a long time just to do all kinds of like things that you would see on the corral like cheer because that rent into a chair once it's just a bunch of stuff that could be in the middle of the road the other day I did save the footage I saw this like tint flying across the street and there there was a guy chasing it so I did get to catch that oh yeah autopilots pretty smooth guys it's just really good especially on the highway so we're coming up to the area where these two laid your blades are going to merge and then a few feet up in front we're gonna get another late that's gonna merge I will speed up a little bit get in front of this vehicle this year I like doing stuff like that so it's a little easier a lot of so right here it's gonna merge on the lady can see it's quite a neat now we got two lanes and this is like the tricky part here but there's not a lot of vehicles right now another lane here on the right side that's going to merge with us and people man I have seen people just God like in between the lines jump over them so right here's my exit and I don't know what it is or my luck 95% of the time I'll get a red light here you can see all the arrows on the ground so yeah guys that's pretty much my autopilot experience as far as my battery degradation I will try and make a full video on my one-year review my likes and dislikes of the car I just want to give you guys a little quick preview of 2020 point 20.12 which is a long number maybe I should share some fallout shelter video gameplay footage it's pretty much the same thing as the mobile
