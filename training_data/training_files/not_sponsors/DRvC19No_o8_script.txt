one of my light stands just broke so welcome back to bla bla bla bla bla bla bla the show where I talk about what it takes to make stuff and this episode is online store make it with Squarespace really echo in here I'm still getting everything set up sorry so today I'm gonna talk about two things I was sent this month first it's a silver play button I got it first surpassing 100,000 subscribers obviously I've gotten a lot more since they mailed this but all the same it's pretty cool I couldn't have reached this milestone without you also all I can say is thanks thanks for supporting my channel and continuing to encourage me in all of this and the second thing is this a dude or maybe dudette named Jesse sent me this kind message in which he or she asked me for advice on how to write scripts Jesse thanks for your question today I'm gonna do my best to answer it okay so first full disclosure despite what the internet seems to think I wouldn't consider myself a successful screenwriter I've written a lot of scripts but the vast majority of them like the movies they spawned usually end up in the trash I didn't think that through however I can still probably impart just enough wisdom to get you started so the first thing that you need to know is that screenplays have a particular form and language when you open up a screenplay for the first time you're gonna notice that it looks a lot different than a traditional book and you'll notice it looks different than a stage play why well because each of these things are formatted in a very specific way for a specific reason screenplays are structured in a way to make shooting easy this is accomplished by using different margins and font styles for things like scene headings action characters dialogue even transitions these are all placed the way they are so that the director and the cast and crew can quickly and conveniently find their way around the scene movie shoots need to be organized and screenplays are organized accordingly another benefit of this structure is that it can give you a general idea of the film's runtime with a rule of thumb being that one page equals one minute though this is an average approximation and not a set in stone guarantee a collaborative medium like film requires every part of the production to be on the same page literally so if you to make movies you're going to have to learn how to read and with any luck right in this structure don't be intimidated I'm about as slow a learner as they come and even I was able to pick it up nowadays with screenwriting software it's really easy you don't even have to know the measurements of the margins like the old typewriter generation screenwriting software handles it all and you can get a hold of set software for next to nothing final draft is simple to use powerful and the industry standard for professional screenwriters but be prepared to pay for it fade-in is affordable offers the most stability and has a whole slew of amazing options that extend into actual production and if you're not yet in the place where you can shell out any money you can always try write or duet it's free and while not as extensive as the other two it still has more than enough options to get you started but software means absolutely nothing if you don't know how to read the language of screenplays so to do that you're gonna have to do some reading probably the go-to book to learn the ins and outs of script writing is the screenwriters Bible by David trotty err it's basically five books and one that teach you everything from script formatting to getting your finished story sold is available at most bookstores and it's been around long enough that even if you're strapped for cash a used copy probably won't run you too much and of course if you're absolutely broke you could always support your local library and just get a copy for free actually I wonder if my local library has a copy that'd be interesting to know let's go find out they've got it by the way if you live near the library Center in Springfield Missouri I might have left a little gift inside this one toward the back this is a bad idea yeah that's about as cold as I was expecting now if you want a book on the subject that's a little more entertaining than that then I would recommend save the cat the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need by Blake Snyder I hear really good things but look a bit of warning when you're just starting out don't get too caught up in formatting there's nothing worse than screenwriting snobs who care more about whether you're using the proper margin spacing than whether and how the story is actually good focus first on finding and writing a good story formatting and all of that junk can always be done later after the story is complete especially if you're going to be the director remember that screenplays are made in revisions you're not gonna get it all right on the first go this is the first draft of sprouting orchids my first attempt at actually producing a feature film this is the draft we shot with it was the 12th iteration of the script and lots of bad stuff had been changed in revision believe me this is good when I'm writing I find that the first draft usually contains just about every idea that I can come up with and then each subsequent draft is meant to refine the overall picture characters scenes and dialogue are often combined and even eliminated this is the process of separating the wheat from the chaff but you're probably thinking yeah yeah wheat chaff whatever where do I start here's what I do it starts with the idea the seed of the story whether I have a certain scene in my mind or a character or a conflict something that packs is a spark for the story so where do you get ideas all around you go outside and walk around and observe things meet and talk to people let them tell you their stories live your life experience adversity and eventually you will find inspiration so since we keep talking about sprouting orchids that dia came from a man I met named bill bill is 87 years old and I met him at a church in a small town called Mountain Grove Missouri bill served in the military and afterward worked as an auto mechanic and restored classic cars bill was Superman in his younger years but by the time I met him he was battling his way back from a serious stroke he suffered that left him paralyzed and unable to take care of himself listening to him tell me his stories reinforced the notion that life can change in the blink of an eye and that often seemingly unimaginable tragedies are overcome by older people every single day because through the years they've gained patience persistence and toughness so the idea spawn was what if someone who hadn't developed those character traits went through what Bill did what if a relatively young person suffered a stroke and had to battle his or her way back if this sounds poetic it's because I'm reading from my original notes I cannot come up with this stuff on the spot believe me so after the idea was in place I then wrote a treatment in other words a brief summary of my story this doesn't have to be fancy I basically take a notepad and I write out three paragraphs beginning middle and end I don't spend too much time on this seriously maybe 20 minutes tops you don't need to be specific and it doesn't have to reflect the final film this is all fluid none of it is set in stone so just scribble out a story as if you were forced to come up with a pitch on the spot then I move to the outline here's where things start to get a bit more specific despite what you may have heard there is no standard official format for outlines here's what the original outline for the movie big fish looked like here's a look at the first outline for sprouting orchids your outline is basically a quick map of the various scenes this story will have you don't have to be specific just a single sentence explaining what the scene is and where it's taking the story will do I tend to handwrite mine and I always try and write my outlines while standing but you do whatever makes you comfortable next I usually start doing what I call scene breakdowns although this entire step is optional I basically take an index card and I write a little bit more information about each scene including some brief action Beats and even a bit of dialogue if I have something in my head I use index cards because I can jump around from seeing this scene more easily as the ideas flow again I hand write this I try and stay away from typing until I know the general direction that I'm going after all that I then sit down and tackle the first draft I write quickly and uncritically if I can't come up with the right word on the spot I leave a blank with the occasional note about what I'm hunting for and I keep going I write my character names knowing that they won't be final and if I come to a scene where I'm not sure what to do or have the characters say I skip it just filling it in with what I wrote in either the outline or the scene breakdown the point is I don't stop to write things I'm not in the mood to write I get right to the interesting scenes I'm wanting to tackle and I tackle them remember that no one will ever read your first draft so don't waste time trying to make it pretty you're crafting a skeleton that will be altered again and again and again long before it will ever see the light of day after the first draft is done I usually take a break I step away from the story for a bit and do other things then once I've had a chance to clear my head I come back to it I read it and then if I'm still excited about it I start revising read revise read revise read revise read revise again and again and again and again until you notice the story seems to be pretty locked in at this point I then start sending the screenplay to other people for them to take a look at this can be anything from professional editors to possible production members I tend to send screenplays to people who will either be helping me shoot it or to people I know who can provide me a different perspective and feedback beyond good job bro for sprouting orchids I primarily relied upon three people the first was Kyle a friend of mine who is a former theatre teacher and now works adjunct at the University of North Texas Lance who was the cinematographer for the film and Arielle who did her best to offer me a more feminine perspective for certain characters have these advisors read the screenplay and offer you constructive criticism by way of story notes take their considerations to heart it is easy to fall in love with something simply by nature of having worked on it for about a because of that it is really easy for you to blind yourself to your story's flaws by this point your screenplay will start to be a little more concrete and honestly at that point it's up to you to decide when to put a cap on it and with that a few last pieces of advice remember that the screenplay will always be just a blueprint of the film and that once you get on set circumstances will change things actors abilities to perform the lines convincingly set availability the weather props technical limitations production deadlines all of these will dictate in some way how the screenplay is brought to life respect the script but don't become a slave to it it's okay to change things once you start shooting if what you've written just doesn't work if you're still unsure about where to start go online and check out screenplays of great films they won't take too long to read and just like reading great books to become a better author reading great screenplays can help make you a better screenwriter maybe you just don't have any ideas here's an exercise to help get you started pick your favorite movie and then write the screenplay for it shouldn't take too long since the entire finished film is right in front of you but transcribe what you watch in screenplay format after you've finished ask yourself what you would change about the movie keep doing that until you've grown comfortable writing in the screenplay format and then you can try your hand at an original story so there you go there's my advice take it or leave it do you like videos like this then you domain do you guys have any screen writing exercise ideas I'm curious if you do put them in the comments alright I can't think of anything else Thea [Music] [Music]
