between mezzanine construction organization and frankly just way more important projects this one has kind of fallen through the cracks but finally months after our first one arrived we're digging through what is hopefully not a large pile of brushed aluminum garbage to find the best MacBook stands [Music] stay tuned for an awesome offer from them later on in the video so at the end of our search we ended up with eight macbook pro stands mostly because it's a common search term and we want people to find our video but also because nothing prevents someone from using a macbook stand with a razor blade or whatever else unless they're terminally unimaginative so first up is roosts roost stand two out of ten named terrible but anyway the product itself is pretty cool it's by far the most compact stand and our roundup and quickly folds down to thirteen inches making it perfect for carting around with you so you can quickly prop your laptop up in class or at a LAN party or wherever you happen to be with that said it's not my favorite as a permanent desk installation because it's wobble control is unexceptional at best and it's molded plastic and nylon elastic construction at this price point didn't really blow us away 12 South's new stand the curve is more of a desk fixture solution than a portable one and it's IMO by far the most aesthetically pleasing stand in our roundup today and I'm pretty sure this one is gonna end up in Ed's apartment at some point but it's not the most rigid stand in our lineup and on my admittedly kind of shaky desk it's a little bit jarring on something more solid though it works well enough so if you're after a stand for looks this one gets our recommendation rain designs n stand comes in two attractive variants the M stand and the M stand 360 and in three different colors as you'd probably guess the 360 variant spins around so my first thought was POS system maybe but then I was like who the heck uses a Macbook as a point-of-sale system so yeah according to rain design it's meant as collaboration tool so I'll leave it up to your imagination there as a stand it's pretty darn good with basically no wobble but as a heat sink seriously you guys it's obviously complete unless you apply a generous layer of thermal goop to the bottom of your macbook every time you use it I mean rubber feet and a sizable air gap anyone hello anyway adjustable stands are more my jam so let's look at a few those now Rain design to eye level has a clean Apple esque aesthetic and a good degree of adjustability but the laptop holding plate is simply too thin resulting in an unacceptable amount of wobble regardless of your desk the near five-star rating on Amazon frankly didn't make a ton of sense to me until I realized that many people were probably using this product with a 13-inch MacBook Air and that should be fine twelve South's high rise for MacBook is honestly no better the laptop platform is wimpy and doesn't properly support the 15-inch pro this adjustment mechanism feels like they sacrificed usability to tick off the adjustable feature box and frankly I think it looks way better upside down I mean seriously check that out they should do a revision where it's just they move the the pads around and it's just upside down bringing us finally then to a product worth your money the crane stand elevates this bad boy has all the features without any usability compromises its three-way adjustable with bottom and top joints as well as extensions on the support to get a huge range of motion as you would expect from a stand targeted at DJ's and while it's a little more time consuming to adjust once you get it in the right spot thanks to the little teeth that lock in place it does not move my only gripe with this one is that it looks like a piece of production equipment and that's not in a good way so if you're a modern design hipster you'll probably want to stay away from this one last but not least is 12 South's Park Slope it's kind of in its own category were features and that there really aren't any of them it's all in the name it slopes your laptop when you park it on top putting our 15-inch MacBook Pro at just the right angle for comfortable typing similar to the kick stands on the back of your keyboard the extra screen height is neck friendly and as you can probably imagine this one doesn't wobble I honestly just wish they had used this gage and steel material on some of the other stands so in conclusion what stand to buy if aesthetics been the curve or the M stand they're both sturdy and look great so it's just a matter of which one matches your setup best for adjustability the only real option here is the crane stand I wouldn't even consider the other two unless you're rocking a thin and light and as for an elevated experience my go-to is 12 South's Park Slope it's fine but we also didn't have anything else from this category in the roundup so oh look at the time
