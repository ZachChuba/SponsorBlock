jobber Oh last night built onto a legacy that is just gonna be incredible I think he obviously had a broken rib I could say that on this show I couldn't officially say it on the mega cast he played in a second half with a broken rib where it's very difficult to breathe he played in the second half with a broken rib where it's very hard to open it up and he willed his team to a national championship in their home state and everybody lost their absolute mind I love the Trevor Lawrence walked off the field underneath a purple and yellow confetti that I would assume is gonna drive him to come back even better Trevor Lawrence is never lost in college so that means he has just a moment of motivation there while walking into that locker room it looks like he is gonna have a revenge tour revenge body somehow next year and I can't wait for that happy to hear he's gonna come back and play football though I mean I think that is something that we could definitely lock in there's been conversations of him not coming back and playing because he's definitely gonna be the number one pick which I think is still true by the way regardless what happens last night regardless of the overthrows that had which was 12 or 13 of them last night I think he was pressing a little bit cuz he al Asiri defense was so good I think he has to come back next year and he's gonna come back even better which is good for college football Joe burrow though Dan Orlovsky and I we walked home from the stadium with that of Amin and we ran into the Chris out to the Chris Lee family by the way the littlest one which I feel like I've watched grown up in there Chris Lee knows and best show I guess he watches our stuff sometimes so big trait of that kid also the son big tray of them shout to the Chris Lee's I'm one of their biggest fans that that exists just because Todd is electrifying but as we were walking home the conversation with LSU fans started to happen about how good Joe burrow is and I said well obviously he's gonna go to Cincinnati I said it there in Dan Orlovsky is Dan Orlovsky obviously and I don't know if Dan which is trying to prod these drunk White's we're an LSU close but he said somebody's gonna go get him dan thinks there's a chance after that performance and how Joe has done all year that somebody's gonna want to move and get up there and if Cincinnati lets that happen that would be the most six and a dbag little thing about first order from seeking now back to the magic that guy has everything you need to be a franchise quarterback he can throw the ball into a bucket he proved that last night with JC I mean he dropped balls right into a bucket he has the most touchdowns in FBS history and he played in the SEC it wasn't like he was playing in the old pac-12 or whatever wherever there was just tempo throw like cope Breton was in Hawaii or whatever he played in the SEC and he has the most touchdown passes in the history of college football he has the highest completion percentage in the history of college football he has this moxie and grit about him where we think he played through an entire broken rib and he has this confidence about him and swagger that I think is maybe my favorite thing though he's smoking cigars and celebrating life afterwards but at all look at that just came straight out of a movie he just nodded his head with a cigar thing but he has the humility is great he has gratitude he has every single character trait you could possibly want for a guy to be your franchise quarterback let alone the thought that he had to sit on the bench of bet on himself and transfer and struggled and do very well so if Cincinnati lets that get out of their francese which once they until Dan mentioned it on the street last night to a very drunk white named Josh i I didn't even fathom it Joe Joe borough is gonna be a superstar and if a quarterback super star in the fourth quarter there after he led to come back and his ribs are broken or whatever they that the LSU crowd does this thing I guess right they start playing in that next song and you saw Ryan Clark doing it it swag dude doing it what they didn't show on the cast that they showed on the jumbotron was Joe Borough like classic just with his head like doing like this thing and as soon as his face was shown their eruption I mean it was absolute eruption and when we were walking around in the pregame he had this look on his face as if he knew everything that was just about to happen there's just like he has this confidence about him yet Hugh it's just he has everything about Enys a lot faster I think then I even imagine after seeing him in person in that third or in the second quarter who in a second quarter drived at the end of the half there where he was getting out of the pocket and running a lot I was like damn he's a lot faster than I thought he was you factor that in with the winning trait that he has and not only in basketball and everything that he does this guy is a lock for the NFL and I'll be interested to see if there's people making moves to try to get up there because this is a guy you want on your team
