>> WELL, IT'S A MILD AFTERNOON,  A SLIGHT BREEZE OVER AT THE  COSMO DROME IN KAZAKSTAN.  AND SITTING 160 F HIGH,  TO LAUNCH TO THE INTERNATIONAL  SPACE STATION, NASA'S CHRIS  CASSIDY.  AND ANATOLI, AND EVAN WAGNER,  SET TO PLAST OFF IN UNDER AN  HOUR FROM NOW AT 3:05 CENTRAL  TIME.  4:05:00 EASTERN TIME HERE IN THE US.  THIS IS THE FIRST CREW LAUNCH ON THE SOYUZ BOOSTER.  LAUNCHING FROM THE COSMO DROME.  IT WAS LAUNCHED DURING AN  UNMANNED MISSION LAST SUMMER IN  PREPARATION FOR TODAY.  AND WILL BE THE FIRST LAUNCH  FROM SITE 31 SINCE OCTOBER 2016, WHEN NASA'S SHANE KIMBA LAUNCHED ON SOYUZ 0-2 AS PART OF MISSION  49.  GOOD MORNING, GOOD AFTERNOON,  GOOD EVENING.  ANYWHERE YOU ARE TUNING IN.  I'M COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM THE  JOHNSON SPACE CENTER HERE IN  HOUSTON.  WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE  COUNTDOWN OF THE LAUNCH.  THE RIDE UPHILL AND THE JOURNEY  TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE  STATION OVER THE NEXT  SEVERAL HOURS. DOCKING AND ARRIVING AND GETTING THE CREW UP TO A FULL SIX-PERSON STRENGTH. LAUNCH CONTROLLERS ARE WATCHING  THE SYSTEMS ON THE ROCKET,  TALKING TO THE CREW AND LOOKING  AT EVERYTHING ON THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.  NO ISSUES TRACKED W.  FUEL AND OXYGEN LOADING FOR THE  SOYUZ BEGAN A FEW HOURS AGO. ONE OF THE TEAMS ON THE LEFT  THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IS IN  RUSSIA, THE CONTROL CENTER,  OUTSIDE IN COMMONWEALTH ORYOV  AND THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE  STATION HERE IN HOUSTON, COMING  TO YOU.  WE ARE HOPING BETWEEN CONTROL  ROOMS.  FLIGHT CONTROL REALLY NUMBER  ONE, THE USUAL INTERNATIONAL  SPACE STATION CONTROL ROOM.  IN MICHIGAN CONTROL THE TEAM  WATCHING OVER THE CURRENT  EXPEDITION CREW.  OUR FLIGHT DIRECTOR IS ANTHONY  VARIER.  HE'LL LEAD THE ORBIT ONE TEAM  AND NEXT TO HIM IS EUROPEAN  ASTRONAUT ANDREA MOGUSEN.  THE CAPCOMM.  THE VOICE COMMUNICATION FOR  EVERYONE ON HOUSTON.  ON BOARD IS JESSICA MEIR AND  ANDREW MORGAN, AND THEY ARE UP  THERE WITH RUSSIAN COSMO NAUGHT  AND SPACE STATION COMMANDER OLEG SKRIPOCHKA.  ANDREW MORGAN LAUNCHED ON  JULY 20TH LAST SUMMER, 50th  ANNIVERSARY OF HUMANITY'S FIRST  STEP.  JESSICA MEIR FOLLOWED SHORTLY  AFTER, LAUNCH, IN SEPTEMBER.  ONCE THE CREW GETS THERE.  THE CREW WILL BE UP TO SIX.  R A WEEK.  ANDREW MORGAN AND OLEG  SKRIPOCHKA MAKE THEIR WAY BACK  TO PLANET EARTH ON APRIL 17TH,  BRINGING THE SPACE STATION DOWN  TO THREE.  AS I MENTIONED A LITTLE EARLIER, DOCKING FOR THE NEW CREW OCCURS  SEVERAL HOURS FROM NOW, AFTER  COMPLETING THE FOUR ORBIT  FLIGHT.  WE'LL BRING YOU COVERAGE OF THAT ON NASA TV. 8:30AM CENTRAL TIME FOR DOCKING. THEY ARE SCHEDULED TO DOCK AND  THE ZONA, NESDA, IT'S KNOWN AS M 45 MINUTES AFTER SEEING THE  COVERAGE WE SEE THE DOCKING.  ON THE JOURNEY UP THERE, THE  SOYUZ TRACKING AND TELOMETRY  WILL BE LINKED TO SPACE  STATIONSLINGED TO THE CONTROL  CENTER.  THROUGHOUT THE COVERAGE FOR THE  LAUNCH AND THE DOCKING AND HAT OPENING LATER.  IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS THAT  WANT TO ASK.  WE'LL TAKE A COUPLE ON TWITTER,  YOU CAN ASK, USING THE HASHTAG  ASK NASA.  WE'LL TRY TO GET THROW A BUNCH  OF THOSE LATER ON.  TODAY'S LAUNCH IS NOTABLE FOR  THE FIR BEING THAT THIS CREW  UNDER WENT THEIR FINAL SPACE  FLIGHT PREPARATIONS DURING THE  HEALTH EMERGENCY ON THE  COVID-19, CHANGING THINGS TORE  PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE GLOBE,  THIS CREW AND THEIR PREPARATION  NO DIFFERENT.  THINGS LOOKING A LITTLE  DIFFERENT.  LIK A LOT OF OTHER THINGS.  YOU SEE THE PERSONNEL TRIMMED TO THE BARE NECESSITIES. ALL THE THEY DO EVERYTHING TO  STOP THEW WITH SICKNESS. THEY BEEN QUARANTINED FOR TWO  WEEKS, THEY HAVE BEEN IN  QUARANTINE FOR TWO WEEKS,  LAMENTING CONTACT FOR THOSE  CLEARED AND IN QUARANTINE  THEMSELVES. IT'S STANDARDPROCEDURE, WE WANT TO KEEP THEM HEALTHY, WE DON'T  WANT THEM TO BRING A COLD OR  ANYTHING SEVERE UP TO THE SPACE  STATION. THE.  THANKS TO THE PROTOCOL THE CREW  SAFE AND READY TO LAUNCH. A NOTEWORTHY ASPECT IS DURING  THEIR STAY WE ARE EXPECTING THE  FIRST EVER CREW LAUNCH.  SIMILAR TO A FLIGHT, CURLY WILL  BE LAUNCHING IN.  THEY ARE EXPECTED TO LAUNCH  BETWEEN MID TO LATE MAY.  AND ALL T TEAMS DOWN HERE ON  THE GROUND CONDITIONING.  ALL CREW FINISHING UP TRAINING  AND EVERYONE HAPPY TO SEE THE  SPACE FLIGHTS RETURNING.  THAT WILL TAKE PLACE DURING  EXPEDITION 63.  THE CREW WILL BE ON BOARD WHERE  WE CELEBRATE THE 20th  ANNIVERSARY.  YOU SEE THE I.S. S 20 AND A  BUNCH OF STUFF OVER NASA TV. WE ARE MARKING 20 YEARS OF HUMAN BEINGS LIVING ON BOARD THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.  EVERY DAY SINCE NOVEMBER 1,  '99 -- NOVEMBER 2000 WE HAVE HAD MEN AND WOMEN LIVING ON BOARD  THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THERE IS AN ENTIRE GENERATION ON PLANET EARTH THAT AS LONG AS  THEY HAVE BEEN ALIVE.  NOT EVERY HUMAN HAS BEEN ON  EARTH WITH THEM. WE ARE CELEBRATING THAT  ACCOMPLISHMENT.  THAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK FROM A  LOT OF DIFFERENT TEAMS,  ORGANIZATIONS, GOVERNMENTS AND  DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS.  THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING THEM  24 HOURS A DAY, 365 DAYS A YEAR  AND WE'LL HIT THE 20 YEAR MARK  IN NOVEMBER.  THAT MILESTONE MEANT SOMETHING  SPECIAL TO CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY,  AND HE HAD A COUPLE OF WORDS TO  SHARE. >> WELL, IT'S SIGNIFICANT FOR  THE SPACE STATION IT'S BEEN  OPERATING BRILLIANTLY FOR THOSE  20 YEARS, FOR ME PERSONALLY,  BILL SHEPHERD WAS THE COMMANDER  OF EXPEDITION 1.  I'M THE COMMANDER OF EXPEDITION  23 AT THE 20 YEAR MARK.  WE HAVE OUR ROOTS IN THE NAVY  SEAL TEAMS, I HAVE A  PARTICULARLY THOUGHT ABOUT HOW  THE NAVY GUISES IN COMMAND AND  THE BEGINNING AND END OF THAT 20 YEAR PERIOD. IT ALSSHOWSES THAT  THAT WE AS A COLLECTION OF  NATIONS BUILT, SUSTAINED,  OPERATED THE SPACE STATION, AND  ALL THAT SPEAKER  WE ARE  LEARNING, WILL HELP US GO TO THE MOON, MARS.  IMAGINE YOUR CAR WORKING FOR 20  YEARS, YOU ARE HAPPY WHEN YOU  GET TO THE 20th YEAR, AND THE  SPACE STATION IS DOING BETTER  THAN YOUR CAR. >> THEY ARE QUICK WORDS. WE WANT TO GET TO KNOW THE CREW  ON BOARD THE SOYUZ A LITTLE  MORE.  LET'S LEARN ABOUT NASA'S  CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY.  IN THE RIGHT HANDS SEAT IS  NASA'S ASTRONAUT CHRISTOPHER  CASSIDY.  LECTED IN 2004, TWO SPACE  FLIGHTS AND SIX SPACE WALKS ON  HIS RESUME, A DECORATED NAVY  SKILL AND CALLS THE CITY OF  NORTH BAY HIHOME. HE WAS BORN IN 1970 IN SALEM  MASSACHUSETTS, AND ATTENDED YORK HIGH SCHOOL.  CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY HOLDS  DEGREES FROM SEVERAL  INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING A  BACHELOR OF SCIENCE AND  MATHEMATICS FROM THE UNITED  STATES ACADEMY AND A MASTER OF  MOTION AND ENGINEERING FROM THE  MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF  TECHNOLOGY, HE SERVED AS A NAVY  SE FOR 11 YEARS BEFORE BEING  ELECTED AS AN ASTRONAUT.  BEING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN,  AWARDED TWO BRONZE STARS AND  RECOGNITION.  HE BECAME A NAVY CAPTAIN IN 20  SH, AND NEVER -- 2014 AND NEVER  WAS ONE TO BACK DOWN TO A  CHALLENGE. N ASTRONAUT HE MADE   JOURNEY INTO SPACE ON JULY 23,  '00 THE ABORE CAPE CANNES AV RAL ABOARD THE SHUTTLE.  HE AND THE REST OF THE CREW  ASSEMBLED THE FINAL PARTS.  ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS DELIVERED AND STORED AROUND FOR FUTURE USE OP THEERNATIONAL SPACE  STATION.  AND THIS MISSION WAS A 500th  PERSON HISTORY TO FLY IN SPACE. CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY FLEW FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 2013.  AND HIS FIRST LAUNCH.  HE HAS LOGGED 182 DAYS IN SPACE  31 HOURS AND 14 MINUTES SPACE  WALKING TIME. ACK ON EARTH ME W  CHIEF ASTRONAUT AND AWARDED AN  EXCEPTIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. HE'LL TAKE OVER AS THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION NEXT WEEK, AND THE CURRENT  MISUNDERSTANDER OLEG SKRIPOCHKA  HANDS OVER THE KEY FOR THE  CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONY.  HE'S JOINED BY TWO COSMONAUTS.  ANATOLY IVANISHIN AND IVAN  VAGNER.  AND WE'LL TAKE A MOMENT TO GET  TO KNOW THEM.  WE ARE 52 MINUTES AND 35 SECONDS AWAY FROM LAUNCH. >> SEATED IN THE CAPSULE'S  SECOND SEAT IS SOYUZ MS-16  COMMANDER ANATOLY IVANISHIN.  HE IS A DECORATED RETIRED  RUSSIAN AIR FORCE COLONEL  ASSIGNED IN 2003, COMPLETING HIS TRAINING AND EXAMINATION IN  2005. HE WAS BORN IN 1969 IN RUSSIA,  LOCATE IN SIBERIA.  HE WOULD GO ON TO GRADUATE HIGH  SCHOOL IN 1986.  AND AIR FORCE PILOT SCHOOL IN  RUSSIA IN 1991.  HE HOLDS SEVERAL PILOT LICENCES  AND LOGS 550 HOURS FLYING. HIS FLIGHT MARKS THE THIRD SPACE FLIGHT OF HIS COSMO NAUGHT  CAREER, HE TRAVELLED TO SPACE IN NOVEMBER 2011 AS SPACE STATION  EXPEDITION 29 AND 30.  HE RETURNS TO THE STATION IN  SERVING AS COMMANDER ABOARD THE  FLIGHTS IN THE M.S. SERIES OF  SPACECRAFTS YOU SEE TODAY. HE HAS 2LE # 0 DAYS OF FLIGHTS  UNDER HIS BELT.  AND SEVERAL SPACE RELATED  RECOGNITIONS, INCLUDING THE 50th ANNIVERSARY, NASA SPACE FLIGHT  MET MALED AND DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC SERVICE. TO THE LEFT OF ANATOLY  IVANISHIN, PREPARING FOR HIS  FIRST EVER JOURNEY INTO SPACE IS COSMO NAUGHT IVAN VAGNER. HE WAS ASSIGNED IN OCTOBER 2010  AND CERTIFIED AS A 10th COSMO  NAUGHT IN AUGUST 2012.  HE COMES FROM A TOWN LOGHT IN  THE WESTERN REGION OF RUSSIA, IN GRADUATING IN 2002 AND WENT ON  TO TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY IN ST.  PETERSBURG RUSSIA, EARNING A  MASTER OF SCIENCE IN SPACE  ROCKET SHIPS. HE HELD SEVERAL POSITIONS IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY INCLUDING WORKING AS AN ENGINEER EAR.  HAVING SPENT THE PAST FEW WEE  TRAINING FOR WARES EXPEDITIONS,  HE IS LOGGING HIS OWN TOTAL TIME IN SPACE TO A FEW HOURS. >> AND THAT MUSIC THAT YOU HEAR  IS ACTIVELY PUMPED THE  SOYUZ SPACECRAFT, IT'S COMMON  FOR THE FLIGHT CONTROLLERS TO  PUMP IN THE MUSIC TO THE CREW  WHILE THEY ARE STRAPPED IN.  THEY HAVE BEEN ON BOARD THE  SOYUZ FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. AND NOW WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT  WHAT THEIR PATH WAS LIKE TO GET  THERE.  THE DAY'S ACTIVITIES IN BAIKONUR BEGAN A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, THE CREW AWAKENED 6:00p.m. CENTRAL  TIME ON APRIL 8TH.  IT WAS 4 IN THE MORNING IN  BAIKONUR.  THE CREW, CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY  THERE, WALKING OUT OF THE COSMO  NAUGHT HOTEL.  BEFORE LEAVING THEY WENT THROUGH THE TIME-HONORED TRADITIONFUL  SIGNING THE DOORS -- TRADITION  OF SIGNING THEDOORS.  THERS A LOT OF TRADITIONS  YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT AND SEE  SEVERAL OF THOSE, THE CREW  SIGNED DOORS AND DID THE WALK  OUT.  USUALLY A LOT MORE CROWDS PACKED THERE.  AGAIN, IN LIGHT OF THE SITUATION FEWER PEOPLE TO SEE THEM OFF ON  THEIR WAY.  THEYEPORTED AND BOARDED --  DEPARTED AND BOARDED A BUS FOR A 45 MINUTE DRIVE.  THE DESTINATION AT THE FACILITY, BUILDING 254 ON THE COSMO DROME  GROUNDS. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PRIEST ON THE  LEFT.  ANOTHER TRADITION. THERE TOSS THE CREWS IN THE  MORNING, TYPICALLY ONE OR TWO  DAYS BEFORE THE LAUNCH AFTER  IT'S ERECTED ON THE  . HERE WE SEE THEM ARRIVING AT  THEIR FIRST DESTINATION OF THE  DAY, THAT'S THE INTEGRATION,  BUILDING 254 ON THE COSMODRONE.  ONCE THEY GET THERE, EACH OF THE CREW MEMBER UNDER GOES A MEDICAL EXAM.  THIS IS THE SUIT YOU CAN SEE  GETTING IN HERE.  THESE ARE SUITS THAT CAN BE  PRESSURE ICED IN THE --  PRESSURISED IN THE EVENT OF  PRESSURE LOST, PROVIDING  PRESSURE, BREATHING GASES FOR  THE CREW MEMBERS, THEY ARE  ASSISTED BY A NUMBER OF SUIT  TEXTS, SOME OF THEM MORE  INTERESTING PARTS ON THE FRONT.  IT'S HOW THEY CAN ADJUST THE  PRESSURE INSIDE OF THE SUIT  ITSELF. EACH CREW MEMBER FITTED WITH A  COMCAP, A SNAPPY CAP WITH  MICROPHONES AND EAR PIECES  INSIDE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH  OTHER AND THE LAUNCH CONDUCTORS  DOWN THERE, AND ONCE IN ORBIT.  WITH THELIGHT CONTROLLER DOWN ON THE GROUND. ANATOLY IVANISHIN SUITED UP  FIRST AND JOINED BY IVAN VAGNER, MAKING A FIRST FLIGHT IN TODAY. THIS WILL BE ANATOLY IVANISHIN'S THIRD AND CHRISTOPHER    THIRD. LAST BUT NOT LEAST JOINED BY  INTO HIS SUIT. SIDY, GETTING  TAKING PLACE IN THE SUIT UP AND  INTEGRATION BUILDING ON THE  BAIKONUR COSMODRONE, THEY HAVE  THE FINAL MEDICAL EXAM, TWO  TRAINED TECHNICIANS HELP THEM  GET INTO THE GROUP.  THEY'LL WE ARE THESE FOR THE  DYNAMIC PHASES OF FLIGHT AND FOR THE SHORT DRIPS, RELATIVELY  SHORT SIX HOURS.  TWO DAYS, VERSAL YEARS AGO.  THEY'LL STAY IN THE SUITS PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE TIME DOCKING AND GETTING OUT OF THE SUITS AFTER  THEY DOCK TO THE SPACE STATIONS  AND BEFORE THEY OPEN THE  HATCHES.  HE SUT UP THEY MOVE INTO  THE NEXT ROOM, WHICH HAS PANE OF GLASS, THIS IS TYPICALLY WHERE  WE SEE CREW MEMBERS, AFTER GOING THROUGH A PRESSURE CHECK, GET A  CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH FRIENDS,  FAMILY THAT WERE ABLE TO TRAVEL  TO THE LAUNCH SITE.  AND ALSO AS PERSONNEL, WE SEE  NASA PEREL THERE, TRISHA  MACK, THE HEAD OF NASA OFFICE IN MOSCOW, CAUGHT IN ALL THE  ACTIVITIES FOR CREWS FLYING AND  RETURNING FROM THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT.  JOHN MCBRINE HELPING OUT WITH  THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE OVER THERE  AS WELL. INDIVIDUALS AT THE LAUNCH,   TYPICALLY YOU SEE A LARGER  CONTINGENT.  FAMILY, FRIENDS ABLE TO TRAVEL,  OR NOT ABLE TO DO IT TO  BAIKONUR, WITH THE TRAVEL MOSCO  FAMILY, FRIENDS ABLE TO TRAVEL,  OR NOT ABLE TO DO IT TO  BAIKONUR, WITH THE TRAVEL  RESTRICTIONS.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PURPOSE,  THIS IS WHERE THEYRESSURE TEST THE SUIT.  YOU SEE IT PLUGGED IN.  THEY GET INTO A SUIT, A MOCK-UP  OF THE SOYUZ ITSELF.  ANATOLY IVANISHIN IS IN THERE,  AND HIS SUIT PUMPS UP A LITTLE  BIT.  THEY ARE PRESSURISED.  THEY ARE BREATHING GAS.  A SIMILAR COMPOSITION OF WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR ATMOSPHERE HERE ON  EARTH, FED INTO THE SUITS, AND  ABLE TOPRESSURE.  FOR ALL OF THE PHASES OF THE  FLIGHT.  ALL OF THE ASSETS, RENDEZVOUSES, AND THEY'LL BE IN THE SAME SUIT WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR WAY HOME.  AN INTERESTING NOTE ABOUT THE  SUITS, THIS IS A MOCK-UP OF THE  SUITS AND THE SEAT.  EACH OF THE CREW MEMBERS HAS A  SPECIALLY MOULDED SEAT LINER  THAT THEY SIT IN.  A VERSION OF WHAT IVAN VAGNER IS IN NOW, PLASTER MOULD IS  POURED AROUND TO CONFORM TO  THEIR BODY, AND THEY HAVE A  SPECIAL SEAT LINER, AND THAT'S  WHY EVERY CREW MEMBER AS AN  ASSIGNED SEAT.  CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY IS IN THE  RIGHT SEAT TODAY.  IN THE LEFT SEAT IS THE BACK UP. AND THE CENTER SEE, SOYUZ  COMMANDER SITS.  PRIMED FOR ALL OF THE VEHICLES  OPERATIONS, MANUAL CONTROL OF  THE VEHICLE.  THEY HAVE TO TAKE OVER FOR  RENDEZVOUS AT DOCKING OR ANY  OTHER FADESES OF THE FLIGHT: ONE BY ONE THE CREW GOES THROUGH  GETTING A CHANCE TO DO THE  PRESSURE CHECKS.  WE WILL NOT SEE THE INTERACTION  THROUGH THE GLASS, THE MEDIA.  FAMILY AND INDUSTRYCIALS  WE NOT PERMITTED TO TRAVEL TO  THE LAUNCH ZONE FOR THIS, AGAIN, KEEPING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE CREW PARAMOUNT IN ALL OF THE PLANNING.  GAIN, THE INDIVIDUALS -- AGAIN,  THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE ROOM ARE  REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE SAME  QUARANTINE AS THE CREW OR WEAR  THE P.P.E.  PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO INTERACT.  THIS IS A STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR EVERY INTERNATIONAL CREW.  IT'S HEALTH STABILIZATION.  IT'S BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS WE  HAVE BEEN DOING THE  . >> READY FOR LAUNCH, GOOD LUCK  GUYS, YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING  YOU COULD DURING YOUR ADVANTAGE, EVERYTHING IS ON BOARD. EVERYTHING WITH THE LAUNCH.  EVERYTHING WILL  LOGGED. HI, GUYS. [ CROWD NOISE ] IN SPITE EVERYTHING, YOU ARE  KEEPING YOUR COOL.  AND THERE IS NO RUSH.  SLOW AND STEADY TAKES IT. >> YOU WORKED SO HARD TO GET  HERE.  I HOPE EVERYTHING GOES  PERFECTLY, ENJOY EVERY MOMENT.  ENJOY YOUR KNEW HOME AND KNOW WE ARE ON THE GROUND.  TAKE CARE. >> I SUGGEST YOU WEAR SHOULDE  STRAPS. CREW IS READY TO WALK OUT. THEY COME OUT. THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT.  THE CREW RECORDING THATHEY ARE READY: MAINTAINING THE TRADITION ONE  FINAL TIME, DECLARING THEY ARE  READY FOR LAUNCH, AND ON THE WAY TO BUS. WAVING THERE.  CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY.  THEY RIDE PAST . >> ONCE THE CREW ARRIVE, AND THE OFFICIALS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE  AGENCIES, ABLE TO LEAD THEM TO  THE FINAL STEPS BEFORE THEY MAKE THEIR WAY UP TO THE ELEVATOR,  TAKING THEM TO THE TOP OF THE  SOYUZ BOOSTER.  150 FEET TALL SITTING ON TOP OF THE PROTECTIVE LAUNCH    THEY CLIMB UP AND WAVE FOOD BUY  TO THE FINAL WELL-WISHERS,  RIDING THE ELEVATOR TO THE TOP  OF THE SOYUZ.  AS OF THIS MOMENT THEY HAVE BEEN ON BOARD FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS,  BEFORE WE CAME ON THE AIR AT  ABOUT 1:53AM, THEY WERE GETTING  READY TO GET THROUGH THE CHECK  ON THE SPACE SUITS.  THEY ARE REPORTED THAT THEY  COMPLETED THE LEAK CHECKS.  THE CREW FINISHED OFF, CLOSING  THE ADVISORS AND PRESSURIZING  THE SUITS.  WE'LL HAVE A COUPLE OF VIEWS  INSIDE THE CABIN THROUGHOUT THE  RIDE UP HILL THIS MORNING.  RIGHT NOW THE CREW, LAST TIME WE CHECKED IN, HAD THE VIZORS OPEN. WE'LL SEE THEM CLOSED BEFORE THE LAUNCH  . AS MENTIONED EARLIER, THE ROAD  TO THE LAUNCH HAS BEEN ANYTHING  BUT NORMAL. IT BEGAN WITH THE COS KNOW  NAUGHTS, ANATOLY IVANISHIN AND  IVAN VAGNER, THE BACKUP CREW,  FINDING OUT THEY WERE LAUNCHING, THAT OCCURRED A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE FINAL TRAINING EXAMS, WHICH  TURNED OUT TOTIMING. >> OF COURSE IT WAS A SURPRISE. WE THOUGHT WE'D FLY IN  OCTOBER 2020.  LIFE HAPPENS.  AND ANY BACK UP CREW IS READY TO BECOME PRIME.  AND SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS AT  BAIKONUR.  WE WERE LUCKY, WE HAD SOME TIME  FOR THE NEWS TO SETTLE IN. [ ♪♪♪ ] >> JUST LIKE MENTIONED.  THEY AND CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY  HAVE BEEN TRAINING FOR THIS  MISSION FOR A FEW YEARS, AND  THEY WERE PREPARED AND READY TO  FILL IN THE ROLES, EVEN UNDER  THE UNUSU CIRCUMSTANCES.  THERE WERE INCREASED HEALTH AND  SAFETY PRECAUTIONS PUT IN PLACE  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. THANKFULLY WE HAVE A ROBUST PLAN IN PLACE OF NOT TOO MUCH NEEDED  TO CHANGE WHAT THE CREW  THEMSELVES, BUT SOME OF THE  TRADITIONAL PRELAUNCH ACTIVITIES HAD TO BE RESTRUCTURED OR  REPLACED.  TO ENSURE TAT WE HAD A THOROUGH QUARANTINE POSITION FOR THE  CREW. >> IT'S BEEN INTERESTING, LIFE  FOR US IN THE PRELAUNCH PERIOD  IS ALWAYS IN QUARANTINE, I KNEW  I WAS GOING TO BE IN QUARANTINE  FOR THE TWO WEEKS.  WHAT IS DIFFERENT IS EVERYONE  AROUND US IS IN QUARANTINE TOO.  LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD, AND  TO SEE THE IMPACTS ON THAT IN  TERMS OF WHO FROM NASA CAN COME  OVER TO SUPPORT LAUNCH, AND EACH THE RUSSIAN OPERATION ALT  SUPPORT TEAM IS SMALLER, MY  FAMILY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COME. IT WILL BE A SKELETON CALL AT  THE  COSMODRONE, WHICH WILL BE QUITE  DIFFERENT.  [ ♪♪♪ ] >> WE ARE BACK AT THE LAUNCHPAD. YOU SEE THEANTRY ARMS PULLING  BACK.  PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE ROCKETS  ITSELF. ONE OF THE FINAL TASKS DOWN  THERE BEFORE WE ARE READY FOR  LAUNCH.  THE ROCKET THAT YOU ARE LOOKING  AT RIGHT NOW WENT THROUGH ALL  THE STANDARD PREPARATIONS  EARLIER THIS WEEK.  THE SPACECRAFT ITSELF MADE IT TO THE BOOSTER.  IT'S ALL JOINT TOGETHER.  AND ON NDAY, THE SOYU ROCKET  BEGAN A TREK TO THE LAUNCHPAD  WHERE IT WAS RAISED TO THE  VERTICAL POSITION. FINAL PREPARATIONS, THIS IS A  VIDEO ON MONDAY.  THE SOYUZ GOING OUT FIRST FROM  THE INTEGRATION FACILITY, AND  IT'S A SHORTER PATH THAN YOU  MIGHT HAVE SEEN FROM PREVIOUS  LAUNCHES THAT WENT FROM PATH  NO.1, WE ARE USING PATH 31 THIS  TIME FROM THE FIRST TIME THE  CREW PUT IN THE CHANGE.  KIMBROUGH LAUNCHING IN  OCTOBER 2016.  ALL THIS BECAUSE WE ARE OTHE  BOOSTER.  UPGRADED VERSION OF THE SOYUZ  ROCKET.  USED TO CARRY CREW MEMBERS INTO  SPACE FOR OVER 50 YEARS.  THE SOYUZ SITTING HIGH ABOVE THE THREE STAGES OF THE BOOSTER,  WHICH USES KEROSENE.  HIGHLY REFIN VERSION OF  KEROSENE, REFERRED TO ASSESS  ROCKET FUEL.  AND LIQUID OXY ZEN AS THE PROPEL ABLE TO.  THE FIRST STAGE HAS FOUR LIQUID  ENGINES.  THE FIRST STAGES ITSELF HAS FOUR LIQUID ENGINES STRAPPED TO THE  SIDE OF THE CORE VEHICLE, EACH  ONE OF THOSE WILL BURN FOR ABOUT 1:58 SECONDS BEFORE THEY DROP  AWAY. >> AND THE CORE ENGINE ITSELF  SERVES AS THE SECOND STAGE.  WE'LL SEE THAT BURN UNTIL 4:37  INTO THE FL.  AND THE THIRD STAGE HAS SINGLE ENGINE, WE'LL SEE IT IGNITE  BEFORE IT SEPARATES FROM THE  SECOND PHASE, THEY DO SOMETHING  CALLED HOT PHASING, THERE'S A  LATTICE WORK STRUCTURE BETWEEN  THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES  ALLOWING THE EXHAUST TO EXPAND  OUT.  ATTACH TO THE SECOND STAGE, THE  THIRD STAGE WILLPO PUSH IT AWAY SALE.  THAT WILL BURN UNTIL 8:46 INTO  THE FLIGHT.  AT THAT POINT THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT WILL SEPARATE FROM  THE THIRD STAGE, AND IT WILL BE  IN THE PRELIMINARY ORBIT. AS MENTIONED AT THE START OF THE SHOW, WE SAID WE'D GET TO YOUR  QUESTIONS, WE'LL GO THROUGH SOME NOW.  IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE  LAUNCH, DOCKING OR HATCH  OPENING.  SEND IT IN ON TWITTER USING  HASHTAG-NASA.  THIS ONE, AT WHAT TIME AFTER THE LAUNCH WILL THE LCH BE  EJECTED. >> IT'S 1:54 SECONDS INTO THE  FLIGHT.  THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PIECE OF THE LAUNCH SYSTEM.  THERE ARE SOLID ROCKET MOTORS ON THE CAPSULE BEARING ITSELF, THAT CAN BE USED AFTER THE TOURS  JETTISON.  JUST DON'T PULL THE VEHICLE AW.  THEY WERE USED ON OCTOBER 11TH,  WHEN THE M.S.U. SPACE GRAFT  QUARRYING OLEXY AND ANOTHEREN  COUNTERED A LAUNCH ESCAPE.  1:54 SECOND, TO ANSWER YOUR  QUESTION. >> THE NEXT ONE COMES FROM SI,  WANTING TO KNOW IF THE STATION CREW GET TO EP THEIR PHONES ON THE I.S.S. THEY DON'T BRING THE PHONE WITH  THEM.  YOUR CELL PHONE RELIES ON GROUND STATION TOWERS TO COMMUNICATE.  THEY ARE A LITTLE TOO HIGH UP  FOR THOSE TO WORK.  THEY DO HAVE, BASICALLY, VOICE  OVER IP PHONES, SO A PHONE THAT  USES DATA, USING THE DATA  STREAMS THATEND TELEMETRY  DATA, VIDEO, EVERYTHING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, AND ARE ABLE TO CALL PEOPLE FROM  EARTH.  IT WORKS LIKE VOICE OVER IP.  AND THEY CAN DIAL CELL PHONE  NUMBERS HERE ON EARTH, AND THEY  CAN CALL YOU FROM SPACE. AND WE WILL GET TO A LITTLE BIT  MORE A LITTLE LATER IN TODAY'S  LAUNCH.  FOR NOW, LET'S KEEP ON GOING  THROUGH.  LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT WHICH WE WILL SEE IN  SPACE WHEN IT ARRIVES AT THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACEATION.  GOING THROUGH QUICK FACTS.  SOYUZ 23.5 FEET LONG, WEIGHING  IN 15,615 POUNDS, COMPRISED OF  THREE DIFFERENT MODULES. THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS THE  DESCENT MODULE.  CONTAINING THE SEATS CONTROLS  AND SPLAYS NECESSARY FOR THE --  DISPLACE NECES FORHE  FLIGHT SHOULD THE CREW TAKE  CONTROL AND FLY. GIVING YOU IN TIGHT INTO THE  SYSTEMS ON THE SPACECRAFT AND  THE ROCKET.  AND ALL THE LIFE SUPPORT  SYSTEMS, BATSRIES FOR  RE-ENTRY -- BATTERIES FOR  RE-ENTRY AND LANDING, AND USED  TO SLOW THE SOYUZ BEFORE TOUCH  DOWN, WHEN THEY LAND IN  KAZAKHSTAN.  THE MODULE WEIGHS 6,393 POUNDS.  AND CAN CARRY 110 POUNDS OF  PAYLOAD RETURNED DOWN TO EARTH  WITH THE MODULE. BRINGING YOU DOWN SAMPLES,  THINGS LIKE THAT WITH THE CREW  WHEN THEY RETURN, AND THAT IS  MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ONLY  PORTION OF THE SOYUZ THAT HAS  HEAT SHIELDS, SO IT'S ABLE TO  SURVIVE THE FIERY RE-ENTRY  THROUGHRTH'S ATMOSPHERE.  THE ORBITAL MODULES ON TOP  CONNECTING TO THE DISSENT  MODULE.  THERE'S A HATCHWAY BETWEEN IF  AND THE DISSENT MODULE.  IT HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF ROOM  INSIDE THAT THEY CAN MOVE  AROUND. ON THE TOP IT HAS THE DOCKING  MECHANISM.  THE HATCH AND RENDEZVOUS  ANTENNAS. AND THERE'S A FORWARD-LOOKING  WIND THAT THEY SCAN LOOK OUT.  THEY TAKE MANUAL MEASUREMENTS AS AN APPROACH TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THEY CAN USE A LASER RANGE  FINDER IN THE EVENT THEY HAVE  ISSUES.  ON THE BOTTOM IS THE PROPULSION  OF THE IMPLEMENTATION MODULE.  IT HAS OXYGEN TANKS,  COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL  EQUIPMENT PROPULSION PORTION OF  THE MODULE HANDLES ALL THE  ORBITAL MANOEUVRES, IT HAS  ENGINES NEEDED FOR THE  RENDEZVOUS AT THE SPACE STATION, AND A BURN AT THE ENDS OF THE  MISSION.  BEFORE THEY ARE DEPLOYED.  THERE ARE TWO SOLAR ARRAYS  GIVING A WIND SPAN OF 35 FEET.  THEY ARE FOLDED AGAINST THE BODY OF THE MODULE. ONCE WE GET INTO SPACE, WE'LL  SEE THEM UNFURL AND PROVIDE  ELECTRO POWER TO THE STATION'S  SYSTEMS. BOTH THE PROPULSION MODULE AND  THE ORBITAL MODULE SEPARATE FROM THE DISSENT IMMEDIATUAL AT THE  END OF A MISSION AND ONE UP IN  THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.  THE SPACECRAFT SEARCHING AS A  TRANSPORT VEHICLE TO AND FROM  THE SPACE STATION AND ACTS AS AN EMERGENCY RETURN VEHICLE, SHOULD THE CREW NEED TO LEAVE  UNEXPECTEDLY.  FOR EVERY CREW MEMBER ON BOARD  THERE'S A SEAT IN A SPACECRAFT  FOR THEM DOCKED TO THE SPACE  STATION. >> JUST CHECKING IN, WE ARE  22:20 SECONDS TO THE LAUNCH.  THE CREW CONDUCTED SUIT LEAK  CHECKS.  THEY ARE STANDING BY AT THIS  POINT UNTIL WE GET TO THE LAUNCH POINT.  CREW GOING THROUGH ALLE  PRELAUNCH PROCEDURES INSIDE THE  CAPSULE, STILL CONTINUING ON  WITH THIS COUNTDOWN FOR TODAY. ONCE THEY LEAVE THE EARTH'S  ATMOSPHERE, A LITTLE LATER THIS  MORNING, THIS IS GOING TO BET  THIRD TRIP INTO SPACE FOR NASA'S CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY.  AND BEFORE HEADING BACK INTO  ORBIT.  HE SPENT A MOMENT SHARING WITH US THE SPECIAL PERSPECTIVE THAT  HE'S BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, THE PLACE THAT HE'S SOON GOING TO  CALL HOME ONCE AGAIN. [ ♪♪♪ ] >> THE SPACE STATION IS BIGGER  THAN YOU THINK.  WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE YOU ARE  GOING LIVE IN THE SPACE STATION  PEOPLE THING OF CRAMPED PLACES,  CRAMPED SDERS WHEN YOUALK  THROUGH. IT'S BIG, AND YOU CAN STAND AND  IN A WHOLE DAY NEVER SEE A CREW  MATE.  THE OTHER THING PEOPLE DON'T  REALIZE IS THE MACHINE, JUST  LIKE YOUR CAR OR HOUSE. OR YOUR AIRCONDITIONER IS GOING  TO BREAK.  THEY MEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN NASA  HAS SOMETHING THAT WILL BREAK IN SPACISM IT'S A MACHINE, IT WILL  BREAK, THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO  DO, KEEP IT RUNNING. END OF THE DAY, THERE'S SEVERAL  THINGS THAT REQUIRES A PERSON TO TURN AROUND. ON MY FIRST MISSION, I WAS A  SHUTTLE CREW MEMBER, MY SECOND  MISSION T WE ARE PUSHING THE  SCIENCE SYSTEMS OF THE SPACE  STATION, AND GETTING THE MOST  OUT OF THE ALL OF THE ASSETS  THAT THE SPACE STATION HAS TO  GIVE FOR SCIENCE AND RESEARCH,  NOW WE ARE HUMMING ALONGITH  THE SCIENCE AND RESEARCH.  THE GREATER COMMUNITY KNOWS HOW  TO RUN THE SPACE STATION SO WE  CAN DEVOTE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ASTRONAUTS TO SCIENCE. THE ANNIVERSARY IS SPECIAL TO ME IN THE SENSE THAT BILL SHEPHERD  WAS THE COMMANDER OF EXPEDITION  1, UNITED STATES NAVY SEAL. AND I'LL BE THE COMMANDER OF  EXPEDITION 63, 20 YEARS LATER.  UNITED STATES NAVY SEAL. SO THERE HAS BEEN THREE OF US  SHEP, MYSELF AND JOHNNY, WHO  HAVE COME FROM THE SEAL  COMMANDERS.   I THINK IT'S COOL THAT IT'S THE BOOKENDS OF THE 20 YEARS OF  STATIONS IS COMMANDED BY SHEP  AND MYSELF. WHAT AM I LOOKING FORWARD TO  MOST ON THIS MISSION? THIS IS M THIRD ONE. I'M GOING INTO IT WITH THE  MINDSET I'LL CHERISH EVERY DAY  I'M THERE, IT MAY BE THE LAST  DAY I GET TO LOOK OUT THE WIND  AND SEE EARTH. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO  APPRECIATING EVERY ONE OF  THOSE DAYS. I'LL BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO  EARTH TO BE WITH MY FAMILY, BUT  I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO  THAT, EACF THOSE DAYS.  I'M ASTRONAUT CHRISTOPHER  CASSIDY, THANKS FOR BEING PART  OF EXPEDITION 63. >> BACK NOW WITH A LIVE VIEW OF  THE SOYUZ ROCKET.  REITERATING THE FINAL SCENE  THERE, IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW  SCPRIS HIS MISSION, HE'S --  CHRIS AND HIS MISSION, HE'S  SPENDING SIX MONTHS, FOLLOW HIM  AT INSTAGRAM, HE'S AT  ASTRO-_SEAL.  A QUICK CHECK IN.  WE ARE 17:40 SECONDS AWAY FROM  THE LAUNCH. TAKE A COUPLE MORE MINUTES NOW,  AND ANSWER A FEW MORE OF YOUR  ASK NASA QUESTIONS.  IF YOU HAVE ANY USE THE HASHTAG  ASK NASA, SEND IN AND WE'LL GO  THROUGH THEM. WE HAVE ONE FROM ANDREW BORDER  WHO ASKS A QUESTION ABOUT THE TRAINING THEY'VE GONE THROUGH,  HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN WAITING  FOR THIS DAY.  AND HOW MUCH THRUST HAS THE  ROCKET LET OUT.  CREWS FOR THE SPACE STATION  TRAIN FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS,  THAT'S TO GET FAMILIARISATION ON ALL OF THE SYSTEMS ON BOARD THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION,  THAT THEY'LL INTERACT WITH,  FIXING IT, WORKING ON  EXPERIMENTS, THEY ARE DOING  SPACE WALKS, THERE'S A LOT OF  KNOWLEDGE TO GATHER AND TRAIN,  AND IT TAKES TWO YEARS TO DO  THAT.  THEY ARE GOING THROUGH  SPACECRAFT SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR THE CREWS, THEY HAD TO TRAIN ON  THE SOYUZ SYSTEMS, BE ABLE TO  RESPOND IN THE EVENT OF AN  EMERGENCY, FLY THE VEHICLE IF  YOU ARE THE COMMANDER OR THE  BACK UP.  AND THEY DO FINAL EXAMS,T'S  LIKE TO COLLEGE FOR A LOT OF THE CREW MEMBERS, IT'S  ABOUT TWO YEARS OF TRAINING, AND HOW MUCH THRUST DOES THE ROCKET  LET OUT IN THE FIRST STAGE,  DELIVERS ABOUT 930,000 POUNDS OF THRUST. [ ♪♪♪ ] >> AND THEN THE NEXT ONE COMES  FROM ROBERT GRUZMAN, ARRIVING  WHEN THE ASTRONAUTS COME BACK TO EARTH IS THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM  WEAKENED BY A STAY IN SPACE. IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION AND IT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE A  LOT OF STUDIES TAKING PLACE.  THE HUMAN BODY ADAPTS QUICKLY TO NEW ENVIRONMENTS, IT'S A  BLESSING AND A CURSE FOR STUFF  LIKE SPACE FLIGHT.  STARTS TO AFFECT A LOT OF THINGS LIKE PHONES, MUSCLES AND IMMUNE  SYSTEMS IN THE ASTRONAUTS.  WE SEE THAT IT CAN AFFECT YOUR  IMMUNE SYSTEM.  IT CAN WEAKEN YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM A LITTLE BIT.  AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY  THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO  UNDERSTAND AS WE LOOK TO NOT  ONLY SEND HUMANS FURTHER THAN WE HAVE EVER GONE BEFORE, GOING  FORWARD TO THE MOON AND  EVENTUALLY ON TO MARS, TO  KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.  WHEN THEY ARE IN SPACE, BUT ALSO VERY IMPORTANTLY, WHEN THEY COME HOME.  WE HAVE FOUND THAT A LOT OF  STUFF THAT HAPPENS TO YOUR BODY  WHEN YOU ARE ON THE SPACE  STATION HAS A LOT OF PARALLELS  FOR AILMENTS HERE ON EARTH.  A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BODY, LIKE BONE WASTING AND MUSCLE LOSS AND THING OF THAT NATURE. MIMIC A LOT OF THE EFFECTS OF  AGEING, SO WE ARE ABLE TO USE  THE ASTRONAUTS, AND WHILE WE ARE TRYING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM WHILE THEY ARE  IN OUTER SPACE, HOW TO GUEST  TAKE CARE OF THEM, A LOT OF  THOSE LESSONS CAN TRANSLATE TO  MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR HUMANS ON THE GROUND.  WE ARE GOING TO KEEP MOVING ON.  SEND THE QUESTIONS IN, WE'LL DO  A LUNCH LATER TODAY WHEN WE GET  TO THE DOCKING SHOW.  USE THE HASHTAG ASK NASA.  AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT A COUPLE  OF TIMES, SPACE FLIGHT ALL ABOUT TRADITIONS, IN KEEPING WITH  THAT, EVERY MISSION, LIKE EVERY  NASA PROGRAMME, EVERY CREW, HAS GIVE THEIR OWN PATCH WITH THE  UNIQUE DESIGN THAT HELPS TO  COMMEMORATE THEIR MISSION AND  CREW MEMBERS, AND THIS IS A LOOK AT THE EXPEDITION 63 PATCH.  IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF MIF  FAVOURITES.  IT'S COOL INTERESTING LOOKING  ONE, AN INTERSECTION OF A NEW  DAWN AND SPACEIGHT.  WE CONTINUE TO STAY ON BOARD THE STATION, WE ARE ABOUT TO  COMMEMORATE 20 YEARS OF  CONTINUOUS FLIGHT.  BUT LOOK AT PUTTING HUMANS ONCE  MORE ON THE MOON, AND GETTING  READY TO NOT TOO FAR AFTER, HEAD ON TO MARS.  13 OF THE STARS IN THE PATCH  COMMEMORATE THE APOLLO 13th. CELEBRATING A 50th ANNIVERSARY  DURING EXPEDITION 63.  AND THE PUSH, TEACHER MISSION  THAT WILL GO BEYOND LOW EARTH  ORBIT AGAIN.  AND THE CREW CALL SIGN ORBITING  AROUND A NUKE LEE US, IN THEIR  CASE PLANET EARTH.  AND ANO TRADITI THAT THE  ASTRONAUTS AND COSMONAUTS LIKE  TO TAKE PART THIS IS A 0-G  INDICATOR, WE'LL SEE IT FLOATING ABOVE THE SECOND SEAT.  SOMETIMES EACH CREW MEMBER HAS  THEIR OWN.  TOLY IS TAKE BS -- ANATOLY  ANA  IVANISHIN IS TAKING A TOY, A  SIGNIFICANT GIFT FOR HIS GLAIND  ONE DAY.  THAT WILL HANG INSIDE THE SOYUZ  CAPSULE WHEN WE GET THE IN-CABIN VIEWS, IT'S A 0-G INDICATOR, AND WE USE IT WHEN YOU START TO SEE  THAT FLOAT, AND THAT HAPPENS  AFTER THEY GET TO THE THIRD  STAGE, THEY ARE EXPOSED TO  MICROGRAVITY, THEMSELVES,  STRAPPED INTO THE SEATS, THEY'LL NOT BE FLOATING AROUND JUST YET. ANOTHER SYSTEM COLLECT IN, WE  ARE NOT TRACKING ANY ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE, WE  12:25  COUNTING AWAY FROM    ALL RIGHT.  WE ARE GETTING CLOSER, 11.5 AWAY FROM LAUNCH, ALL TOLD. IT WILL BE UNDER A 9 MINUTE RIDE TO ORBIT FOR THE CREW.  THEY'LL BE LAUNCHING AT  3:05:00a.m. CENTRAL TIME  4:05a.m. EASTERN.  WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR A NUMBER OF MILESTONES THE RIDE UPHILL.  ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR ONES IS  THE LAUNCH ESCAPE SYSTEM  JETTISON, COMING 1:54 INTO THE  FLIGHT.  THE FIRST STAGE CUTS OFF AND  SEPARATES THE FOUR STRAP-ON  LIQUID FUEL BOOSTERS AT 1:58.  AFTER THAT IS IT DOWN, THE  LH ROUTE, THE AREA ON TOP,  PROTECTING THE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT  FROM AERODYNAMIC FORCES ON THE  RIGHT SEPARATES AT 2:33 SECONDS  INTO FLIGHT.  THE SECOND STAGE WILL SHUT DOWN  AT 4:37 SECONDS.  SEPARATING AT 4:48 SECONDS AS  THAT HAPPENS, THE THIRD STAGE WILL FIRING, DOING A HOT  FIRE TECHNIQUE, AND WE GET A  CLOSE UP AND YOU SEE THE LATTICE WORK-LIKE STRUCTURE BETWEEN THE  SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF THE  SOYUZ SPACECRAFT.  ALLOWING THE ENGINE TO FIRE  WHILE THEY ARE ATTACHED.  THE THIRD STAGE COMING AT 4:56.  AND THE FINAL THING THE'LL  LOOK FORS GOING TO BE THE  THIRD STAGE SHUTDOWN. >> LAUNCH LEAD.

THIS, AGAIN, MOMENTS AGO, AFTER  THEY LIFTED OFF.  IT'S BEEN ALMOST 20 MINUTES  E LIFT OFF.  ANATOLY IVANISHIN, THE SOEZ  COMMANDER IN THE CENTER CEAT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.  IVAN VAGNER MAKING A FIRST RIDE  INTO ORBIT. AT THE TIME OF THE REPLAY THEY  WERE UNDER THE FULL POWER OF THE SOYUZ FIRST STAGE.  AND YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW SMOOTH  THE RIDE IS UPHILL FOR THE CREW   INSIDE.  GAIN, JUST OUT OF THE VIEW --  AGAIN, JUST OUT OF THE VIEW NASA ASTRONAUT CHRISTOPHER CASSIDY IN SPACE FOR THE   IF YOU ARE JOINING US, THIS IS  VIDEO OF MINUTES AGO WHEN THEY  LAUNCHED.  THE LAUNCH TH CAME 21:20 SECONDS AGO. IT'S THE IN-IN VIEW LOOKING AT  ANATOLY IVANISHIN LEFT CORNER.  BIG SMILE ON THE FACE MAKING A  FIRST RIDE UP HILL INTO OUTER  SPACE TODAY M RIGHT NOW THE CREW IS INSIDE THE SOYUZ CAPSULE.  PERFORMING THE ON-ORBIT  CHECKOUTS.  AT THIS POINTS THEY'VE BEEN  GIVEN THE GO TO OPEN UP THEIR  VISORS OR THEIR SUITS.  AND GETTING REMINDERS TO  DEACTIVATE THERMAL SES ON  THELF, AND GETTING  READY TO DEACTIVATE THE PROBE  AND GOING A HAND CONTROLLER  TEST.  ABLE TO CONTROL THE SOYUZ  SPACECRAFT ITSELF. IF WE GO FOR THE NOMINAL PLAN  EVERYTHING WILL BE DONE  AUTOMATED. RENDEZVOUS AND DOCKING SYSTEM.  THAT WAS CONFIRMED TO HAVE  SEPARATED FROM THE SOYUZ ROCKET, ALONG WITH THE SOLAR ARRAYS. STANDING BY FOR A FEW MOMENTS  FOR THE LAUNCH REPLAY, WE SHOULD BE BRINGING THEM TO YOU SHORTLY. AND HERE WE GO, SHE IS ARE  REPLAYS -- THESE ARE REPLAY, THE LAUNCH ON TIME 3:05 CENTRAL.  4:05:00 EASTERN.  SOYUZ M.S.-16 SPACE -- SOYUZ  MS-16 TAKING OFF.  THE REPLAYS WILL CYCLE THROUGH A FEW DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE  ROCKET   >> AND ANOTHER REPLAY, WE'LL  STAND BY, WE SHOULD HAVE AT  LEAST ONE MORE REPLAY OF THE  LAUNCH, COMING ON TIME AT  3:05a.m. CENTRAL. 25 MINUTES AGO.  STAND BY.  WE GET CONFIRMATION OF THE  DOCKING PROBE.  SO THAT EXTENDS FROM THE VERY  TOP OF THE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT OUT  OF THE ORBITAL MODULE.  USED TO DO THE FINAL ALIGNMENT  INTO THE DOCKING COMPARTMENT ON  THE POLICE MODULE WHERE THEY'LL  BE HEADED TODAY. THAT WAS EXTENDED SUCCESSFULLY  FOR ALL THE HONORARY CHECKOUTS  CONTINUING TO GO PER PLAN.  AND SHOULD BE INNED 20 MINUTES  AWAY -- BE UNDER 20 MINUTES AWAY FROM ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR  FIRINGS OF THE ENGINE, ON THE  IMPLEMENTATION MODULE.  KNOWN AS THE NO.1 BURN.  AND THAT WILL BE THE FIRST IN A  SERIES OF FIRINGS THAT GRADULY SE THE SOYUZ'S ORBIT UNTIL  IT'S ON THE SAME LEVEL OF THE  SPACE STATION. AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 257 STATUTE MILES. HERE WE GO, ONE MORE LAUNCH  REPLAY FROM JUST ABOUT   26 MINUTES AGO.  SOYUZ LAUNCH - LOOKED LIKE A  PERFECT LAUNCH, AND EVERYWHERE - WE HAVE A  . ALL RIGHT.  THAT WILL DO IT FORUR REPLAYS 
  WHILE WE GO INTO THE THIRD ONE,  WE HAD A CALL FROM THE  INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION,  ANDREW MORGAN, A CURRENTS  RESIDENT.  REPORTED THAT THEY WATCHED THE  LAUNCH, AND WITH EVERYTHING  LOOKING GOOD THEY ARE READY TO  RECEIVE THE CREW MEMBERS, AND  MENTIONED HE'LL HAVE DINNER  WAITING FOR THEM.  HE AND JESSICA MEIR AND OLEG  SKRIPOCHKA COMING OUT OF THE  SLEEP PERIOD.  THIS IS BRIGHT AND EARLY IN THE  MORNING FOR THEM.  IN SIX HOURS FROM NOW THEY'LL  HAVE THREE NEW CREW MEMBERS THAT THEY'LL WELCOME ON BOARD. WITH THAT, WE'LL TAKE A BREAK  FOR NOW.  WHILE THE SOYUZ FINE  TUPS  ITS -- FINE TUNE ITS PATH. WE'LL BE BACK FOR LIVE COVERAGE  ONCE WE ARE HERE AND READY FOR  DOCKING, ON NASSA TV WE'LL --  NASA TV WE'LL DO A VIDEO FILE. ALL THE LAUNCH, AND BE BACK WITH THE LIVE COVERAGE AT 8:30AM  CENTRAL.  9:30 STERN.  OR A PLANNED DOCKING AT 9:16AM. AFTER A DOCKS, A SERIES OF  CHECKS, AND READY TO OPEN THE  HATCHES AND MOVE INTO THE  STATION, WE'LL BEGIN AT 11AM  CENTRAL.  HATCH OPENING AROUND 11:30a.m..  AND WRAP UP THE COVERAGE WITH A  VIDEO FILE SHOWING ALL OF THE  HIGHLIGHTS FROM DING,ND THE HATCH OPENING AT 2:00p.m.  CENTRAL.  3:00p.m. EASTERN.  SO BE SURE TO TUNE BACK IN THEN. KEEP SENDING THE QUESTIONS USING THE HASHTAG ASK NASA ON TWITTER, WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO  ANSWER THOSE AS WE MOVE THROUGH  THE DOCKING AND HATCH OPENING  LATER THIS MORNING.  I DO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR  STNG UP LATE OR WAKING UP  EARLY TO TUNE IN TO WATCH THE  LAUNCH.  IT'S A ROUGH TIME FOR  EVERYWHERE, WE APPRECIATE IT.  WITH THAT WE'LL SIGN OFF AND BE  BACK IN A FEW HOURS, THIS IS  MISSION CONTROL HOUSTON.  d
bad luck from the very
beginning. 13, we have one more item for
you when you get a chance - we'd
like you to stir up your
