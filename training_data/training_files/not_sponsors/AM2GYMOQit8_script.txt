Hey so I get it I totally get it you're a millennial and you have a habit of buying smashed avocado toast and it is absolutely ruining your chances of ever buying a house so you've gone to the dark side you may have even Google search clinical trials in your area we've all done it or or you may even have considered selling kidney on the black market we've all done it so or at the point of you wondering what organs you can sell off and I'm presuming that you already know that you only need one kidney as your other one actually even gets bigger when you take the other one out but did you know that your stomach is also pretty useless too I mean it's not completely useless the bean shaped sack secretes hydrochloric acids and enzymes that break down the food so it can continue on its journey throughout the justice system and a secrete acid and enzyme system of muscles contract to mix it all together the acid also works to kill harmful microbes that may have made their way into your body with them avocados the acid has the potential of course to damage the stomach so it also secretes a neutralizing mucus that coats the lining of the stomach and this protects it from damage the stomach also makes a substance that is necessary for the body to absorb it maybe twelve and of course it can also store food I can hold over a liter the mushy stuff so that sounds like a lot of sponsor abilities for a little bean so how can we live without it well well well well the whole stomach can be removed and this happens quite frequently for those who have stomach cancer and other conditions such as like all tourism I have part of their stomach removed and this is a procedure known as a total gastrectomy and in this procedure the small intestine is connected directly to the esophagus so that everything you eat goes straight down into your small intestine those who have had a total gastrectomy have to have nutrition through a vein through qpn while they recover from surgery before they can start eating again and when they can eat again the advice is to eat little and often as you can't store food like you used to and also the small intestine struggle stubs or vitamin b12 by itself so regular injections of b12 are normally required but we have all a story nobody wants to buy our little bean sack because I don't really need one either so I want to 200 people will get 20% off an annual premium subscription to boot thank you for watching bye
