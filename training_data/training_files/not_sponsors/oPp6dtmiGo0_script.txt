hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with cloud eggs that's right you've probably seen these things blowing up on
social media recently and by recently I mean like two years ago
but anyway I finally got around to shooting a video for these and I'm glad
I did right these things are very easy to do
and a lot of fun to make and of course super cool to look at
Plus as much as I hate to admit it since this really is a gimmick very very
enjoyable tease so with that let's go ahead and get started by separating a
couple large eggs which I like to do by cracking the egg into a clean hand and
then carefully letting the white strip between my fingers into a bowl at which
point we'll reserve the oken a separate and much smaller bowl and a lot of
people get nervous about doing this step which in the business we refer to as
separation anxiety but this hand method is very easy and works almost every time
and yes I've seen the suck the yolk out with the empty water bottle trick and
I'm not impressed yes it looks cool and can google that if want but this
works just as good and is easier and then what we'll do once those have been
separated has add a few drops of vinegar to our whites and I use champagne
vinegar but literally anything will work and it will also add a pinch of salt and
then we will take a whisk the biggest and most bulbous one we have and we will
whip these egg whites until we have relatively firm but not dry peaks okay
the most common mistake with these is over whipping the whites and by the way
do not use an electric mixer for these all right two egg whites is only gonna
take a couple minutes to whisk up and if use the electric mixer they won't
have any soul but anyway like I said we're gonna go ahead and whisk these
until we have Peaks that will hold their shape but are still a little bit soft
and very luxurious and if everything goes according to plan they should look
exactly like this alright not to brag but those are perfect and then what
we'll do once those have been meringue just go ahead and take a spoon and form
our two clouds on a lightly buttered Silpat lined baking sheet and of course
the exact size and shape of the clouds are up to although I do strongly
recommend going with the cumulus okay you're gonna want to avoid the Stratus
and under no circumstances should attempt a Cirrus
and one tip here try not to make these too wide okay we really do want these to
have some nice height I mean now like cumulonimbus height but a little bit of
verticality is nice and as we finished shaping these we're gonna want to form a
little depression in the top in which we will place our yoke later and that's it
once we finish making our happy little clouds well go ahead and transfer those
into the center of a 375 degree oven for about five minutes or so or until they
start taking on just a little tiny bit of color okay we do not want to overcook
these otherwise they're gonna get tough and dry plus they're gonna cook a little
more once we add our yolks which is the next step and if you're not sure your
wells are deep enough keep press it down a little bit with a spoon like I
did here even though that was probably unnecessary but either way we'll go
ahead and carefully transfer our yolks in at which point we'll pop these back
in the oven for another three minutes or so or until that yolk is just barely
heated through and that surface sort of starts to glaze over and look a little
bit glassy but and most importantly they're still running okay if you're not
gonna make these with runny yolks please don't make them and that's it
we'll go ahead and transfer our cloud egg onto a piece of generously buttered
toast and I finish mine up with a little shake of cayenne plus a little too big
of a pinch of coarse sea salt okay I forgot to put a generous pinch in the
whites so be careful with the salt and that's it my cloud egg was done and we
are ready for the money shot in three two one oh yeah and if enjoy a piece
of butter toast dipped into a runny yolk egg were gonna absolutely love this
and what makes it such an enjoyable / bizarre experience is that the yolk and
the toast elements are totally normal and yet you're enjoying them alongside
this puffed up airy egg meringue so yes it's quite unusual but happily still
very delicious and extremely enjoyable and of course if wanted to dress
this up with some fresh herbs like some chives or tarragon or dill that would
not be a bad idea or could do some kind of Eggs Benedict presentation and
serve this on top of an English muffin and Canadian bacon in which case we'd
probably use a little bit of lemon juice instead of vinegar in the egg whites but
anyway those kind of variations are up to you
I mean guys after all the pegs of your cloud eggs which reminds me my
mother-in-law's name is Peggy and I'm thinking this would make a pretty cool
menu item for a Mother's Day brunch okay social distancing notwithstanding
but anyway no matter what the occasion our official food wishes forecast calls
for a chance of clouds with a little bit of Sun peeking through which is why I
really do hope give this a try soon so please follow the links below for the
ingredient amounts a principle written recipe and much more info as usual and
