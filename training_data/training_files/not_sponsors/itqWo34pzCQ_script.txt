artists are some of the most underappreciated and abused and abused individuals in the YouTube community they make our content look more professional they work on our branding they make fan art for free just as their way to participate in the community and we want to say thank you for that today before we can offer any March someone needs to design it now the devil wanted to design our March and I've got a few ideas for what I think would look cool on a shirt but I knew we'd be better off hiring artists to make sure that this looks good I was the first artist okay look at this shirt I made this in the 70s for a friend's band look at how that plays in the light this was a limited edition right okay you know much glitter we went through to make these nobody's glittering anymore nobody nobody does glitter shirts I did this without Photoshop [Music] our goal is to make some cool graphic tees for our merch line and we're now at the step where we need to gather the art this is episode 2 in our trihard series about how to make March and today we're focusing on commissioning art last time we talked about merch and fashion lines created by youtubers and we determined what made good merch special and what made bad merch awful having original artwork is a must and stealing google images is offensive before I'd ever hired a freelance artist I had some questions where do I find an artist how much is that gonna cost what if they make something I don't like can I ask for changing will I owe them a percentage of every sale forever or can I just buy the art outright will answer all those questions and then I'll tell you about the artists we hired and show you what they made us all of them told me that they may be willing to work on your projects to all of their contact information is in the description below of course these artists might get too busy or maybe you're just looking for a different style so let's back it up a step and talk about how to find artists Elvis the alien who we discovered make some of the best parts available alien clothing told me that he found his primary artist from a contest he started on design contest calm kind of a funny story I started alien through freelancer.com I was like I have this amount of money whoever can draw me something that I think kind of matches what I have in my head then then yeah I'll choose you and out of like 20 people Adriel like hit it right on the nose he created a t hawk parasite Tommy ten tongues choking in fact he helped me create the entire first set of alien clothing the way that these contests work on sites like design contest and freelancer comm and other similar sites is that you create a guaranteed prize and the designers upload their submissions until you pick a winner you can pick first second and third place but only the winner gets the money you do get the option to contact any runners-up and negotiate with them to buy their designs to for an additional cost obviously the bigger you make the prize the more designers will throw their hats in the ring both of the sites i mentioned suggest making a prize between two and in $600 the big upside to running a contest is that you'll get to see a lot of different options for one price those sites are pretty cool but that's not how we did ours at least for our first round of designs I wanted to have more of a direct impact on who submitted art so I spent the past couple years scouting freelance artists on Twitter twitter has a large artists community including comic book artists character designers for video games painters custom fetish artists just about any kind of artist that you can imagine unfortunately for our purposes not every artist on Twitter's for hire if their DMS are open it doesn't hurt to ask but there is a way at a glance to find out who's looking for clients we want to find the phrase Commission's open now if you see that in their bio or a commission sheet as their pin tweet well that's an invitation to offer them a deal whenever someone's art caught my eye and their profile mentioned commission art I added them to a list Twitter has this very useful feature where you can organize profiles into a custom list the big list I made is called commissioned artists you're welcome to look through it and I link that in the description below out of this big list I contacted 22 artists and offered them the job 13 of them took the job now most of our Commission's went great and I have a lot of recommendations to make some of those transactions did not go well at all now when we explain who those artists work please don't send them any hates you might even have a positive experience with them just take ours as a single bad review our perspective is the clients perspective so to be fair I asked our recommended artists after the gig was complete what makes their dream clients what makes the nightmare clients and their answers provide a lot of insight about the do's and don'ts one of the things that many of our artists mentioned is that a dream client should be a fan of their work so don't hire an artist if you're not really a fan of the choices that they usually make if you are unsure about them and you hire them well you might get lucky and you might not and that's not really gonna be their fault I know that I've looked over some portfolios and tried to talk myself into the artist you know tried to tell myself that they could make something that there's no evidence they've ever done before don't do that look over there recent work and make sure that your I don't know at least 90 percent convinced that they can make what you want the next step is briefing the artist a client should explain what they need help with exactly and pitch their ideas in a way that'll get the artist excited to start according to our survey the most important factor to being the dream client and not the nightmare client is clarity makes sense when you think about it an artist needs to take an idea out of your brain and then make it a reality so in order to help them succeed at that decide what you want beforehand and describe it as precisely as possible visual examples are a big help vague requests on the other hand lead to being a nightmare client words mean different things to different people for example if you say I want this design to feel 80s well the designer might be thinking paramedic for ATS and you're thinking New Wave aesthetic so add as much clarity as possible to avoid unpredictable results we talked it over and decided on four subjects for t-shirts the death mask from trihard dr. downvote asked the devil and niki as a heavy-metal succubus at this step you're gonna write up your job specs and then create an album with some example pictures one of the artists we hired nine explained our another good way to show an artist like him you're looking for I sent out an initial contact to our artists that read like this if the artist wrote back interested I sent out a reply with more information that look like this now you'll notice that I'm being clear upfront that this art is for channel March our intention is to put this stuff on products we'll be sold the best thing to do is to send over a release that makes that permission perfectly clear at this point an artist would typically quote their rate or else I would ask them how much would you like to be paid for this rates will always differ between artists and there's a lot of reasons that can justify that some art styles just take longer to complete some artists already have a lot of demands on their time so they charge more if I was happy with the work I usually tip on top of their asking price tipping is common in Commission art although not expected it's also very important to set a time frame for the job because open-ended jobs will stretch on forever whenever the artists ask me when do you need this done I usually said 20 days it's over complicated and not necessary to offer royalties so when do you pay an artist do you pay everything upfront do you pay in stages as the job is completed or do you only pay at the end when it's totally done some artists they'll want prepayment and it's understandable if they've been burned in the past but it should be avoided as a general rule of thumb for all contract work if you prepay for services you remove the incentive for them to finish the job and then you got to count on some other motivation to get it done that could be their reputation it could be karma here it could be the Golden Rule psychologically it's less effective you lose your leverage as the client in fairness I have a better collection department than most but if you were to pay a guy before he went to work what would guarantee he showed up now I knew better but just for the sake of this experiment when any of these artists asks for prepayment I prepaid them three of the Mast I'll show you what happened artist number one asked for 50% down each time a new drawing was started this guy came through every time and worked quickly that was lampblack artists number 2 asked for a hundred percent payment upfront before starting any of the sketches I suggested 50% down payment they agreed so I sent it that was a year ago they forgot a few months ago I was sent a DM to let me know they forgot and then they forgot again as of today I have not yet been refunded my 50% deposit artist number three was sent the job specs last March and asked for a prepayment in April I agreed and he completed the job eight months later hearing back from him became unpredictable he explained that he took on other clients and the whole gig lost so much momentum that both of us became slower to reply to each other much more so than in any of my other transactions some of that was me but after we'd settled on a price for merch designs and I'd paid for half up front this artist edited the existing invoice on PayPal to add another 30 pounds without telling me so when I paid the second half at first I didn't notice that additional money had been tacked on but I did notice it eventually and when I asked him about it he said that's just my policy which is available on my website if you have any questions feel free to ask the three digital artists that I've shown his work to are convinced that the technique he delivered to me is an over paint a layperson might call over painting tracing and drawing overtop I asked the artist about how he did this one-to-one accurate technique down to the smallest detail when you zoom in he said no over painting that this was all drawn by hand so in conclusion in two out of three cases pre payment up front was a bad idea I would recommend saying this I'm not comfortable prepaying but I have budgeted for your invoice and I will send payment promptly after delivery but if they still really insist and you really want to hire them offer would it be all right if I sent a partial down payment after I see the sketch pushing back on the prepayment puts the risk back on the artist so you really need to be a good client if the merch becomes a regular thing you may want to do some more work with them in the future that they had a bad experience they're gonna say no or they're gonna bump your job out of the queue so they can work with somebody like most artists will do a sketch first after they've absorbed the job requirements and gotten an idea of how to pursue it's usually very rough it's not in color and it's only meant for very broad feedback such as am I on the right track what they really want to know is if I fill this in and I make it look really pretty do you see anything about this composition that's not gonna work for the final project if you do see a problem now is the time to tell them if you're sent work that needs feedback provide it right away as soon as you see the message then they can keep in the flow on your work and they won't have to start looking for another project because their client is procrastinating the next step is the comp itself now this is where 80% of the artists work on the project will be done the art is created as close to the final product as possible and then feedback is requested if details need to be adjusted like colors changed or text moved a client should send all of those notes at once revisions generally speaking are where an artist and a client are gonna make or break their relationship without changes the client might not be happy with the art and likewise if too many changes are asked for or asked for in a rude way then the artist might never want to work with that client again yes you're giving the money but just remember artists have feelings artwork even for pay is somewhat personal part of it came from the artist so praise what you like about it if you give only criticism that can be very crushing to the artistic spirit don't be stingy with the compliments they made this thing so that you would like it they want you to like it now if you have some changes that are hard to swallow and you're not really sure how to serve them up try this management technique I invented a little while back called the compliment sandwich you can convince anybody to keep almost anything it's part of a well-crafted sandwich and goes something like this wow this is amazing so is that maybe you could flip this layer cuz I think it'll work better for my purposes but wow this is incredible I love it I am so happy tell them what you like tell them what you'd like to see more of and then tell them what you like during the finishing stage an artist will make the changes that were requested the client knows what they're getting and the job is about 95% done this is a good time to send over their payment the final stage is delivered the artwork files are sent over and the Commission is now complete the only thing left to do is download the file make sure that it opens in Photoshop or whatever the case may be and to verify that all the revisions were made as requested now if they weren't made correctly you can still straighten that out at this face but if new feedback is given at this stage that was not mentioned in the revision stage this is where an artist might start to get frustrated this is where you start to become the nightmare client new requests become a second revision and it's not uncommon for artists to ask for more money if a completed project gets kicked back into an active project by late requests don't withhold your praise at the end as a negotiating tactic once they do the work don't be a jerk and pretend that you're not gonna use it just sinking at the price lower once you've picked an artist and you've agreed on a price that money is already spent unless the artist accent let's call it bad faith pay the price you agreed some of the art that we bought will probably never get used on merch and that's okay let's take a look at the art anyway number 1 Omega black if you follow cursed image accounts or visit creepy sub reddits then you've probably met Omega blacks monster Garfield when I hired mr. black I said here are my two favorite shirts I'm hoping you could design one with my skull on it and he said we'll be right back he came back with my two new favorite shirts number two death think death thinks line art is hyper detailed he didn't just draw me exploding on a scooter he littered it with Easter eggs related to this channel he also hand-painted a font for us rather than use an existing plot which is actually an option jig when it comes to input from the client death think is an anomaly on this list in that he really doesn't want it he wants to be given space and then turned loose so ideally you would tell him nothing he's at a point in his career where he is willing to take commissioned work but only if he believes in the client you may try to choose death things but in the end death must choose you number three Chris Lynn Chris's aesthetic reminds me of MTV in the 1990s everything Chris makes looks gross but in a playful cartoonish way his ideal client lets him experiment a little bit with their concept which only makes sense because with the way he sees the world a mutated version of whatever you send him is what you should expect number four Ultra Joe if you listen to the baited podcast then you're probably just as familiar with ultra Joe's work the caricatures he does of youtubers have become legendary Joe puts it simply a dream client comes with ideas and a nightmare client watch something cool but doesn't know what number five cyan gorilla cyan gorillas fantasy paintings look like they jumped off of a Magic the Gathering card so if you're in need of some art that doesn't look like it came from Planet Earth talk to the green gorilla you'll have to pause this on a large screen if you want to read the book see row number six back nine fellow youtuber and graphic designer faff 9 maybe the best in the world at making movie posters for movies that don't exist so when I needed a full-page ad for rusty cages comic book I hit up fat he likes to work with high resolution images and he was not pleased with the folder I sent everyone else so we shot new photos for theft and sent them in RAW format just like he likes and that was worth every bit of extra effort because he took those photos and made this in less today we've been using FAFSA poster to test print-on-demand companies and a very nice printing of it is available at nerd City right now number seven Katrine saroo Catron is an art student from Iceland who caught my attention with these nasty pin ups so I figured who better to try and capture the appeal of our own nasty demon Catrin is a tinkerer I was shown Draft after draft which I approved every time and every time she'd come back with something a little bit different and a little bit better if she may have a few extra steps to her creative process but I've come to believe every step she takes in a day is part of her creative process she'll draw a crazy cartoon and then a few days later her face looks like that which is obviously a peculiar hobby right but weirdness is not necessarily a bad sign if you're in the market for art in her case her creativity is clearly pushing her hard and she goes with it and that's what we pay to tap into to be Catron's dream client know what you want show examples answer questions and have patience number eight Eliza Hall's worth Eliza is currently heartbroken after discovering that a painting she purchased in a thrift store for next to nothing was an unknown work by famous painter Margaret Cohen and is worth quite a bit of money museums would want it unfortunately Eliza had already painted over the signature and changed the colors when she saw Cohen's work in a museum and figured out what she'd done you know what they say about paintings of flowers right well not much can be said about the dripping eggplants Eliza painted for us I'd love to show you this whole painting but I have to censor it because her emojis are so obscenely veiny Eliza H describes the ideal pitch as seduction I think safe to say she's the horny or something lampblack alright then Lampe is a bit of a bogan so I don't always understand what he's trying to tell me good luck yourself trying to understand that last sentence lampblack is the awesome post the scrambled asses old brain my same and his files as lay as a lovely that keeps his layers in order and he's got heaps of em hey which makes any edits easy I'm sure you can see by how many times I've hired him over and over and over his time is worth every penny number 10 warm water wormboy either is staying in character most of the time or is a demonic worm hard to say first time I talked in he didn't hiss at me a bit I suppose I describe his art style as oh that's spooky whatever it's called it is influential which I can't blame him for losing his patience about sometimes we're on boys Commission's have been seen on playing cards video game merchandise all kinds of products he built out a whole world of these characters so if I had to guess he's found to end up working on like a comic book or a video game or TV series eventually his commission status flicks on and off so if you see it on swoopin early bird gets to work with the worm boy looking back on history every civilisation is judged by the art it leaves behind it's the artists that stand out after the wars it's the artists that are remembered a culture is judged by the art [Music] how will your culture be remembered when you find an artist that you like support them before we go I want to hopefully they'll forgive me for how long this video took as you can see it took so long to finish this video that I have a beard now and I didn't want it started please subscribe and hit the bell if you're new to this channel thought Patrol is next Oh [Music] they're imaginary phone
