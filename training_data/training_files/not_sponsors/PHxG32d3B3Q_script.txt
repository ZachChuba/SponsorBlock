on the list of essentials when packing for a trip is always the toothbrush which I somehow managed to forget most of the time but what if you come to just buy one and you had to make it yourself including the toothpaste well that's what I'm gonna explore in this video as I attempt to recreate my own toothbrush and toothpaste from scratch along the way I'll dig into how both used to be made involving animal hair and recreating two types of toothpaste that were used in the past also be recreating a more modern toothpaste intersecting the purpose of each item as I source them across three different states my name is Andy and this is how to make everything first for some help a visit dentist dr. sham blot for a quick crash course on dental hygiene and its history why do we need to clean our teeth from day to day eating and consuming beverages and things you develop some plaque and food particles that if they stay on your teeth they'll fuel the bacteria that cause decay these bacteria will excrete an acid that will over time literally little holes in your teeth that's what we call cavities or decay with toothbrushes and toothpaste and floss we're able to get those organisms and food and sugar and everything off the teeth the first item I want to make is a toothbrush the toothbrushes evolved a lot over time just the way toothpaste has it started off with with the twigs and it evolved into I hate hair and other things that I wouldn't even dream of putting in my mouth by today's standards big hair was used because it would stiff bristles which was once believed to be ideal for brushing your teeth as Dennis we told everybody to get in there and really scrub now we know what that does it wears away the enamel it causes the gums to shrink away and recede it's one of those cases where lessons not always more the thing I like best now are the mechanical toothbrushes because they do a far better job than they would with just a manual toothbrush dream world of being able to buy premade items so it's off to a pig farm or some hair okay we're a little put farm with Karin here and get some Pig hair to make a toothbrush have you ever used the pig hair before for anything for DNA testing and he said they don't really mind just plucking it right off or anything you don't for the most part tough skin there you have some players in so I'm just gonna grab the hairs and put the flat nose pliers and yank well he doesn't mind that much you couldn't do this with just anymore all right you couldn't actually be out here with just anyone really I mean but these guys these heritage breeds are just much more docile and much more manageable all right thing zoo it your hair done do your nails next so I was able to pluck the hair from the pigs just with a pair of pliers and they even seem to mind at all we're more interested in rubbing up against me the tripod our crew everybody is just more interested in getting as his head scratch and the fact that all of his hair was getting plucked out now with the bristles of my brush I just need to stick to attach it to and then adhere it there with some boiled pigs hide glue while I let the glue set on my toothbrush next I'll need some toothpaste for that dr. sham block had a few more suggestions for me toothpaste is is a vehicle to help you know scrub and get the plaque and bacteria and food particles off your teeth the basic components of a toothpaste are there's abrasives which are act kind of like a sandpaper almost to help get things off the teeth help polish the teeth to a certain degree flavor chemicals things to make it have a tolerable taste use if we didn't add flavors on top of the toothpaste would taste pretty nasty toothpaste can be traced back to roughly 5000 BC the initial toothpastes were made from ox who've ashes and crushed bones over time they added other items to make him a little more abrasive the Edit charcoal they had chalk and other things to make them a little bit more abrasive and to clean a little better oh it's Jesus about these historical toothpastes that have been used so I want to try one using ingredients I've already collected from other projects some jibsen seashells pumice and animal hooks two different methods were used by Egyptians and Persians gonna chemically go combination of them roast the seashells and hooves grind it up into a powder and make my little toothpaste no it's nasty burnt hair yeah just like the Egyptians take your cuisine artillery up mmm sounds like burnt hair just how you want your active smell I also found a 14th century British recipe to use some ingredients I've previously produced back when I made a sandwich from scratch salt flour and honey now the fun part getting the toothpaste in the tube not not a normal toothpaste flavor right up many dentists recommend rubbing pure sugar on your teeth I'll eventually be getting some volunteers to help test these interesting toothpastes out but first I want to try and replicate a more modern style of toothpaste as well first up an abrasive and filler that is most often the number one ingredient in most modern toothpastes hydrated silica which is basically sand I have some sand here I got from the Mississippi River and I'm going to go through a process here to purify it into just pure silicon dioxide and in the process hopefully hydrate it into hydrated silica basically you're gonna act like sandpaper and clean your teeth you chemically purify the sand it's first mixed with a strong gaze apply and baked at 600 degrees Fahrenheit for 320 degrees Celsius [Music] or fumes then dissolve it into water and filter up the impurities there's strong acid like sulphuric it slowly reacted to it to form a cyclic acid turned into a nice jelly after that rinsed up with water [Music] like I'm going to perform a musical act and the final solution is boiled down to a dry sand at this point the particle size are usually ground to an ideal amount the type of toothpaste with a more coarser grain form or whitening toothpaste but I'm just gonna skip that step and rehydrate it another common abrasive ingredient for cleaning is chalk which I can make by grinning up some calcite rock a third abrasive in cleaning option is one I accidentally came across while I was collecting salt at the Redmond salt mine in Utah bentonite clay so in addition to the great salt deposits we have here in Utah there's also a lot of other minerals so this behind us is a deposit of volcanic ash known as bentonite their way that this particular deposit was discovered was when the early settlers came into the area the natives were using this for all things topical using it topically for burns and bee stings spider bites and if you look at under a microscope as a fine powder it has a very large surface area to surface tension ratio so one gram of clay has the surface area of 800 square meters and something that's that small that has a surface area that large draws stuff into it growing up whether it was because my dad was cheaper because he was a genius he would often brush our teeth with a combination of clay powder and salt powder clays the polisher and the cleanser because it breaks down the biofilms and the salt is a great antibacterial if they use it in high amounts to help promote good oral health but it doesn't taste very good to make this with a toothpaste what you would do is you'd rush it to a powder and then if you hydrate it with water it becomes a paste so if I collect some myself yeah please you have help yourself all right mix of redmond minerals got some fun tonight and it'll make some toothpaste one last cleaning ingredient that is oftentimes found at toothpaste is baking soda which can both act as a cleaning agent but also helped neutralize any damaging acids in your mouth and right here I have some the Metron i collected in wyoming Natron itself was actually used for toothpaste by the egyptians but most of this is gonna be soda ash so I'm gonna dissolve it into water reacted with this tank of carbon dioxide bubble the carbon dioxide it through it and then out should precipitate baking soda now it's also a lot of other impurities which hopefully should stay dissolve it should have very pure baking soda left then all these minerals aren't necessarily gonna have the best taste so I'll try to add a little flavor from some peppermint plants so I got a really jerry-rigged steam distillation setup missing a few needed parts and some things stuff is missing and some of its broken so kind of jerry-rigged a setup that will hopefully work so if I want my toothpaste not to have that nice taste burnt hair the other stuff I made would I'm gonna add a little bit of peppermint oil extract so previously I did a regular mint extract for my candy canes and I did that by extracting using alcohol which is an effective method but it's slow and it gets kind of diluted so I'm gonna do with a process called steam distillation this time we're load up this vessel here with a bunch of mint leaves and then steam is gonna be generated from this bottom flask go through it extract the oils and then get condensated and come out the other end in theory [Music] didn't work at all not even a single drop obviously about way too big of a biomass flask boiled up condensate it inside of it drip down back into the boiling flask so instead of separating it being distilled I have a combination of water and peppermint oil they have different boiling points so I'm still gonna try and see if I can salvage this by distilling this and separating out the water should boil at a lower temperature and leave behind the peppermint oil so give that a shot probably not the ideal way to do this but it might work so I have the hydrated silica purified from Mississippi sand and hydrated I have some baking soda a very small amount is able to make from the Natron I got in Wyoming I have from the bentonite clay we got in Utah as well as in calcite they got from Cody in Utah and then to give a little bit of flavor of the peppermint oil which should both give it a bit of a minty flavor and also act as somewhat of a preservative so it's gonna come out all together put in the tube and we'll try out all the different toothpaste recipes I made [Music] got my toothpaste all set now and I just gotta have some people try it out but before I test them doctor Shambala thought there's one more very important but somewhat dangerous ingredient worth mentioning that I was unable to procure fluoride hands-down the most important ingredient fluoride in high concentrations and in large quantities can be dangerous you really really need fluoride in your toothpaste periodically I have patients come in that tell me that they don't use 4-eyed in their toothpaste and almost every one of them has a ton of cavities now with everything put together I'll have some volunteers try it out absolutely not I will never put this in my mouth I'm scared you know I don't hate the toothbrush that much I would use this for the novelty of it it's fun I'm not sure how my dentist would feel about this I'd have to ask them Oh God oh look at that it's like hair dye oh it looks like squidding toothpaste oh geez is this supposed to like be liquid this looks like the eyeliner that you made it looks like it's literal diarrhea we've ever wanted to see a 21 year old cry you're gonna see it today it hurts my gums it's very pokey I want my kid to be clean I can't even like describe the flavor my tongue feels weird now like I'm used to it I'm not alarmed to the flavor I think it was the initial shock of it like I could keep going like now that I know it's horse hooves I can say it was definitely horse hooves I feel like I just licked my dog how do you describe something so awful I love when you guys prank me and just give me dirt to put in my mouth it just tastes like burnt the sound of like honey kind of like makes it much better than horse hooves this stuff is not coming out oh it's coming out on its own yeah look at it go oh this is like the most toothpaste consistency out of all do you them I feel it looks like bird poop but it also looks them closest to vomit so I'm not sure how into it I really am no fear 3 2 1 oh no oh that is the worst one I'm gonna cry it was salty this one tasted like straight-up salt and I did not like that also we like had this weird like texture in my mouth we're like a clumped up and like stuck to things and it just mmm nope not feeling it I can't even describe it it is very salty it is alarmingly salty and almost made me vomit my throat hurts well this one looks a lot more pleasant it actually has like a paste consistency details try this oh my god oh it doesn't taste bad but it doesn't taste good either it's like the taste of ocean water without the soul oh that makes sense it's like gum after you've chewed it for 6 hours and it's still in your mouth for some reason oh the aftertaste isn't that bad it's like an herb it tastes like a plant like when you eat like grass when you're like 5 and it has like that chlorophyll taste yeah I don't taste any mint and this just lost sand I swallowed some not terrible I don't know if I'd call it toothpaste but Andy did a great job last one won me over it actually wasn't terrible no dr. Shambala would probably agree if I was gonna attempt to make my own toothpaste from scratch would you recommend well first I'd recommend you not do that after those rave reviews you might be wondering why I didn't try it myself but why would I try that disgusting toothbrush when I just got sent this really nice elect a toothbrush from our sponsor so I'm just gonna use that [Music] if you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe and check out other content we have covering a wide variety of topics also if you enjoy these series consider supporting us on patreon we are largely a fan funded channel and depend on the support of our viewers in order to keep our series going thanks for watching
