that's my sunspots there it is fitmin this means Nikki grenade portion should kill there it is oh my god [Music] will he die to it haha [Music] introducing the Phoenix cradle exotic boots for Titan what these do is these allowed the Sun warrior perk to last twice as long and allies who pass through your sunspots get the benefits of Sun warrior as well for those unaware how bottom tree sunbreaker works if you damage somebody with any incendiary damage this could be your grenade your melee it could be Polaris Lance it could be prometheus lens etc if you damage them with incendiary and pick up the kill it creates a sunspot and this Sun SPOT is very useful because it cools down your grenade melee and class ability as well as restoring your health on the initial kill it also boosts your damage by 20% which is why I'm using the mountain top because it has the sticky grenade perk so you can put sticky grenades on the floor and when you have somewhere your active it will one-shot people who walk over it to ensure I have the most amount of sun spots possible I'm using the exotic Polaris Lance scout rifle which features the perk called the perfect fifth basically landing for precision shots loads a incendiary grenade into your gun and if you shoot it it will burn people and if you pick up the kill on that burn you will create a Sun SPOT if your opponent burns out naturally to the Polaris Lance incendiary you would have to shoot like headshot Bonni Bonni for that to happen and it would create a Sun SPOT in my opinion this is like the scout rifle version of the not forgotten hand cannon because your benefit is hitting consecutive headshots to then body shot combo something that benefits you in this case by purposely going for a body shot you are creating a Sun SPOT this build gets crazier though it goes even beyond that check this out I'm going to prop the perfect fifth my incendiary round I'm going to shoot it on the floor and my teammate who is also a Sun breaker is going to pick up the kill and create a Sun SPOT that both of us can take advantage of keep in mind your teammate has to copy your build exactly and also where the exotic boots for you both to take advantage of the Sun SPOT in other words the more people who run this build on your team the better it is because you can all leech each other's Sindhi area kills to create more sunspots hopefully I've done a good job of explaining the build but if I didn't and the details are still a bit hazy then take this gameplay in the background as a overall example to clear it up pay extra attention to how I'm shooting people in the face and trying to time my incendiary around to when I'm able to clean it up with my mountaintop when I do this it creates a sunspot that me and my teammates can take advantage of and I am by myself in this gameplay if I had six people six of me running this exact same build we'd be having sunspots non-stop and maybe I'll revisit that idea again in like iron banner or something for your guys's enjoyment let me know in the comments section anyway I'm gonna stop talking enjoy the gameplay and I will see you in the next that these D dollars can go find new hobby in every future video from now on I won't go into extreme detail about VPNs but I'll remind you guys at the end that my link is in the description and I might give a VPN fact of the day maybe just to be cheeky and remind these deed officers that uh we're gonna use protection now thank you guys for watching thanks for following my stuff and I'm gonna stop talking you're the best that's why we have parties wouldn't give to fight again beyond the walls I would tear out of X heart with my teeth I would sear the Cabal with my burning lights challenge the Fallen curls to personal combat and scatter them I I've been watching too many crucible matches only five minutes left three minutes what can stop you if you fight together nothing to match with you again a single victory doesn't win a war but it's a start good work
