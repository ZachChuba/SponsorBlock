locate but this encounter offers many teachable moments that are worth exploring based on the video it is clear that this interaction took place somewhere in the state of Nevada and features trooper Van Alen of the Nevada Highway Patrol I was unable to determine when this interaction took place or what exactly occurred before the video begins but you are free to draw your own conclusions based on the conversation between officer Van Alen and the individuals she stopped okay ma'am I'm recording for my own safety the speed limit is 65 I was going 66 and you're all mine and then he tailgate me and then you go faster than me you're an officer of the law - speed limit states at a 65 so you are not allowed to go past that speed limit period what makes you think that just because you're an officer that you can go what did I do wrong I would like to identify I do not have to I have not committed a crime what was my crime please some of the charges that committee please tell me the conduct committed where does the state and a lotta cheer allowed to go over the speed limit electrics emergency all officers are subject to the very same motor vehicle codes that apply to citizens the laws regarding when an emergency vehicle may legally violate those codes varies from state to state but are typically very similar in their scope and structure Nevada Revised statute 484 B dot 700 states that the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle who is responding to an emergency call in pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law responding to a fire alarm or escorting a funeral procession may disregard certain traffic codes within reason however subsection 2 of that code states that the driver of the emergency vehicle must have their emergency lights on while doing so it is impossible to know for sure whether trooper vanillin had her emergency lights on but based on the conversation between the trooper and the individual she stopped it does not appear as though she did trooper Van Allen also admits later in the video that she was in fact speeding please tell me the NRS code that states that or the DMV codes and traffic laws the state that you can do that okay no please say that um I'm invoking my Fifth Amendment right do you know what my Fifth Amendment right is okay you're an officer law Fifth Amendment right States and when I invoke that whatever charge a crime you're committing me of you have to go ahead and state that and show it to me there in the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution established many precedents in regards to both criminal and civil legal proceedings such as the right to remain silent the right to due process the doctrine of double jeopardy and many others but the Fifth Amendment does not dictate that law enforcement officers must inform citizens of why they are being stopped in fact no laws or constitutional amendments were by our officers to articulate their suspicions or reasons for detainment to citizens or suspects while it is true that under the Terry doctrine officers must be able to articulate specific facts that led them to make an arrest or effectuate a detention they are not required to verbalize those facts to anyone outside of a courtroom okay so please tell me the NRS code that states you're allowed to go faster than 65 unless it is an emergency and nine times out of ten when they're speeding they're making unsafe lane changes right you're way behind me man I saw you long ago and you came really quick up on me I have a breathalyzer okay record everything okay so it records my speed I stay at 65 I use my cruise control okay so I'm glad that you do your speed limit and all that but I'm just trying to let you know so again tell me please please tell me what crime I committed for what for you're charged here with so then I do not have to give you my ID identify myself because I'm not no I know I do not I've not committed a crime and I'm not under arrest it states it in the law although Nevada is a stop and identify' state officers are still required to have reasonable suspicion of a crime before they may demand identification from a suspect trooper Van Allen stated that she only stopped the individual to have a conversation and while the law does permit her to lie about her reasoning the rest of the video clarifies that her motives for the stop were exactly that if the detention were to be challenged in court it would require little effort from trooper Van Alen to justify her stop by some other means as noted by justice Dee Arthur Kelsey of the Supreme Court of Virginia quote so dense is the modern web of Motor Vehicle regulations that every motorist is likely to get caught in it every time he drives to the grocery store this notion is also reflected in a colloquial phrase that often circulates various law enforcement agencies quote if you can't find a reason to pull someone over then you aren't trying hard enough there is a wealth of jurisprudence and philosophical ideologies at play when discussing over-regulation which I will not get into in this episode but the pole is that even in an encounter where the officers ill intentions are plainly on display there are still legitimate legal defenses that would be difficult to disprove with in a courtroom nonetheless it is difficult to understand how refusing to provide identification in the absence of reasonable suspicion constitutes a safety concern for trooper Van Alen it's letting you know instead of having a conversation at 65 mile an hour the library guard was flashing I was trying to catch somebody up there right not only is trooper Van Alen openly admitting that she only stopped the individual to have a conversation with him but she also admitted to abandoning her pursuit of a potentially criminal activity to do so okay that's my god-given right to protect the safety of the community when somebody's doing 80 up there they're normally zigzagging out of traffic that makes it unsafe for a 92 year old grandma and I don't like that because my mother drives these roads okay am i on paper as far as what parole or probation huh I do not have to identify myself I don't I've not committed a crime as is the case in many other states individuals in Nevada who have been convicted of a felony may have certain civil liberties revoked such as the right to vote bare arms or the right to hold public office as dictated in the Nevada State Constitution Nevada used to have one of the most complicated civil rights restoration schemes in the country in which the loss and restoration of civil rights depended upon the nature of an individual's crime and overall criminal record but in May of 2019 the Nevada Legislature passed Nevada assembly bill 431 which dramatically simplified the system and loosened the state's grip on the liberties of those who have been previously convicted all that said there are many crimes which can result in a citizen being placed on probation and that does not necessarily mean that the citizen automatically loses all of their rights the rights protected under the Fourth and Fifth Amendment's are not subject to revocation based on criminal history anyone who is not currently incarcerated is entitled to Fourth Amendment protections and all citizens regardless of their criminal past or current level of incarceration are entitled to Fifth Amendment protections I don't have to disclose anything and if you really want to go down that road no I'm not on probation or parole just to satisfy your need to go ahead and pry information from me I have the right to drive on public roadways in the US without any infringement upon me or papers check this is I just wanted to have a conversation and I'm just letting you know that you're an officer of the law and you're supposed to uphold it so you shouldn't be speeding or tailgating if I tell gated you you would have pulled me over immediately the second you got around me you would have took off to go get that person but you didn't I owed you an explanation okay what's more important giving me an explanation of protecting the roads and safety is your so stating you're trying to uphold no that's fine sergeant come out not a problem the trooper in the citizen continued their banter and eventually a sergeant arrives on the scene hello sergeant Kelly how are you doing today I've been better a little bit upset at the fact that your officers stating the claims she's stating it's very unprofessional and upsetting that an officer the law can't give me the NRS code that apparently I'm violating but then she tells me I have not committed a crime area charge so I do not have to identify myself and if she really felt that concern for her safety she would have stepped away from my window and she would have backed up and wait until you her supervisor came to assess the situation obviously she's still standing there having a full conversation with me for eight minutes she obviously does not have a concern for her safety she just want to do of papers check because I know when you run the ID it goes into the database in the show that I had an interaction with law enforcement and I'm not having that on my record so I do not have to declare my identity because I have not committed a crime I'm not under arrest you're right you're not under arrest at the moment that you were detained she never stated that officer any time that any time an emergency vehicle stops you you are detained okay just so you know all right may not be under arrest but you are detained at that moment but I still do not because that my idea I stood on that 2% my ID technically by law you don't have to present your ID thank you for staying but by law you do have to provide your name no I do not okay I'm not preventing identity that's giving it argue with you after speaking with her you're free to go at the moment okay but for future reference you do have to state okay and for future reference you need an advisor officer that just because she's a law enforcement official if I had tailgated her the way she tailgated me you guys would have pulled me over in a heartbeat I'm not I wasn't there I didn't see that okay have your badge number police t14 okay I'll be making a formal complaint since you do not want to go ahead and reprimand your officer for the fact that she was driving unsafe for what I do with my officers a personnel matter which is not public record and like I said I will go to your superiors but thank you I know I'm free to go on to stating for the record that I will be making a formal complaint because you refuse to go in let your officer know that she does not have the authority to tailgate more to speed unless it is an emergency you have a nice day officer use the shoulder here to get up to speed otherwise we're just be careful okay yep as mentioned at the beginning of this episode I was unable to locate any follow-up information for this interaction but it appears as though the citizen was allowed to go free without further incidents it is also unclear whether the citizen proceeded with filing a formal complaint against the trooper overall trooper Van Alen gets an F for detaining a citizen to have a conversation attempting to identify that citizen without reasonable suspicion and displaying a fundamental misunderstanding of constitutional protections it appears as though much of this interaction and trooper Van Allen's policing tactics were dictated by her emotions not the law and much of the troopers actions were far outside the bounds of her authority like any other job law enforcement officers must adhere to the guidelines associated with their profession and retained the mental capacity to separate their emotions from their duties while there should be some level of discretion afforded to officers in the field that discretion should never be compromised by the officers emotional status or psychological dispositions trooper Van Allen would do well to brush up on the basics of policing and become more acquainted with the protections guaranteed to all citizens by the very Constitution that she swore an oath to uphold the citizen gets an a- because although he was mistaken about the language of the Fifth Amendment he maintained a collected and relatively articulate demeanor remained vigilant in reserving his constitutional rights and rightfully questioned the legitimacy of trooper Van Allen's conduct if there is one silver lining to this interaction it is that the citizen was ultimately allowed to go free and intended to file a complaint against the trooper the citizens legal knowledge served him well during this encounter and even if he was wrong about certain legal principles the ones that he was right about were invoked efficiently while I recommend that the citizen also reexamined the protections granted by the Constitution I also commend him for his conversational agility and legal awareness this interaction highlights the fact that even a surface level understanding of laws and civilian rights can serve to protect citizens against misconduct and I encourage all citizens to gain a basic understanding of they're local laws and the rights guaranteed to them under the Constitution let us know if there is an interaction
