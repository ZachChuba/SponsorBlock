Hey so I was at work the other day validating patient results like I do I know there's someone new patients clinical details I just said hiccups I remember thinking oh my God why are you wasting NHS resources by coming to the doctor with hiccups your blood work is fine but I had a quick little research and found out that hiccups actually can be quite sinister in certain scenarios but before we get into all of that what actually is a hick a hiccup is simply an involuntary contraction of the diaphragm and once triggered this reflex is followed by a closure of the vocal cords about 0.25 seconds later which results in the classic fake sound hiccups can repeat several times per minute and the time in between hiccups is normally relatively constant there's often no obvious reason when you get hiccups but some people find certain things trigger their hiccups such as stress strong emotions like being excited or laughing or eating or drinking in rare cases they can be a sign of a serious problem hiccups can present with various conditions like kidney failure ms meningitis or even following damage to the vagus nerve following surgery but there was a case of chronic hiccups I made it onto the news a guy from Britain was reported to have hiccups once every two seconds for 12 hours a day Eiling up to 1,800 hiccups an hour 21600 a day and only 7.9 million a year he unsurprisingly had difficulty talking sleeping and eating as a result of the constant hiccupping and it got to a point where he was forced to stop driving as he was afraid of crashing he went to the doctors Abbey woods well as I hope you would but despite blood tests and scans he was left undiagnosed but because of all of his incessant hiccuping he was actually flown to Tokyo by Japanese television company he wanted to make a documentary about him and his hiccupping and while he was there he had an MRI scan which discovered a 1 point 2 centimeter growth on his brainstem in a letter to pass on the British doctors the Japanese specialist who saw him wrote less than a handful of Surgeons would touch this tumor if it cannot be operated on and his radiotherapy or chemotherapy to save this boy's life it was salt that the pressure from the slow-growing tumor which luckily turned out to be benign infected his nervous system triggering the nonstop hiccups and despite being warned that the tumor was practically inoperable he flew home for brain surgery the operation removes 60% of his tumor and he reported that his hiccups had pretty much disappeared however after the surgery he experienced numbness on his left side and he had difficulty with his coordination and of course of course we could not do a video about cups without mentioning the bond that set the record for the longest attack of hiccups ever Charles Osborne from Iowa started hiccuping in 1922 and continued to be camping until the year before he died in 1990 so he had kept for a grand total of 68 years in an old interview with People magazine from 1982 Charles recalled how an accident when he was 29 years old resulted in his lifetime of hiccuping he mentioned in the interview I was hanging a 350 pound hog for butchering I picked it up and then I fell down I felt nothing but the doctor said later that I busted a blood vessel the size of a pin in my brain the result according to a doctor that had treated him is that he destroyed a small area in the brainstem that inhibits the hiccup response Charles is said to have hiccup over 430 million times in his lifetime while sleeping the hiccups did used to subside and he used to have them 40 of them per minute which usually reduce to 20 per minute during his wake time and this was because he learned how to breathe in between hiccups that helped suppress the sound at them and he learned this at Mayo Clinic and as he had such a big media presence appearing on Ripley's Believe It or Not on various talk shows he received over 4000 sympathy letters and recommendations for home remedies but sadly none of these work but he did lead a relatively normal life despite his hiccups he was married twice had eight kids and lived until he was 97 and tell me what you think and a big thank you to my patrons on patreon and thank you for watching bye you
