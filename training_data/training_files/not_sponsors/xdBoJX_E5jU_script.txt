hello everyone welcome to annoy - any % random seed run my first one that I'm uploading I just wanted to get this is a PB not world record or anything like that it's just a PB I wanted to get one submitted finally to speed run calm I've done a bunch of these but I didn't feel like anywhere good enough good low enough time this one's decent so I might as well just upload this one before I work on trying to get a better time and I'm doing post commentary just to explain a couple parts I guess make it a little bit more entertaining maybe although I just I'm uploading this just to basically submit it just to be on the leaderboards and I could have teleported down immediately after grabbing the help but I wanted to check the perks here to see if we got rappelling cape which allows us to teleport down a lot faster as he dropped the teleport adium stayin faster and then that wand right there I really I decided to leave it because sometimes you know the pacifist reward chest it spawns right on top of the pertree roll statue and sometimes if it's a wand or a flask then it can be it can take a little while to pick it up and it wastes time so a lot of the time when I'm doing speedruns I don't even bother picking them up because of that you just check to see if it's a good wand then hopefully you can pick it up real quick but then sometimes it's a I don't know why I ran here this time maybe that just check for repelling cape again to see if I could and potentially get money and then here I managed to grab the invisibly um flask but then I throw it away anyway don't really need it but in some runs maybe if you don't get if you're doing a teleport Lister on and you want the invisible iam or just maybe you're doing help or run and the pacifist reward is a flask of teleport a diem and you have trouble picking it up it could be hello bothersome sometimes I'm hoping that the developers decide to move the pacifist chest or the perk reroll statue put it on the left side of the perks instead of the right that would help and then here at teleport right into the big brain and there's a wand but it's fine so right now we still don't have a weapon to defeat the boss with so I'm hoping you know we're already at the vault and then I end up you know right around here it's like kind of panic mode like especially if you know you're getting a pretty decent time which I knew I was getting pretty decent time so now I'm like okay we're in Temple the art I do not have any way to kill the boss quickly so I need to find a wand hopefully we get some good luck with the teleport semi teleport like right next to one that's what was going through my head here like okay there's no wand here let's teleport again and then this is the wand I ended up sticking with right here actually yeah that's the one they end up taking I should have just tried the perks first because as you can see I spend a little bit of time here reorganizing this want throwing out some of the stuff that would kill me if I keep it on there and I could have saved all this time because I didn't end up spoilers I didn't end up using this wand against the boss anyway which is good because it would have taken longer to kill the boss with it I grabbed that always cast and I managed to get always cast acid trail and I do one last minute bomb jump up the ramp a little bit didn't really save any time maybe uh you know ten milliseconds but then that's boom we just drop a bomb right through the boss the acid trail just drips straight through it and instant kill at the Statue under five minutes and tried to kill myself faster but whatever I should just use the acid get through the credits real fast and 3:55 any % random I'll definitely be working on improving that it's just random seed here I showed that I'm not using any mods of course random seed you never know it's random so you could get a really fast runner or just an average run but I'll be working on improving this definitely anyway thank you very much for watching and I'll see you next time much more on the way have a great day peace
