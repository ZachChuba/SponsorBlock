hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with blue cheese walnut chicory salad that's right we actually filmed a salad recipe which is a pretty rare occurrence since who the heck goes online to watch salad videos but we do make the occasional exception for some of the world's greatest salads that I think everybody should know how to do and this absolutely gorgeous specimen is one of those and to get started the first thing we're going to do is toast some chopped walnuts which as usual will do in a dry pan over medium heat and all we have to do here is stir these around or toss them until they become very hot to the touch and they smell and taste like toasted walnuts and by the way I'm doing this wrong don't pick the pan up leave it flat on the stove and just use a horizontal push and pull method to get these to flip and by the way we have a video featuring cheese balls where I teach how to do this so check that out if want and like I said we'll toast these over medium heat until they're very hot to the touch as in almost burn your fingers grabbing one and as soon as those are smelling feeling and tasting just right we'll go ahead and turn off the heat because these nuts are done and then once those are set we can move on to our vinaigrette which is going to be a fairly sweet version of a mustard vinaigrette and that's why our first ingredients gonna be a couple tablespoons of Dijon and usually at this point I would tell to use any mustard want but don't please use Dijon here and then to that we're gonna add a couple relatively sweet vinegars okay the first being a seasoned rice vinegar in the second being a white balsamic or if want the much more common regular balsamic okay they'll both work the same and the only real difference is your dressing will just be a little darker and then to that we will also want to add a nice big pinch of freshly ground black pepper and then what we'll do is go ahead and give this a quick mix before we introduce our olive oil and by the way regarding using multiple kinds of vinegars in the same dressing I wish people would do that more often okay if look at pretty much any salad dressing recipe they're usually only calls for one kind of vinegar but just like bartenders will use different kinds of liquors to make it more interesting drink I think we should do the same thing when we're making salad dressings just don't call us mixologist and please no suspenders in bowties and if got that joke spend way too much time in bars but anyway what we'll do once that's mixed up is go ahead and drizzle in our olive oil while whisking constantly and if start off slow just like a teaspoon at a time until can see it's starting to thicken and emulsify then we can start adding it a little faster and the great thing about a mustard vinaigrette is that there's something in the mustard which I believe is lecithin that actually helps stabilize the emulsion and will keep the oil and vinegar from separating and if everything goes according to plan when you're done should have a beautifully thick mixture that will coat the back of a spoon and it will hold a very very sharp edge when drag your finger across it so that was looking just about perfect and of course will also give that a taste and adjust it if need be okay the secret to a great dressing for bitter greens is that it's very sharp and acidic but also a little bit on the sweet side which is why we did not add too much oil relative to the vinegar and also we chose vinegars that are on the sweet side and then once our dressing is set we can move on to our chicory or chicory Zin this case as we'll be using two of the most common varieties found in the store some radicchio and some Belgian endive and we'll go ahead and start with this beautiful head of radicchio which to prep we will simply cut in half and then carefully but confidently using two angled cuts we will cut out the core and yes I totally blocked that shot with my hand so let's see that again and I blocked that one too but anyway once that core is no more we'll go ahead and cut these halves in half and then simply turn them and slice across into about one inch pieces and by the way I don't recommend snacking on this stuff as cut it okay this stuff is bitter and to many people's tastes borderline inedible but one stress with the nuts and the cheese an absolutely magical transformation happens and it turns into one of the best things you've ever tasted and then what we'll do for our Belgian endive is go ahead and slice a little bit off that root end which is going to allow us to peel off some of these leaves or Spears as they're called and when get to the point where those are not coming off easily can always slice a little more off the bottom although I should have saved that piece and chopped it up since really that first slice is the only one should really discard but anyway what we're doing here is we're gonna keep some of these leaves whole for presentation purposes and then the inside part of the head will go ahead and slice across like this and by the way this ratio is going to be up to okay we can leave all that whole or we can chop everything up and I generally do about half and half but that's gonna be up to I mean are after all the Britney of your Spears whoops I did it again I think I already use that one in an asparagus video but anyway the point is we'll leave some hole and chop the rest up at which point we'll transfer everything into a nice big bowl and we'll give that a little pre tossing to make sure all those leaves are nicely separated and evenly distributed and also practice a little bit for the mane tossing and one set set we'll go ahead and crumble in about half our nuts and then we'll save the rest for the top and then we'll do the exact same thing with whatever blue cheese were going to use so I went ahead and crumbled in about half of what was a very beautiful local blue cheese from Sonoma which I'll be probably compared to like a Stilton although this cell is gonna work with whatever blue cheese like but having said that something that's maybe on a little bit of the richer sweeter side is ideal which I think generally would be blue cheese is made from cows milk as opposed to sheep but anyway talk to your friendly local cheese monger and that's it we'll go ahead and add as much dressing as we think this needs which by the way is a lot okay make sure this is generously dressed and then we'll take a couple clean hands and we'll get in there and get him there deep and we'll toss this and keep tossing it until everything is perfectly coated and know those fancy salad tongs got is a gift at one time don't use those all right that's okay to serve this with all right to properly toss a salad fingers and hands are the best and that's it once our salad has been tossed we can transfer that onto some kind of serving platter and if want to be a little bit extra fancy we can go ahead and place the whole spears around like this and then once those have been placed down we can go ahead and pile the rest of the salad on top at which point any of the nuts and cheese we didn't mix in can get scattered over the top to create what I think is just a visually stunning borderline decadent salad presentation Oh in case you're wondering this is like four portions I would say even though Michelle and I will have no problem finishing this and I didn't this time but if did also want to some nice sweet Crisp apple slices that would be good or pear that would also work but here I was just going for the pure chicory experience and that my friends even if don't think like bitter greens is a shockingly delicious thing to eat so I'm gonna go ahead and grab one of these Spears and start eating this nacho style and if did make the mistake of trying some of the chicory plain and thought to yourself why are we eating something that tastes like this now that it's dressed with that sweet tangy mustard vinaigrette and mixed with those crunchy toasted nuts and that wonderfully rich subtly salty cheese it's all gonna make perfect sense and may actually experience when eat this what we call in the business an epiphany okay when eat a food that has a bitter profile it really amplifies the sweet salty and sour aspects and the other ingredients and not only does the bitterness of the chicory x' enhance the other flavors it also actually stimulates your appetite and it just makes want to eat more and more alright this is why you're more clever chefs generally we'll start off a menu with an appetizer that has a little bit of bitterness to it but anyway I don't want to get too deep into the weeds as I get too deep into these weeds and I'll just finish up by saying this is one of the world's great salads and if you've been looking at radicchio and Belgian endive in the store for years and years but never botany because just didn't think you'd like it well I'm here to tell probably do especially in a salad like this which is why I really do hope give this a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient amounts a printable written recipe
