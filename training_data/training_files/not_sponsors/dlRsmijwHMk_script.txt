this video was sponsored by curiosity stream and pit means are one of the oldest factions in the game having been added to the game in a late devonian expansion the Marine meta at the time was hostile to statements so it made sense that the devs would let smaller fish players who spec into legs and lungs so they could finally join the arthropods on the terrestrial servers the fact that amphibians have remained at least moderately viable in the meta this entire time and survived multiple rounds of balance patches is impressive to say the least and while the amphibian faction has several popular build styles the most well-known is the Frog the roll frogs occupy in the current meta is an odd one at low levels they're easily sump the least powerful builds in the entire game only about half a percent of tadpoles actually reached a late-game and get to unlock the rest of the frog skill tree but is that even worth it how viable is the adult frog there are some things that they're among the best at and from a gameplay perspective I think they offer a fun and unique playstyle but with that said the Frog has a lot of glare and weaknesses holding it back from a higher to your spot in the meta still there are some standout members that have their own unique perks and special abilities that make them more viable than your average 4 in the current meta so today we'll be going over the tier list of the frogs but first let's discuss the basic archetype and what its main advantages and disadvantages are taking a quick look at the Frog stats we can pretty easily see that there are a lot of shortcomings here the Frog player base has Specht into skin and offers stamina regeneration in the water since it can directly exchange oxygen with its surroundings when wet this is a useful ability especially given how costly the frogs jump is in terms of stamina however this skin offers nothing in terms of defense and is easily pierced by any attack the frog also lacks any form of damage boosting abilities having no teeth to boost its bite damage and no horns or spikes to power up its body slam damage giving it one of the lowest power stats in the game it does somewhat make up for this with its strong grab but seeing as this is useless against players in or above the frogs weight class this doesn't factor into the frogs general power level since it's so matchup dependent their intelligence that isn't much to boast about either having one of the simplest brain structures of any vertebrate now for some positives the Frog stealth in most cases is above average cryptic coloration is already a good start and when combined with the fact that their eyes protrude enough to let them remain almost completely submerged while keeping their vision above water frogs can be pretty stealthy this plays nicely with the frogs other decent stat their mobility the frogs basic movement speed is quite low definitely not enough to let them escape an attack or chase down prey however the frog build relies almost exclusively on unconventional movement options their webbed feet give them fairly high swim speed which is pretty important for escaping attacks underwater some frogs also have cling pads which allow them to climb almost any surface with ease they aren't speedy climbers but the range of surfaces they can climb is impressive however obviously the frogs best and most important movement ability is their jump which is by far the best of any vertebrate and second only to the grasshopper in terms of relative distance this jump ability constitutes the core gameplay of the frog build but is this actually a worthwhile ability as an escape option I think it's good in the right situation specifically if there's good cover nearby however it's not that useful when caught out in the open while over short distances it makes the user extremely difficult to catch its high stamina cost means that if safety is far away it's likely you'll burn through all of your stamina before you get there giving your attacker time to catch up it also does nothing to help when you're already caught in a grab though some products have ways of dealing with this too where the frogs job ability really shines through is as an approach option it allows the frog to strike targets from a considerable distance including ones in the air which is important to given that many of the frogs primary targets will have the flying perk combined with the frogs excellent tether grab top frog is one of the best fields in the game at landing grabs on builds that are normally near impossible to hit now with that said leaping at a target requires a strange commitment from the Frog player as the move has a huge amount of endless and leave the user in a potentially vulnerable position if you with this attack by the time the Frog is able to act again it's likely that your target will either be long gone or counter-attacking most of the outside player base considers amphibians to be one of the weakest if not the weakest faction in the entire game their abysmal environmental and disease resistance stats make them extremely vulnerable to gifts in the meta including the climate patch that's been recently added to the game with all of this said despite their harsh rapidly changing meta of the Anthropocene expansion there are plentiful prompt bills that have still had decent success in the center at the bottom of the tier list we have the tree frog the tree frog build swaps out the web to life for cling pads meaning they don't have that grid of swim speed but gain an ear unparalleled climbing ability similar to the gecko my main issue with this building is that the tree frog play style turns the awesome jumping ability of the Frog into more of a liability than an advantage jumping to escape a Predators attack means that you're risking taking some pretty serious fall damage this also means that jumping to catch bugs midair is a non option negating the main benefit of having the ability in the first one now some do mitigate the straw back by also specking into the webbed feet ability which while normally only useful for water mobility can also have the niche effect of reducing fall damage still picking up a costly extra ability for its secondary effect isn't exactly the mark of a top tier indeed here we have well basically all of the pond frogs that stick really close to the standard frog bill that I laid out at the start of this video they have a great jump webbed feet to boost aquatic movements be and solid camouflage and since I just spent the beginning of the video explaining why I think this isn't enough to be viable I won't spend any more time discussing them here they at least get the main benefits out of the abilities that they do have though and are undoubtedly more successful than n fib Ian's like salamanders so I can't place them in bottom here in CT R we have the common toad build the reason toads tend to fare better than your standard pond frog is that they're significantly more sturdy while they aren't exactly armored they're thicker skin is quite good at reducing incoming damage regular frogs are so fragile that even smaller insects can deal lethal damage toads on the other hand and tank at least a few nuts which is usually enough to let them overcome most arthropod opponents this thicker skin has the secondary effect of granting them more resistance to dehydration giving them versatility and range that the standard pond frog can't match this does come at a cost though as toads have a much less powerful jump however since they are less vulnerable to attacks quickly jumping to safety isn't as crucial most toads also incorporate mild chemical defenses to help discourage bills from higher weight classes from griefing them however when it comes to toxic defenses few builds in the game can boast about poison damage more so than the poison dart frog the poison dart frog sports the lowest stats of any frog built even going so far as to drop its stealth rating - all in the name of spending every possible evolution point on one of the most toxic defensive poisons in the game their poison is strong enough to drop any player's HP to zero relatively quickly after biting the Frog player personally I've never been a fan of poison stress since it requires you to be attacked and take damage in order to actually activate its effect on top of this there are very few abilities that I'd suggest such drastic sacrifices in order to attain so the fact that the poison dart frog cuts all of its stats in order to min max for poison damage isn't something I consider that good of a strat there are diminishing returns on toxic and having a poison deadly enough to one-shot an entire herd of elephants doesn't help you that much more than a poison that would inflict pain and sickness debuffs on to a mid-sized carnivore both achieve the same purpose of discouraging attacks from predator players now if the poison dart frog playerbase ever specs into fangs and uses the toxin for venom maybe they'll break into the top tiers still the fact that they can essentially one-shot anyone who attacks them is pretty impressive and earns them an above-average spot on the tier list in eighth year we have the bull frog which is essentially just your basic frog build but with greatly improved stats your average frog is vulnerable to attacks from fish birds insects and snakes but with their added bulk and power bullfrogs have solid matchups against all of these and can even hold their own against powerful predator builds like the house cat because of their favorable matchups spread the bullfrog playerbase has started to take over pond servers that they don't usually spawn in which is the hallmark of a high tier build bullfrogs don't have any special defensive abilities or poison relying solely on their bulk to carry them but imagine if they did have poison in addition to their great stats well that's essentially the cane toad bills the stats of a bullfrog combined with the thick skin and poison defense of a toad the cane toad avoids making the same mistakes as the poison dart frog investing only a moderate amount of evolution points into toxins grants the cane toad a poison that's dangerous enough to for our most predatory bills without going overboard and wasting evolution points on an overly lethal elephant slime stalks and then it doesn't mean the efficiency of this build allows it to easily take over and dominate the Australian meta and in fact the first video that I ever made on this channel was all about how broken they out however that was three years ago and the meta is shifting with some intelligence builds learning the cane toad matchup and using this knowledge to minimize the potential poison damage by attacking only the toads weak point and avoiding the poison glands so I wouldn't be surprised if the cane toads started to drop down from s tier as intelligence builds expose more of the toes flaws but as flawed as they are the frog build has come a long way the amphibian faction as a whole has very humble beginnings but the strategies that they like swapping their fins for legs and gills for lungs are still very much relevant to today's meta if you're supporting my channel in the process thank you so much for watching and good luck out there [Music]
