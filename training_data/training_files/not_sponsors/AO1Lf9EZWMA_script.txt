with salmon medallions
that's right not only will i show you an easy and delicious way to make salmon
i'm going to show you what i think is a very clever technique for turning the
least desirable cut of salmon into something absolutely fabulous so
basically this is one of those when life gives you lemons make lemonade type
lessons although i've never actually got that
saying since i'll take lemons anytime in fact we're going to use one with this
but anyway let's go ahead and get started
with a piece of salmon that i will almost never buy and that would be the
dreaded towel section okay when i purchase salmon i always ask
for a beautiful center cut piece and that's because it's the same
thickness all the way through unlike this one pound tail piece which
is thick at one end but then tapers down to that very thin point at the other end
which makes it very tricky to cook but by using this medallion technique
we're going to turn this less than ideal cut into something very very special
and the first thing we'll do here is remove the skin which i like to do down
on a paper towel because a lot of times you'll have a few
scales left on the skin which will stick to the cutting board and then onto the
meat and then you're spitting out scales and
what we'll do is start our cut as close to that point as we can
and then because it's a little bit slippery we'll use another paper towel
to hold that skin as we cut and grabbing that was definitely the
hardest part of this whole step and then what we'll do once we start our cut
is use sort of a short sawing motion with the blade of that knife flat
against the skin and we actually want to angle our knife
very very slightly towards the skin like just a degree or two since that
stuff is very leathery and hard to cut through
and by doing that we're going to be able to trim that off without cutting into
the meat and if everything goes according to plan
we'll end up with a piece of skin that doesn't have any salmon
and a piece of salmon that doesn't have any skin and by the way if you don't
feel up for that just have them do that for you at the
store i mean it's the least they could do after selling you that crappy piece
of salmon and then once that's been skinned we can
go ahead and trim off any other connective tissue if we need
in case you're wondering the reason we bought a towel piece was because it was
very fresh wild king salmon on sale for a very good price and these
were the only kind of pieces they had and then what we're going to do once
that's trimmed is split it right down the middle lengthwise
right directly through that white line in the center which by the way if that
feels kind of bony you can trim that off too
but if it feels soft like mine did i just leave it it's probably good for you
and then once we have that divided into we'll cut each of those halves into
three strips as even as we can and i should mention in fairness the one
advantage of the tailpiece is you will almost never have to pluck
out any bones so we got that going for us
which is nice and then once our strips are cut we can form our medallions on a
foil-lined baking sheet which i've lightly greased with olive
oil and we'll take our first strip with the thickest part in the center
and we'll sort of wrap it around itself to form a spiral and then we'll take our
second piece starting with the thinner end and
overlap it a little bit where we left off
and continue to wrap it around and then for the third and last piece
basically anything goes and we're just going to try to position it
whichever way gives us the most uniform circle
and if you notice me flipping it over there we always want the best looking
side facing up oh and don't worry too much about these
staying together as we are going to fasten these with some foil to hold them
together okay so that's looking not bad and i
went ahead and did my second portion oh and one thing to be aware of don't
use the three biggest pieces on one and the three smallest on the other
all right make sure you mix and match so they're fairly even
and then what we'll do once our salmon has been medallion is take about a 15
inch piece of foil about four inches wide and we'll fold
that over a few times to make sort of a collar
and we'll use that to surround our salmon and kind of cinch it up
and once we have that in place we'll kind of pinch and crimp those two pieces
together at which point we're just going to do
some fine tuning okay we're going to try to get this as
round as possible as well as we want that salmon as uniform of thickness as
possible and then last but not least we want to
press that foil down so that it's no higher than the salmon
in fact it's probably even a little better if it's just below that top edge
and that's it once both portions of salmon have been coiled and cuffed
we can move on to mixing up our secret sauce which is nothing more than a
couple tablespoons of mayonnaise a little bit of cayenne and then finally
some freshly squeezed lemon juice and believe it or not this stuff is
based on something called alabama white sauce
which is usually made with mayonnaise vinegar and pepper but since we're using
this with salmon i went with the lemon but if you wanted your favorite vinegar
woodwork here so that's up to you i mean you are after all the italian
stallion of your salmon medallion which reminds me a nice garlic aioli
would work as well and then once that's mixed we'll go
ahead and season the top of our salmon with some salt
and we'll do that fairly generously and then one season we'll go ahead and
slather on our sauce dividing that as equally as we can
between those two portions and not only is this stuff going to add
some flavor but it's also going to sort of insulate our fish from the heat
and it's going to help keep these medallions very very moist
so we'll go ahead and spread that over at which point these are ready to
transfer into the center of a very hot 450 degree oven for just
10 minutes or so or until our salmon is just barely
cooked through and looks like this okay even though it was only in there
for like 10 minutes you're probably still going to get a little bit of
browning on the top and that's it these are ready to serve
as soon as we remove that foil collar which i'm gonna do with a fork and a
pair of foil salmon collar tweezers or if you're careful just use your
fingers and yes i didn't but you really should oil that foil before you wrap it
around your salmon although this did come off pretty easily
and then once that was defoiled i went ahead and plated it up
on a beautiful shaved cucumber salad because i wanted to pretend i was one of
those fancy spas-getting treatments and i said treatments not at a spa
getting treatment right that's a different kind of spa and
then i finished up with some freshly chopped dill
because i had some around and it is really good with salmon
and that's it i did a few last shakes of cayenne on the top just to stain shape
and my salmon medallion was ready to enjoy
and that my friends was just an absolutely delicious very flavorful
perfectly cooked piece of salmon okay this really was very moist and had the
most wonderful texture and since we're only using a couple
ingredients that beautiful fresh salmon gets to be the star of the show
and we don't have to worry about making some kind of sauce to serve with it
okay we made that right along with the fish so i really am a huge fan of this
technique in fact this comes out so well you might
actually try to go buy a piece of salmon towel on purpose
but whether you do that intentionally or you just happen to get stuck with one
like me i really do hope you give this a try
