well well well if it isn't you fellas again we're back hey guys how you been done good I just flew in today so I got a little bit sick on the plane well I don't know if I'm like sick but you know I get those that plane sickness oh don't mind my sniffling every now and then I will mind it please don't tell me what to do and not to but also we knowwe from the mike every time i'd have to do it oh nice day but a very belated well briefly belated happy birthday thanks man yeah yeah just yesterday how many seven twenty seven twenty seven eight that's what that's my champagne birthday yes yeah I think that we like that you can now smoke I think it's yeah finally old enough that's awesome me congratulations that's great okay so what's that what's happening today we're doing something a little different we sure don't think we're watching the anime's butts really yeah if we're actually not we're watching a non anime show not technically anime it's called last man but I like it I like what I see and who are we to judge if you want to just watch two dudes on a couch I mean there are other shows to let you through that but yeah man that's we're gonna watch the show today so it's a watch along just keep in mind remember that we're not gonna show the show what a lot it's a watch to watch along there is a difference so hopefully you are smart enough to do that sign up I'll just read that I want to marry da mix that's a dope-ass comment well I am legal to smoke now apparently sorry yes it's wild enough to get married um no no marriage is 35 you're thinking of something else yeah yeah 35 is marriage 20 seconds you have to wait a little bit longer I'm sorry yeah but yeah man I am very very excited so tell me about what we're watching tonight so since it's not the animes you know people might not be familiar with what with why I'm not familiar actually I'm not sure what I'm getting into yeah I see a guy with boxing gloves I assume there's gonna be fighting in this yeah I think I think that's safe to say Don I think that's a fair assumption so last man is about a in a boxer guy owns a boxing gym but his best friend is murdered and so it's kind of a revenge story there's action there's violence I believe there's some supernatural stuff but also this whole show last then is as I understand it a prequel to the comic series of the same name it's like a I think it takes at least 10 years prior to so last Famicom so it's not like a direct adaptations just right you watch this and then you read the comic I believe that would be in chronological order the order but remember guys this is there are no subs there's nothing to read there's gonna be an interest so we're not gonna be just focusing on my screen we could actually I'm excited for that other thing it's gonna be nice to like a nice it is nice every once in a while I know I was just getting used to reading the Japanese as eventually I didn't need the jet the subs you know I could just understand damn what - you are nodding watashi wa Richard Aldina which is the main character of what we're watching yes yeah the little summaries who is Richard all all Damon's I said yeah it's how you pronounce it Richard Richard all Dana who is Richard all Dana a poor bastard who's the last man for the job you said it thank you watching his fight his way through hell in mando's new series last man cool also drink every time they say last man in the episodes but yes so just in case let's make sure you guys are all ready we're gonna start super soon I mean like really soon I know you guys have been waiting yeah I know but we're stalling so that you can sign up for your free 30-day trial of Verve and remember there are two ways to sign up just go to Verve Cove slash jacksFilms irv KO / tommix take your pick it's really all the same it doesn't matter to us just pick one and just along don't bring it up so we could watch oh yeah how many ads are in this how many commercial breaks do we go I believe there is a few roles who say you know as no commercial breaks not here on Verve that's why you sign up for the free trial no commercial breaks life's too short for commercials um alright without further ado what do you think boys are you ready I'm ready let's let's do this so how to see people will get murdered I guess I'm plot device we have a couch pink here this will be accurate there should be a counter here of where the timestamp is on the episode that we're watching yes yep the episodes I believe around 13 or so minutes so little short your usual 25 minutes right it'll be a little bit quicker but we'll take a break in between so you guys can catch up and you know let's this we could discuss how badly al Dana got his ass beat look at that thumbnail though yeah doesn't look too promising he doesn't look like a great fighter yet if that's what he's looking like I also have people on the comments get confused if they're like what are we doing what are they looking at I'm trusting you other people in the comments please catch them up to speed and go ahead dummy they're watching last minute more time you watch it very easy all right I think that's enough stalling episode 1 you're an [ __ ] al Dana that's the title of the episode I didn't work I did make it up that's real and you'll you know it too if you're signing up okay we're gonna sync it up we'll do a 3 2
