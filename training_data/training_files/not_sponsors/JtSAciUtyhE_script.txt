what is going on everybody we're here taking a look at the latest update 20/20 dot I don't even know 2020 that 16.2 dot one just got this there is actually another update floating around twenty Twenty twenty Twenty twenty twelve that's not out in mass yet but this one is going out to everybody so let's check out the new features I will put the release notes a picture on the screen for you so you can read those thank you to my newest patrons Glenn and John Christopher really appreciate that guys I did upgrade the camera so if there's any weirdness sorry I'm still kind of learning so looking at these release notes the Tesla toy box has been redesigned there is actually something really cool here that will look at nearby chargers you can now filter out slower Chargers if you want or if you're really desperate for a charge you can leave all available so you can just find whatever you need you can now format your USB Drive for Century mode which is huge because people would get these flash drives or their SD cards or SSDs and they wouldn't be able to set them up correctly it seems pretty easy but sometimes pull up problems and this is just a one-click easy solution and then backgammon has been improved if you're into that that's good I don't know how to play it and I tried and I had no idea what's going on all right so I have Stephanie and baby here helping me out so one of the new things in this release is that the animations of people on the screen are actually moving now instead of just like a stick figure kind of floating across the screen so she's gonna help us out I'm gonna get in the car put it in Drive and we're gonna see what that looks like alright so here's one of the parts I was most excited about I'd sees a car but she is walking around and you can see that the animation on here is actually moving and she's moving so can you come back and can you just stand there okay so Stephanie is gonna go walk in front of the car and alright it stopped there and she's gonna stop because I feel like okay so the animation does stop just like how she's stopping the animation is stopped so that's pretty cool okay you can back can you just walk backwards okay so it looks like it's walking forwards but alright that's cool and then yeah just come get baby yeah so that's pretty good it's just kind of it looks like a generic kind of walking animation like if it detects the person moving then they're walking that's all okay now we're gonna try it with the stroller earlier we were getting it looking like a motorcycle it was thinking the stroller was a motorcycle so there just shows one person pretty much ignoring the stroller but yeah it has that animation and then it stops it shows shows we're facing the car but oh there we go it corrected itself yeah that's pretty cool so babies looking all around nice yeah it just looks like you're moving fast yeah there's two of you now there's two of you no it just makes two of you it went away and came back it still thinks there's a person there really yeah yep yeah it's creepy you yeah nobody's over there that's really weird the one person is now just you moving no baby just you nope it looks like you're walking away then forward away then forward Thanks alright so I'm back I had to go for a minute it was bath time for that huge the code dirty Tesla to get 15% off alright so first up this is another one that I'm really excited about besides the walking around is the Tesla toy box so it used to be up here you'd click the T and then this would come down after you click the T or you could pull it down and I hated it it was so annoying every time I wanted to go in here and look at the release notes or something it would always come down and be getting in my way so I'm glad they moved it here now they had moved it here before but it's now redesigned and it's gone from a pair it's no longer up here which i think is great so you have all the apps here they look really nice and they have a little explanation now of what they do so if you don't know you know you can click we're on Mars transform your map to the surface of Mars it tells you what it does you can turn it on or off and there you go you can see in the background they got Santa spread holiday cheer around with Santa mode that's it and it tells you the voice command - that's pretty cool so we put that on and I love this graphic - it looks like that looks really nice so yeah you have all your things here okay so you can't turn this one on with the toggle you have to hit the stalk 4 times but it tells you how to do that so that's really nice ok so going into safety and security right here if we want to format our USB Drive you can go down to sentry mode again safety and security format USB device this is a new button I'm gonna click it just to see what happens and it gives you a warning are you sure you want to format this USB device and you can do that so it'll format it'll delete everything on whatever I like that they say USB device hopefully you're using either an SSD or a microSD card I will leave a link in the description for the micro sd card that I use from pure Tesla you actually don't even need this ability with a peer Tesla Drive that one you just plug in and it works but let's say you get like the samsung t5 SSD that's another really popular option you can plug that in just click format and then you're done it does it all for you which is great ok now we're in our nearby charging map and you can see here at the top we have new abilities here it actually has already automatically only selected two and three Chargers which are faster than one charger but if I click that it'll also show me some slower Chargers in case I want to see those I don't know why it's showing me Chargers that are so far away so you're most likely you're gonna want to keep it on these settings you're not gonna want to go to any of these slower Chargers but just in case you can click that and it keeps sending me over to Canada I don't know why it's doing that it obviously knows I'm over here it's very strange I don't know if this is working correctly I don't know why it's taking me this is all messed up it's only like showing me the options over here so it looks like the three Chargers are the hundred and fifty kilowatt super chargers is what it's showing me yeah so if we look at the Chargers with all three selected you can see hundred and fifty kilowatts are here if I get rid of the three it gets rid of all my 150 kilowatt options and it's showing a bunch of sixteen seventeen eight kilowatts but if I get rid of the one then you're getting a bunch of 72 kilowatt options these are Tesla Chargers of course the hundred fifty kilowatts are of course also Tesla Chargers and then these slow ones are going to be your third-party chargers alright and then why not let's just check out backgammon really quick even though I have no idea what I'm doing pretty much the same for me but you know what we can do we can put Tesla against Tesla so now the car is playing against itself and I'm sure the black side will win because I made it super but we'll see how it does I don't notice really anything different man the graphics are pretty amazing though again I only tried this once before but geez it looks like the weather it looks like it's real I hope you enjoyed this one I haven't had a chance to drive it yet because we're getting some cement pour it at the house and I can't get in the garage so I'm not really driving the car I could charge it with an extension cord but I've been driving our equinox with the shutdown and everything it's been kind of weird but let me know we think of the camera and everything I've been you know playing with that I hope it works really well for this and the audio is good and everything if you enjoyed please hit in the next video [Music]
