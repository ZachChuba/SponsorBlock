foodwishes.com with lace cookies that's right not only is this the easiest fancy cookie recipe i know it's also the fanciest easy cookie recipe i know and above and beyond being simple and gorgeous these florentine cookies as some people call them also keep pretty well which means they're perfect if you're looking for an idea for an edible holiday gift oh yeah i would like to get some of these but i'm not going to take any chances so i think i'll whip up a batch myself and to get started the first thing we're going to want to do is finely chop some almonds which yes you can do by hand but it's going to take a while so if we have a food processor let's go ahead and use that and normally with this kind of thing we pulse on and off until it's just like we want it but that actually doesn't work so well with whole almonds okay we still want to pulse on and off but in between the pulses we want to make sure it runs for a few seconds before we pulse again otherwise we're just sort of knocking the almonds around and they don't really start to chop up and while we do want these pieces really small we want to be careful not to go too far okay almond butter is delicious but it's not going to work very well in this recipe so what we're shooting for is something that looks like this and that's it we can just set those aside until needed and we can move on to what's going to be the base for the rest of this cookie batter and like so many great batters this batter begins with butter to which we will add some brown sugar as well as some light corn syrup or if you want instead some honey which is what you're going to see me use here and no matter which one you go with the procedure is going to be the same so it's really a matter of taste or if you love the taste of honey go with that but for something a little more mild and a little more neutral i go with the corn syrup but either way we'll go ahead and set our heat to medium and we'll wait for everything to melt and dissolve and if we want to give it a stir or two while that's happening go ahead but mostly what we're doing here besides stirring is waiting for this to come up to a boil because that's as far as we need to go so as soon as our mixture comes to a boil and hopefully looks a little something like this we will carefully remove that from the heat and proceed to add the rest of the ingredients which will include a little bit of real vanilla extract we will also need a small pinch of salt and then a surprisingly small amount of all-purpose flour oh yeah this is almost but not quite gluten-free then we'll take our whisk and mix this up until it's nice and smooth and then once that's been accomplished we can go ahead and transfer our finely chopped almonds and then we'll switch to a spatula and simply mix this until everything's combined and if you're wondering why we switched to the spatula you've never tried to do this with a whisk because basically the entire batter will end up inside the whisk which is not ideal and you'd have to use a spatula to clean it off anyway but anyway we'll go ahead and mix those almonds in as shown and believe it or not that's it our lace cookie batter or lace cookie dough if you prefer is ready to transfer onto a silpat lined baking sheet and two very important things to note here we're only using about two teaspoons of this stuff per cookie which ended up for me being exactly 15 grams if you want to be all scientific and the reason for the relatively small amount is because these really really spread out when they cook like a lot as you'll see which brings me to the second important thing we need a lot of space in between portions which is why i only do eight per pan and by the way the rounder and more uniform your portions are here the rounder and more uniform your cookies are going to be and what's great about this batter is as soon as it hits the pan and cools down it really firms up and the shape is very easy to fine tune and if need be reposition so i made sure those were all nice and evenly spaced and i didn't have too many random jagged edges and that's it once those have been panned up they are ready to transfer into the center of a 350 degree oven for about 10 to 12 minutes and i didn't show it but about halfway through if you want to rotate the pan to help them cook more evenly that's not a bad idea but anyway we'll cook those for about 10 minutes or until they look like this okay we're looking for a gorgeous golden brown that's just a little bit darker around the outside around the outside around the outside and then it's very important we let these cool before we try to do anything with them okay these cookies do not get crispy and crunchy until they're down to room temp and a great trick for making that happen faster would be to carefully slide the sill pad off the pan and off the towel so it's directly on your countertop and that's going to allow these to cool way faster in fact these were only sitting here for a few minutes before i shot this and as you'll see they've hardened up beautifully and are very easy at this point to peel off the silpat and also i'm going to show you here why they're called lace cookies because if they're done properly the light will actually shine through and it sort of kind of looks like lace so that was looking very nice and then what we'll do once our cookies are cool and crisp is take some melted dark chocolate and we will spread that over the flat side all right the side that was down on the pan and then once we have that spread with chocolate pretty much all the way to the edge we'll take another cookie and place that flat side down on the chocolate sandwiching it in between and by the way if you let your chocolate cool and get a little thicker and or you don't squeeze so hard you can actually avoid that chocolate squeezing up through the holes up to the surface but i actually think that looks good so while i don't want it squeezing out the sides i do like to give it a little bit of a press so i get a little bit of chocolate peekaboo action but anyway you decide i mean you guys are after all the bobby mcgees of how hard to squeeze and speaking of freedom just being another word for nothing left to lose feel free to do these with whatever kind of chocolate you want and or any other kind of nut you want okay michelle is partial to walnuts or maybe try something like macadamia which as you might know happens to pair perfectly with white chocolate so this simple technique really is very versatile and adaptable and of course you don't have to use any chocolate if you don't want to and i'm going to enjoy one just like this so you can hear how crisp and crunchy they are anyway if you did use the chocolate which i highly recommend you want to let them sit for at least an hour until that firms up before you serve them at which point they're ready to stack up and take some pictures of and while the plain one was very nice i really do prefer these with that layer of chocolate in between plus this way we get to eat two cookies at once so that works out nicely not to mention if you use a nice dark bittersweet chocolate i really think that helps balance what is a pretty sweet cookie which reminds me if you do use the honey these are gonna have a fairly pronounced sort of caramelized burnt honey flavor which i love as do many other people okay if you enjoyed our russian honey cake then definitely use the honey here otherwise if honey's not really your thing go with the corn syrup and as i said the technique will be exactly the same and as i mentioned if you're looking for a gorgeous and easy to make edible gift a stack of these in a box are tied up with a bow i think would be very much appreciated by any cookie lover on your list and yes i'm pretty sure i was supposed to use cellophane before tying the ribbon on but that's okay in the business we call that artistic license and if you are going to give these for gifts make sure you make a double batch because what will happen is you'll make them taste one and then eat the rest and then long story short that person ends up with a gift card and trust me they really would have preferred these cookies but anyway whether you're making these for a gift or for yourself or both i really do hope you give these a try soon so please
