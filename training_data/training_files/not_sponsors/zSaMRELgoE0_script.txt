baited the [ __ ] out of his shots here is what we established so far to start off this is our base on the map right here then there is the guys with a tower down in the water whom killed me in the beginning of the video and then we have the guys over here another set of roof campers who are now also considered our enemies oh and don't forget the other roof campers up towards Trainyard in the conclusion we are completely surrounded by well roof campers this is going to be a bit tough chapter three asserting dominance oh she's a bug by the water thing uh keep one of my hand he's ahead of that uh Southwest to thirty or two fifties I see him you just sitting there looking at me he's so smelly there's [ __ ] two are hiding in there with customs [ __ ] been suppressed [ __ ] oh my god

list Turner the net place on that all right that's going well it's not shut up use the naked the drastic it's probably out there he crashed just crashed it too because he's also had to run back I just heard him really alright boy sorry he's on the road he's on the road by the heli by the hell you brotherly clothes or hazmat hazmat yeah he was a belly I just lost a double girl the person is Jessica

same person all right looks like I was gonna say that word he you got my cleaver what how'd I not kill the guy good one what is happening they're back oh you hold an angle yeah I killed one hit the other one a bunch look outside I'm outside might be somebody they might come right us boys I think this might be a raid slow push him with the custom he's just holding he's holding the angle like he's out here somewhere he was tell you before sight that's him all right of course I said the guy's body we're sorry we're sorry yeah it's Buddha this is a [ __ ] that was roof kept me earlier from the compound John as soon as it turned day we took a run by their face we needed some information on it you need to know your enemies I love that so much do they have a scrap alley down there what are the TC stick it outside bring bricks me I swear to God I just it's open let me go see if it's unlocked first we have to break it we have to break it everything to make handmaids you see yeah dude that's so we can literally build a straight Taylor compound from that they have a large furnace going outside to stream it it oh my god I can get in no that might be a turret that my pits are it you almost killed me not the ones in the front got nothing ones in the front but yeah these these are often a parrot watching it right in front over here and if we get some bow and arrows we're gonna destroy it didn't wanna be here I thought they were online I have an idea I was gonna land on the other side of that wall spawning back at base I crafted a bunch of arrows to shoot out their turret can't do that dude [Music] [Music] till their corn you can get all the corn [Applause] Oh [Music] [ __ ] so I found the unicorn with a CC understand we got literally no resistance from them it's almost as if they logged off out of rage due to losing the gear test to us moments ago taking the advantage of that we took a run by orlag cargo ship along with doing some farming to make some major upgrades in our base now why am i fast-forwarding through all this well it's for the same reason why I woke up the next day having to start fresh because we got offline rated [Music] but hey it's just a bump on the road when has that ever stopped me chapter 4 the untold story [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] looks like they blew through the sides with rockets along with griefing US but they messed up on one thing they left my bag inside the base and I had some ideas [Music] look at who it is [Music] but so here's the thing they so they went through the side so they spent they spent 20 almost 30 Rockets going to the side they set up a raid based on everything but they didn't get past the armored door to where my bag is so I'm literally spawning I've been spawning in the bag and I've been having the flame trap destroy the wood so I can get out of the bunker can sprout the front door yeah the guys in the water here is where things get interesting though I spawned outside to take a look into the base once more and then as I looked up I spotted an airdrop landing right next to our base oh my god that's literally landing right here please don't have anybody come those guys coming with the little bow I think to the 1:45 I see I got him I got him get that airdrop we got to see four out of it all right all right where we don't chemicals in the drops at least do we got a c4 out of it [Music] where they live they live yep yeah water away all right cool thank you let me know if you got to use the c-4 to our advantage okay so here's the thing though they when I spawn on the beach they literally shot me in a head with a ball tee do you know what kind of explosives they used by the way did they use like rockets or something they used rocket launcher they read it through the window yes they were that scare that scared wow that's actually insane to me dude no way [Laughter] since that's that's insane you know should we invite them to the team I'm gonna be honest I think we should do you want to join us we're gonna try to get this back they left my bag inside but there's a flame trap watching it so I've been trying to play our drain now have absolute confirmation that the people who offline rated us where the tower campers down in the water it also seemed like this guy had the same goals as us so we invited him along our journey of revenge quickly I stashed our weapons and got back to work chapter 5 rebuilding [Music] oh my god okay I live at five-thirty Nels hi hello you see if you can like toss it into the window maybe I can grab it yes that's highly unfortunate my bag of destroyed no it did it's still there Thanks I'm coming I'm just gonna go grab the ladder match and whatnot I successfully broke the bunker using the flame trap spawning back inside Jay started those Spears and so I could start breaking the walls I grieved our front door I can break it I don't think it has any Emma actually does it has ammo I'm sorry chakra trap imagine this beer killed me [Music] freaking eat this up are you kidding me right now what I've always wanted to eat you my guy ain't cool Thank You expand appreciate the seafloor real quick please have this on here please hesitancy here yes we've I can get enough all right well I'll come grab [Music] although we successfully got our bass back there will most likely be some resistance we need to stay vigilant hey open your front door there were two there were two I got a double barrel yeah come here oh wait I thought there was like a group of five but there is we got accustomed to I got the customer down in the right a middle go away if you guys need some spearmen help help right now do that they might have they might have left to go get more explosives I'm gonna be honest chief we could we wipe all that the back there back I got it [ __ ] I'm dead though here's the inventory full of [ __ ] there I'm spawning in Russia grab the double I have custom so here's an immature [ __ ] is right here no oh explosive ammo they're gonna raid us again I got full metal gear set I can GL look over JJ look more shelves for my DB and I'm putting this our way okay we're right there that's all right I called the bunch Thursday I got it I can rec Chloe yeah I have the back of it I got no they okay boys successfully defending against attackers we finished up the job and fully cleaned the bases ours once again but just real quick there is a few second portion that I skipped out on well till now backtrack into when I was trying to break our bunker with a flange trap I heard some shots nearby while waiting on my bag timer of course I went to investigate when I came across a group of gear guys killing Nick is down on the beach I tried my best to help them out but was way too under gear and there I couldn't kill them so easily you guys feel better about yourselves why I bring this up well I just so happen to remember that after claiming our base so I took a run over that to see if I can catch them in the act once more also try not to forget about the tower campers down in the water as their story isn't finished quite yet chapter 6 a process yeah buddy go grab that against now I have a gun that's me finding them come on Bernie or are they shooting at you from the mountain no down below on the mountain - I had one one low I'm headshot boys very close I'll hit him there's a guy coming up behind us there's two of them the sumo oh I'm freaking it just to hold it good dead nice rocks I push it up I'm moving just milita's body I got me what the [ __ ] was that Ellie exploding I think this guy had so much [ __ ] dude come here get his body I don't think I flew dude I think you had two stars we just got stood Oh cut them double headshot him yeah Thompson hmm zip locks not necessarily NEMA have seen very often but when taking a closer look on one of his teammates bodies you will see a very familiar name a name that has been on my target list and spotting them killing nakeds on the coast and as we very quickly discovered he's also part of the group that roof campus early on in a story all thanks to our buddy ziplocs here for coming straight from the compound with yet another gear set it's the guys it's the guys from over there and then 21 or not n 2014 oh and guess what they found out where we live like my p2 skills are so off right now Oh God calls it please they're gonna come nice work looks like he's solo dude are you guys are all the way back there again Archer yeah we took this as a sign of an all-out war it was us versus roof campers because as it seemed both groups had a no rate agreement of some sorts considering not even 12 hours until our time on the server we were offline rated it was our turn to hit back but first we needed to go through the process [Music] I am economy that we're good I don't anyway okay let's see more I suppose [Music] space-time space-time [Music] Oh what do we do I killed my first heavies catapulting you're on Le paddock where where is don't see him oh I see him oh that's gonna they're gonna haunt you so that was the last one we got a crossbow we hit a crossbow you got a crossbow yeah [Music] like things that she does like when she talks can I take that mp5 shortly after our run we thought was a good idea to fly into our enemy's compound and try to blow into their furnace base and what we discover was rather intriguing by the way I want to go into the furnace Oh actually no why would they have that fridge this is maritime ammo I was mad as a box yeah alright let's go right here absolutely add lights everyone in the debate one second well then lift her garage door open dude they're idiots yeah all OH what a tease Burling this box oh that's that's that's [ __ ] up it was very odd and almost nothing of value in there besides a bulky with a scope and a metal face mask that Gillan found being the spawn on the ground first we completely ignored it but after a long day of hitting up rig cargo ship military tunnels and even get into some fights we decided to take one more look into the compound once again okay I did this fun you literally made them leave the server their base was the king it kind of explains to why we found such valuable items on the ground because they despond everything and just as confirmation we came back one last time later that day [Music] I'm inside of the base it's literally like I just want you guys oh is it the king yeah yeah damn they really couldn't handle well I guess there's only one last thing to do it's time to close up their chapter like we don't have to get into this all right all right not even trippin bro [Music] that's unfortunate that's probably too high I might even behind you have it was like five now there is three [Music] [Music] perfect oh [ __ ] are you doing [Music] [Applause] we gotta go oh okay that wasn't you that's disgusting shooting it was two of them on the roof - they're both on the roof naked with a case I see I see Allah I stick and CLR a guy he's he's only a cop again I can headshot on the column whoa whoa whoa slow ero bucko this is not day three this is still back and day two this is actually just a little show-and-tell to why we are about to raid these guys we have dedicated all of our time and effort into rating and getting rid of roof campers although they didn't necessarily do it towards us after all they were in the vicinity of the area we are trying to cleanse so after discovering them we headed home made a few upgrades did some crafting and then call the MA on day two and now well now we're on day three on top of their roof ready to blow [ __ ] up is it's a 5g else everyone back up because it's gonna hurt like a sumbitch [Music] [Music] [Music] we're gonna move out the rocket nice family and then back up like rocket come to me and I'll walk oh my god I've never seen this many boxes before I mean there's a [ __ ] ton components right here all that cloth okay there's a almost 20 explosives in here little bit of gunpowder and sulfur so many of them so there's two launches out here two on the right TC okay I mean the bad then craft some more explosives are quick I guess let's grab what we want and leave and he'll there any other base oh my god Jesus turn [ __ ] bird who's coming with let's just drop off and come back making a few trips back and forth removes everything of value back to our base then I gathered every single last piece of gunpowder and sulfur crafted two rockets for our final hoorah here was the thing we wanted this raid to be an online raid so while waiting for at least one of them to get on we ran over and shut out one of their turrets to make it a little bit easier on us then moments later we spotted one of them moving around inside quickly we headed home a grabbed all of our rating tools it was time to end this once and for all [Music] [Music] one by one I dropped us in the compound no raid base no bags are we so planning on right there I'm gonna show this barricade this is going hey remember that nigga's real can't the other day yeah what's up man how you doing it's good to see ya alright boys as soon as that breaks let me in hey what's up oh my god a box of metal
