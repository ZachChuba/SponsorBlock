hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with Hungarian potato and sausage sooo that's right when the going gets
tough the tough makes soup and while pretty much all soups would be
considered comfort food with only a few exceptions sorry gazpacho there are
certain recipes that comfort the body mind and soul and even a more profound
way and this amazingly delicious and hearty soup is in that class so with
that let's go ahead get started by adding a nice big hunk of butter to this
soup pot placed over medium heat and yes olive oil would work if you want to make
this animal free and then once that melts we'll go ahead Brown up some
Hungarian sausage which we've sliced into rounds or if we can't find
Hungarian sausage a sausage we can find from a country as close to Hungary as
possible which for me was Poland so I'm using some beautifully smoky pork Polish
sausage but really for a soup like this pretty much any sausage will work so
that will be up to you I mean you are after all the goose
Gossage of how to use sausage and what we'll do is cook this stirring for a few
minutes or until it's lightly browned and if you want you could just stir this
and not worry if each side is getting a perfect browning but if you're really
into it and that kind of stuff bothers could take the time to flip
these pieces over individually which I did to a few until I lost interest and
decided that was not a big deal but anyway like I said we'll go ahead and
cook that stirring until lightly browned at which point we will remove tool Bowl
with a slotted spoon leaving behind what's basically a sausage infused
butter and by the way protip if you know you're gonna remove sausage from a pot
with a slotted spoon just start with a slotted spoon and use that to stir it
while it cooks see because now I have to wash two spoons which is unfortunate but
anyway we'll go ahead and remove that and reserve it until needed at which
point we will toss a diced onion into that gloriously flavored fat along with
a nice big pinch of salt and we will cook those stirring still on medium heat
until they just start to turn translucent and even though it kind of
looks like it we're not really browning these see what's happened is the salt is
drama moisture out of the onion which is deglaze those caramelized meat juices
from the bottom of the pan giving it this fairly well browned appearance so
I'm just pointing that out so you don't think you have to cook these for a long
time until they get browned and then what we'll do once our onions
do turn translucent and start to soften is stir in a couple tablespoons of flour
which by the way is a little bit unusual for a potato soup
okay generally we'll just mash or crush or puree some of the potatoes in when
it's done and use that to thicken it but this time we're not going to all right
we're gonna leave our potato cubes intact and rely on this a little bit of
flour to help give the soup its body so we'll go ahead and cook that flour
stirring for about two or three minutes at which point we will add some minced
garlic and a nice big spoon of Hungarian paprika or any paprika all right I think
everyone would agree that Spanish paprika would work just as well but
regardless once that's in there we'll go ahead and cook that stirring for just
about one minute all right just basically to take the ride off the
garlic and we don't want to go too long because if we happen to burn that
paprika we will ruin the soup so like I said just about a minute or so should be
perfect and then once that set we can go ahead and pour in our chicken broth and
give that all a nice stir well at the same time raising our heat to high and
we're doing that of course because we want this to come up to a simmer and
while that happens because this does have flour in it we do want to give it
the occasional stir to make sure none of that is sticking to the bottom and
forming lumps which it most likely will not be but do it anyway
all right half the fun to make it a homemade soup it's turned in once in a
while and then what we'll do once this does come to a simmer is toss in the
secret ingredients a couple cups of chopped green cabbage and if you can try
to get all of it in the pot and we will stir that in and let it cook for about
two minutes or until it just loses its stiffness and by the way even if you
don't think you like cabbage be sure to add it to this all right when you simmer
cabbage in a soup like this it gets beautifully sweet and really helps
elevate all the other ingredients so that's what I did and a few minutes
later my pot looked like this and at this point we can add a couple large
russet potatoes that we peeled and cut into cubes and please know you can cut
your potatoes into any size you want but there are two things you should consider
all right number one the pieces should be small enough to fit on a soup spoon
and then also they should all be about the same size and that's just so they
all get soft and tender in about the same amount of time so we will stir
those in and then wait for this come back to a simmer and while we're waiting
for that we can add the rest of our seasonings which will be some fresh
the ground black pepper some cayenne + 1 bay leaf + if you think it needs it and
I did another splash of broth or water and obviously that will depend on how
thick you want your soup and you can if you want just add it later once you see
how things are going since that is just you cooking but I felt like I needed
another little splash so I added it now and then what we'll do once all those
tough decisions have been made and our soups come back to a simmer is we will
give that a stir and then lower our heat to medium low and we'll let that simmer
for about 30 minutes stirring occasionally or until our potatoes are
very very soft and tender and if you're not sure go ahead and try to smash one
against the side of the pot and if it easily matches you're done but if it
doesn't you're not so let it cook and that's it once our taters are tender
we'll go ahead and stir our sausage back in and then once that's been
accomplished we will add the other secret ingredient and that would be a
couple tablespoons of white distilled vinegar which is generally what we add
when we want to increase the acidity of a dish without adding any additional
flavors but having said that some apple cider vinegar would work or maybe a
white wine vinegar but no matter what you use once that stirred in we will
simply let this simmer for another 10 minutes and that's it our Hungarian
potato and sausage soup is done as soon as we check her for salt alright I know
we put some in earlier Bob potatoes soups are famous for needing more salt
so I gave mine a taste and it did so I stirred in a little more and of course
that will depend on how salty your sausage is which is why we don't add a
lot earlier but once it's done you always want to taste and adjust and
we'll give it one last taste to make sure and as soon as you love it we can
go ahead and turn off the heat and grab a ladle and serve this up and as you can
see even though we didn't mash or puree any of the potatoes in that little bit
of flour actually thicken this up beautifully and of course some of the
smaller pieces of potato will fall apart and add a little bit of additional
starchiness to this but the vast majority of those potato cubes are
intact and at this point we can go ahead and serve it up and then to finish this
properly we have two we must garnish the top with some sour
cream and not just a little all right I'm gonna go ahead and put on - nice
dollops okay if you're not slightly embarrassed by
what you're putting on it's probably not enough and then for a final touch we can
do some sliced green onions or chives or parsley or dill they all would be fine
and then I finished up with one last shake of cayenne and that's it I'm gonna
go ahead and grab a spoon and dig in and above and beyond being an incredibly
Hardy and comforting this is just an incredibly delicious and flavorful soup
okay we have the obvious savoriness from our sausage but also we have that earthy
sweetness from the onions and the cabbage balanced perfectly and elevated
by that little splash of vinegar and the sour cream and of course making all this
possible are soft and tender potatoes so I really do absolutely love everything
about this and probably the only way this gets any better would be eating
this with a nice big hunk of crusty buttered bread so if you're on one of
these new trendy high carb diets give that a try otherwise feel free to enjoy
this as is and I think you'll agree it's one of the best soups you've had in a
long time so for all those reasons and more I really do hope you give this a
try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient amongst a
principle written recipe and much more info as usual and as always enjoy
