it's been far far too long welcome we're burnin gentlemen back to the most epic series of all time the biggest flexes in anime 16 if you want to be as flexes an anime 17 to come out within a week well then all you have to do is smash like because 70,000 likes and that will happen if not it will be whenever I so desire so now with the obvious necessary like requirement goal thingy out of the way I have some pretty top-tier flexes hahaha and I am looking forward to sharing it with you hope you're ready for some epic Mindfreak flexes because that's definitely where we're starting off this video is sponsored by crossing void global and more on that later first we'll be talking about Annelle from one piece and now top tier mad LED right here the guy lives on the sky island raining lightning boats down to the point that yes I'm just gonna get to the meat and potatoes of the epicness of this flex he's such a huge flexor that he gets the people that inhabit the sky islands to think he's God you know g.od God like the omit misen being thing yeah that's what he gets people to believe he is immediately a master flex and a flex that pretty much cannot even be topped by anything you can imagine he just lives in his little palace place type thing go with those massive earlobes that you can't even make fun of her I'll turn you to ash and whatever anyone anywhere within his domain does anything to defy his righteous judgment he will rain down lightning and annihilate their faces and everyone knows this and everyone knows there's nothing they could do about it must be that NL is a god and also mad respect to NL because uh each straight-out flat-out says yeah I do it cuz I'm a god the guy's earlobes a slide for the fact that you can't make fun of them or I'll turn you into a pile of ash and thou could also hear anything that goes on anywhere to Rayna these lightning bolts upon people to flex on them further when NL is actually finally beaten he ends up going to subjugate of the moon he's like I I want us to go higher up anyway goes to the moon takes over has like control of all these weird robot playthings the mad lad doesn't even have a bounty because you know the world government never heard of him because if they would have you know he may have dropped righteous judgment on their asses he just kind of sits and does his own thing at all time and even while doing his own thing he is an absolute terror we're definitely gonna see him again I mean him being on the moon that's a major plot point some might even think the one piece is on the move or maybe it even is the moon I wonder if anyone ever did a very awesome one piece theory on that well if someone did it would definitely be leaked in the description and it was also me boilers and those entire existence is fascinating to at that point in the one piece series you had Luffy and the crew bumping into warlords finally learning a little bit about yonk oh they hear about how ace is chasing black beards they learn about the world government in the Marines they're mixed up in all of his wacky shoes and then their entire world gets flipped upside down when they go to sky island and meet the ultimate terror of a now that they'd only be literally because of Pokemon type advantages he was so badass he wasn't even beaten by being overpowered he was beaten because he was literally up against a rubber boy that his lightning didn't affect he was beaten by sheer dumb luck because that's the only way to get rid of geo dnl now there's another flex in regards to now and it wasn't exactly done by NL but it was definitely done through an L and an L was definitely the top dog in this situation and I know it's not gonna get its own mention on the entire mass of glorious series of the biggest flexes in anime but when Sanjay gets fried BAE and L and Sanji's holding a cigarette and he was like even though he was burnt to a crisp saying to NL thanks I needed a light and then takes a puff of smoke from the cigarette that was charred by the lightning strike I think that flex was huge massive on Sanji's behalf even though he was just annihilated in two seconds by an L and to all of you saying Nucks it's actually pronounced Andrew because that's what the dub said all right well time to get flex done by Lorde next Inori it's called Anna ruins dub because Japanese people for them most part cannot pronounce the letter L and pronounce it is new so it's n n you like Zhou la dude oh that's right it's an L the dub was wrong sorry fam just had to flex on you there and this is also a mind freak flex from the legendary second mizukage from Naruto I wanted to talk about this for the longest goddamn time I'm so glad that finally episode 16 of the biggest flex is an anime reared its ugly head allowing me to finally talk about this absolute beast so as far as the great ninja war goes we got to learn about a ton of ancient tag a the right cog a the third one that is the second sushi guy gave we got to see all the hokages come back but there's one cog a in particular there really does not get enough credit and that one is the second mizukage it's the weird-looking dude that summons this massive shell thing that casts can jutsu on people for those of you don't know genjutsu in the naruto verse is this absolutely broken finger that no one uses except people of showering guns and the only people that do use it like ger and i uses it on someone with the Sharingan like Itachi and gets counter bodied by genjutsu genjutsu is only useful by showering on people for like one second by Jiraiya against pain with help of the toad fam which kind of look like baby Yoda and the second mizukage now while the Third Reich AG it was fighting like I don't know Naruto clone and the second sushi guy he was fighting like the third to Chicago and Darrow was fighting the previous Kaz a cog a the second mizukage really didn't get any hype because he was just fighting normies all the normies that modulator bodies gathers around him and they're like throwing kunai inches and they can't do anything to the guy second mizukage does not get any credit because of this the Aven dave gain KQ and schminke ku more screen time fighting dowry then they gave the second mizukage which is so sad cuz this personality is just straight fire and glorious this man inadvertently casts a genjutsu so powerful all the people around him cannot do anything now this is probably the reason why they didn't put him in any major fights it wouldn't have exactly been the flashiest to battles it is just you know one with genjutsu and here is the biggest flex of all the fact that he's annihilating all these ninja and at the same time that he's doing that being that his motions are being controlled but his mind is not he's explaining to them how to beat him he's saying okay that's gonna be an illusion I'm over here actually yes don't do this you're gonna end up attacking each other and even though he's explaining all this stuff to everyone hoping that they'll defeat him they just can't he's dead jutsu and even straight-up ninjutsu are way too powerful the guy's annihilating hundreds of shinobi while trying to explain to them exactly what to do to beat him the guy's even better he's like alright there's this one technique that it's like my total weakness I don't really want to tell you cuz I want to be like remembered by history as this really cool guy who even though I was trying to tell you how to stop me you still weren't able to okay that's hilarious and then he proceeds to tell them anyway and he tells them every goddamn step of the way how to take him down and they just came and the funniest thing is and what really makes this a flex is that he is internally loving it he's like I I know that for the sake of this shinobi wild it's much better if you defeat me so I'm gonna do my best to help you beat me but also I'm kind of happy that you can't send up annihilating all you young ones Loki a huge flex and I love the second music a game even though it barely got any screen time its these bits of Naruto lore that makes the show so goddamn great easily one of my highlights of the war our next max Isaiah OD ha da from doo da da da so straight up Isaiah is one of my favorite anime characters of all time he was like really high in my top hundred list that I just dropped a couple days ago and he got damn deserves it I love these over thought-out sinister and smug psychos so much not just because of the flexes but well the flexes definitely helped in a previous flex video I talked about Shizuo heiwa Jima and why he flexes so well I mean geez well as the guy that rips up street signs to use his baseball bats and throws cars and vending Jeanne's at his opponents to try and take them down but the real reason why I think Shizuo was such a fantastic flexor is because in the city of ekabo karo which is the hub of nut sews which is secretly wide urs freakin awesome you have all these ridiculous games you have the yellow scarves and the blue squares and the dollars is which is like the secret fricking game thing there's also like do different KGB squads hidden undercover in there there's like madness scientist OHS and doula Hans I can keep going the amount of badass ridiculousness that goes on in Iike bucardo is astounding whether its natural or supernatural and that said and done even though there's all that wacky shiz going on the one guy that everyone says stay away from his Shizuo hey wa Jima this random guy who's just somehow really strong he's not part of a gang he's not part of a mafia he's not part of the KGB and he's not supernatural in any way he's just freaking rip and everyone's terrified of it he is the only person that commands this level of fear and awe from every other be whether alive or undead you have mind-controlling sword armies okay and they're scared to scheisse of Shizuo now the only person that isn't scared of Shizuo he's IOT hada he's the guy that picks a fight with she's or whatever he gets the chance cuz she's will could swing around any street sign he wants and he's I'll just deftly dodge around it enjoying the chaos getting spread by she's ROS rampage and just reveling in the twister of disaster that is following him throughout the city well I kind of see why I like him now hmm very suspicious it's almost like I also kind of like reveling in chaos you something must be a coincidence the beauty of the chaos in Ikebukuro even aside from cheese is that since there's so much going on everyone has questions and everyone's looking for something whether it's the mind controlling swords art the freakin KGB or the dollars or all these hidden mafia leaders that are mixed throughout the general populace these ridiculous psycho biker police officers with this undead dullahan motorcycle rider everyone has an objective everyone's looking for something and trying to find something out and no one knows how to go about it it causes this massive chaos to the point that in the first season were introduced to three protagonists as main protagonists I mean I can say the city ekabo kiddo the protagonist have do it out of that but the three main characters were introduced to are just kind of friends in school and then it turns out each of them is the leader of some crazy underground organization that's unbelievable in their own way everyone is looking for answers and no one has any of them except for Izaya or tijada iord of conventional jobs before you know assassins hitmen mercenaries all that stuff that's like old school stuff Isaiah makes a living by being an information broker he will give you info that you need if you give him something that is more valuable - because this guy just likes watching the chaos he flexes on Zawadi though and everyone in the city knows he's AI Orianna he's the guy everyone knows no one trusts and everyone knows that they could get what they need if they go to him but they'll end up giving up something way too important to do it my favorite flex of his I if I had to pinpoint one exactly as opposed to the very nature of his character he gets kidnapped by this group and they have like a bag over his head and he set it up in the way that they end up getting into this whole argument if perhaps the guy that they kidnap wasn't actually he's aya and they're all like losing their mind trying to figure it out they eventually unmask him and to find out it actually was Izaya but it turned out Isaiah planned for them to capture him and stall that amount of time for Isaiah's ragtag band of psycho badasses to show up take the entire gang that captured him and make out with all the stuff that he wanted to get from them no one messes with Isaiah orihara except for the fact that he gets punched at the end of every single season of Darrell just to let you know that yeah there's more chaos brewing but aside from all of that this man is the greatest flexor in the city and well one of my favorite anime characters of all time if you can't tell yet I highly recommend the series du da da da it's a great show and it's from Isana from Sudan Iranian alright so I was originally considering talking about the epic flexes as Anna does when do you know analysis ation she finds this extremely top-secret army base and manages to infiltrate and force them to obey to her winds and stuff yeah that was pretty epic I just thought that I didn't want to talk about a massive flex that made no sense according to the overall plot of the story so I wanted to talk about older asana flexes because hell yeah let's do this I always have to have one of these flexes basically as a member of the anime community when sword art online actually began airing I want to say member I mean someone that watched anime I didn't have a channel at that point but it was really fun to see the community take and how everyone loved sorted online when it first began when this thing started the community was on fire and one of the things that a lot of people loved about Sao when it first started was asthma because when Asuna was introduced if you remember she was a goddamn interesting character they introduced her as this girl who was always alone didn't really know what she was doing in the game Kirito partners up with her because let's be honest she makes his sword go online and then it turns out she is pretty badass after all she had a very distinct personality that was given to her in Episode two of sorted online and they say in Episode two because that interesting personality was immediately replaced with being a generic tsundere at first she hated Kirito because he was traveling alone and stuff and then she was like oh my god I actually realized that here Ito is the goddamn coolest piece of swordsmen at the face of this server and she proceeded to flex on the entire fandom when everyone realized that yeah she was just your typical plain old sorry fan that said and done I am in fact including Asuna to this list because I believe her Flex was on a much more meta level now I don't really get the chance to talk about something like this all this much and I do believe to a certain extent she did flex on the anime community not because oh at first we thought she was an interesting character then actually no she's boring now that's not really what I'm trying to say I'm saying that I believe the actual romance elements to the first 15 episodes of sword art online was actually great I think Asuna freaking did a wonderful job being the character that she was supposed to be I liked the idea that she was so respected there needed to be this curry deal bastard following her around that Kirito proceeded to flex on and then when that guy tried to kill Kirito she ended up showing up at the nick of time to kill him not to mention that even though everyone who likes ordered online likes to constantly mention out oh yes cutie joke most manly badass guy ever this guy he has like two swords and he's probably epic and and everyone should respect him and stuff but let's be honest Asuna wore the pants in the family absolutely said let's adopt this ridiculous looking child that shouldn't really be here they adopted the addictions lucky Jabba the Jaden be here I said I wanted here you know to do something she would threaten him with a butter knife and he would listen i Cineflex on the nights of the blood oath when she was like see a fam I'm going along with hubby even though she had such a ridiculously high position and then she proceeded to flex unhappy becoming the matriarch of the relationship yes sir flex is definitely kind of degraded as the seasons continued but I think in the first enclosed 15 episodes of sword art online asana did her role amazingly she pulled off a great female lead and yeah maybe this wasn't even a stint of flexing maybe this is just a ploy duck Senora flexing on the YouTube community that liked hating on si oh I don't even know at this point let me know in the comments what you think it definitely because don't you want biggest lecture 17 to come out sooner I mean duh but now for free on iOS or Android and with that said thanks for sponsoring and next let's from the legendary food imagine Attica be stupid which is the only correct way to pronounce this full metal alchemist brother I almost can't even say it it's disgusting we got one of the best girls ever Olivia Armstrong okay we all knew that she would make it to the biggest flexes in anime at some point and welcome to the biggest flexes in anime 16 where finally we get to talk about Olivia now I think when most people think of Olivia's massive flexes it's the fact that even though she's not an alchemist everyone's terrified of her also the name of her fort is fort brakes and I don't know many bigger flexors than Briggs from all day anime yeah that's probably on second thought not what most people consider to be your biggest flexes but it's definitely very cool she walks around with his sword and she proceeds to flex on every she leads an invasion into the capital from her little fort and she takes over the fact that her brother Alex Louis Armstrong the guy that's literally as opposed to just metaphorically flexing on everything and everyone with those twinkly shiny things everywhere he's terrified of her they get into a little squabble at one point and she beats the living snot out of the guy she flexes constantly on everyone just by her charisma alone as opposed to just straight up being one of the best fighters in the series even though she doesn't use out me in my personal opinion though her biggest flex is when there's this super high ranking officer in the EMES trous government that sankt her oh you're actually an amazing general I am a huge fan of you and stuff and uh wink wink since the core members of the central government are actually secretly corrupt and working on get immortality' you can uh you know be corrupt along with us and also get immortality that would be pretty epic and he proceeds to explain to how the foundation of the entire country is corrupt in this way and they selected her to be a part of the inner circle to which she says no you don't understand you will be the foundation of this then she proceeds to pick him up and throw him into a vat of cement that they are in middle of cementing a floor that was just destroyed by a previous attack on port bridge BAM she had the greatest pun of all time she literally made this guy the foundation of the country she was offered immortality and she flexed on that idea flexed on his own wording through him to slowly drown in cement all in front of all of her officers knowing with her extreme charisma all of her soldiers would continue to follow her even though she just you know kind of commit massive treason by killing a super high ranking official guy from the government but still she was so certain that even after killing this official all of her people would still follow her wholeheartedly and then you know she turned him into the foundation of the country which again I think that's hilarious personally I don't know maybe you have a bit of a sadist but goddamn Olivia this was the biggest flex ever so glad you could make it for the biggest flexes in anime 16 I feel bad that they can't you know make this video like four hours long so they have so many more flexes I want to talk about so definitely smash that like button so I could talk about them sooner debby dexplex our lovely main weapon from bludgeoning angel Kukoc ah all right so most people don't know what this is probably because it's like an old anime and stuff and that's perfectly fine I'm glad crossing points around and if this isn't crossing void because I get to talk about an anime that I probably otherwise wouldn't have even thought of the document the story about this dude who you know make friends with angel ramen who is busty like most angels should be and she has this very terrifying massive spiked mace now I feel like any examples of the show that I actually talked about will only spoil the moments themselves because some of the moments in bludgeoning angel are gold whenever he annoys her or does something for whatever reason she'll bludgeon him this terrifying bad thing turning him into a pile of mulch and then she be like oh I'm sorry about that and then like bring him back to life to be totally funny he ends up so traumatized by this ridiculous cycle of events that continuously happens again and again and again I mean accidentally like flush him down a drain after he's turned to mulch by one of her massive bats wings and well you know there's a lot of ecchi in there because well that's a good reason to get her annoyed and what she gets annoyed she bludgeoned him and she's annoyed cos he peeks at her edginess do you see the cycle that were working with here it's a total gag anime and before I actually recommend this anime to you because that's not exactly what I'm doing here watch some clips of it on YouTube if you find it hilarious well then pick up the show but it's not a humor that's for everyone as she proceeds to flex on him for you know like 12 episodes straight like legit straight up and it just gets more and more wacky as she finds different ways to annihilate him and then feel bad so if she brings it back to life and then more angels come and then they flex on each other and then they kill him and like the cross wind of different battles Anila all sorry about those bring you back to life I don't know I find it funny tickles my funny bone sometimes it's not one of my favorite comedies cuz it's not exactly my thing but I definitely appreciate the flexes next and this one is from hunter hunter so I've mentioned flexes in Hunter hunter before in fact I've mentioned one that had to do with ovo getting the biggest flexes of anime to image and how qurupeco brought a shovel to fight over knowing that he would win and then need to bury a corpse which is relatively somber but also a huge flex and definitely needed to be reminded to everyone but as far as you Vogon goes he himself has quite the flexes too for a while in New York New York they are hyping up this mafia to be so badass everyone should be afraid of this mafia and the top 12 guys in the Mafia they're 12 shadow beasts now they have such a cool name it's like you know the Akatsuki the shadow beasts both terrifying I would argue shadow beasts are actually even scarier but then when they're introduced they have such fodder for the Phantom troupe that's not oh no one remembers them with all at all when new Bugan first gets attacked he's paralyzed from the neck and he still says to his guys don't help me I still got this and those guys were like yeah obviously we're not gonna help you why would we waste their time you deal with it let me let me uh recontextualize this for you for a second the guy's paralyzed yeah paralyzed like can't move from the neck down right for most of you that don't know that's like most of his body aside from his head and he still win he yells so loud it bursts his opponents eardrums an enemy gets close so he bites a chunk of his skull out and then spits it like a bullet to kill another guy these are the shadow beasts the really hype guys and as much as I appreciate the bogan flexes that he's so certain he's gonna win even though he's paralyzed from the neck down I'd argue that the bigger flexes are from the rest of the phantom troupe but don't even think that they should bother helping the guy that's paralyzed from the neck down and it's not that they don't care about it when well tragedy befalls Porou Vogon they're like all sad and stuff they care about the guy but this isn't even considered a dangerous situation for him that's how certain they are that they're stronger than this extremely hyped up evil organization that is a huge plex next legs because honestly I could talk a lot more about the whole phantom troop flexing thing but you know different members of the fandom trip really deserve time to shine on different episodes of the biggest Lexa's in anime and i want to lump them all together as this one huge flakes on how this is so much stronger than everyone else and they know it and you know they're not afraid to show it but for the final flex of this video I wanted to talk about an anime series again that I don't think a lot of you have seen and based on the title you'll definitely know it's a light novel and you thought there's never a girl online so I'm gonna be straightforward with you guys I mentioned Oh kudo chan you know the bludgeoning angel in the past and well that's not my type of comedy this is I left my butt off from just episode one of and you thought there's never a girl online and I love flexes in comedy anime because they're not necessarily as somber and deep as you know NL who gets people to think he's God or the second mizukage is you know trying to convince people and tell them ways to beat him and they still kid or even just the sheer force of the Phantom troupe this is on a much smaller scale and definitely a funnier one so story of n you thought there's never a girl online is about this dude who's playing an MMORPG and he is like three close friends that he's made on the MMORPG there's one that's kind of like his internet waifu and there's a lot to like about this show just from the setup alone we all love stories about people that are trapped in an MMORPG dun dun Indonesian people that are playing an MMORPG and you know being skeptical about who they're actually meeting the whole time that he has his online girlfriend and whatever he's thinking himself alright I'm gonna play this out even though it's probably a dude because you know no girls play MMORPG and in this squad of four he ends up somehow finding out when they make a real life meeting that all three of the people of his squad are hot girls from his own school and well this is just this setup alone you have to see it that's at least watch episode one and see if you enjoy it because as surprised as he is that that's the case the girls are even more surprised he got your once under 8 he got your one well very provocative one and then you got the one that's actually the supposed to love from the online game and she's just like totally wacky shut-in and she flexes on him trying to show how much she loves him in real life as well and he's in the beginning you know kind of not sure about it but his dude senses get to him and he ends up somehow okay with it you know his sword goes online the different girls are trying to out flex each other even the tsundere somehow you know is it's under and ends up liking him and he's inadvertently flexing on the entire school how did he get such a goddamn bad ass harem of the most popular Goyal's and you thought there's never a girl online is also in crossing void and I'm so glad that it is because honestly I forgot about this gem I rewatched episode 1 and like highlights on YouTube right after writing this script because a lot of it is actually comedy gold and it's hilarious watching people get pissed at each other because they're accidentally flexing on other people because they love other people even though they make-believe they don't that it doesn't make sense that they do hell yeah most confusing and unlikely to ever happen love triangle of all time but you know I'm definitely okay with it and waiting with open arms for that time that I am actually in a position like that because God knows I know I've never made a hentai video before but I might actually have to so with that said and done I hope you enjoyed this video I hope you like the biggest flexes in anime 16 I've had a lot of really great flexes that I want to talk about for such a long time like Isaiah and Olivia and even the second mizukage and now the fact it's awesome man I love making these videos I don't do them a ton anymore because they made that whole light goal thing so at this point yeah I want you to reach that light goal cuz I want to hit the quota so I can upload the biggest flexes in anime 17 within a week I want you to do this these are too fun to put together man I love having a good time recording a video you know just talking about like the greatest moments in anime that made you originally fall in love with it I hope you enjoyed feel free to subscribe for future epic videos hell yeah apik sorry if I didn't sound overly excited I still have a cold and my voice is absolute crap especially after recording for 30 minutes have yourselves the most wonderful evening once again link in the description to the free download RPG crossing void global thanks for the sponsor fam keep on flexing and remember to stay weird fam [Music]
