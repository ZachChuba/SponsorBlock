platform to build a beautiful online presence the internet culture wars are upon us my friends in one corner you have this is important culture your silence is deafening and in the other corner you have meme culture it's a great template ability this is important culture it's so important that I'm making it a thread a meme culture are you so proud of so first up this is important culture this is important culture wants you to know that this is indeed very important as their name implies they like to assign significance to just any number of things you've probably never heard of but this is important as is this this is important too I hope you have room in your brain for this one because if you're not concerned about this that you're part of the problem and this is important culture everything is important everything is serious everything is sad the world is a it's a dark very darkest place and there everything is broke I don't like stereotyping people but if you were going to stereotype them you would say that these people are easily offended oh so standing up for what's right suddenly makes me easily offended I have no regrets and then in the other corner on the complete opposite side of the spectrum we have meme culture meme culture flies in the face of this is important culture because to these people everything is a joke a giant meteor could come crashing to earth and kill like half of the population and you're already thinking if the famous memes aren't you when your mom asks why you're looking at means instead of doing homework I have no oh when you order a 5-2 loopers from Taco Bell day and spend the rest of the night in the bathroom look that's not to say that this is important people can't be funny too they try given that they try some time they say things like this no like literally the word this this and sometimes they say this three times this this this and sometimes they might even say this like this it's sort of like just a rotating list of cliches that are usually pointing to something that is this is important say it louder for da people in god Beth what by and large I would say that the award for better sense of humor goes to meme culture but I don't think that this is an important culture once to be that funny I mean do you watch late-night comics I think they think that that's funny am i right we have two very different very different visions of the future people who take themselves too seriously and people who don't take anything seriously at all who shall prevail the problem is it's sort of a Batman in the Joker situation we've got here where both sides need the other one to thrive and so that we have a good movie perfectly balanced as all things should be I mean where would meme culture be without this is important people doing literally anything and and where would this is important culture be without ignorant children to lecture about the things that are this is important you know when you turn me into a meme the other day that actually really hurt my feelings doesn't that bother you at all that you hurt me I have no look I don't want to live in a world where we can't take things seriously okay I mean some things are important not this is important but important at the same time though I I really don't want to live in a world where we can't laugh at things okay that would be sad and this channel would be dead well I can't even remember the last time I laughed at something Oh honestly the last time I laughed was the other day I well it wasn't technically a laugh it was more like you know I mean it a man fell in the dares he was kind of oh I actually just listen to a podcast about when people fall into the dirt it ruins the ecosystem of the earthworms I wish you had sent me that podcast the other day before I laughed because probably so who knows who knows who will come out on top I don't know okay I'm not gonna sit and pretend to know I hope no one does actually okay we might get tired of memes one day but but also if the this is important people win then I guess everyone wins in a way participation trophies and all that you know am i right I have no regrets but you know what who cares I mean soon enough none of this is going to matter anyways right now at this very second this is important adults or having children believe it or not that are rebelling through meme culture but one day the meme kids are going to become meme adults and they're going to have kids and those kids are probably gonna be the most emo kids of all time if you haven't bought stock at Hot Topic now while it's low you know what's wrong with you that's where I'm headed right now that's where I'm going website or domain that squarespace.com slash cow when you get tired of memes one day we might get tired of memes one day what life has been like since the office ended the world is a it's a dark very dark place and everything is broken when you haven't checked out Squarespace yet why don't you have a website when your dad tells a dad joke I think they think that that's funny when you think about your mortality I mean soon enough none of this is going to matter anyways [Music]
