so be a beautiful guy and welcome back as always I'm three kids stacked on top of each other in a trench coat and you're watching Disney Channel you guys have been following me for a while you probably noticed that I'm not always the most consistent with the type of content I make when I started I was doing pretty much exclusively like reaction and commentary stuff but as time has gone on I've done more like movie reviews a couple video essays I even recently did a very 2010 style sketch but today I want to get back to my roots a little bit and just do a good old-fashioned just nice simple reaction video the problem is I'm a little bit rusty luckily though there's a ton of reaction channels on YouTube that I could watch I kind of get some pointers take some notes and really learn the best way to be a reaction channel and I think I found a really good one his name is Vlad TV I'll make those are for my boots nobody knows the actual answer I found them because one of his videos was untended no it's good he's got 2.1 million subscribers so you know he's good so what we're gonna be doing today to help me get the hang of the whole reaction channel thing again is we're gonna be watching this guy's awesome videos and learning from the best taking notes taking names and learning how to be successful on YouTube that's why it's too sticky I don't like that whatever it is it's too stone wait never mind okay no when you go on your first date with a girl or a boy guys like if you've never been on a date with a girl or boys or strawberry have you gone the first date you always have to make a special guy's like really cool I don't know like something really sweet that you'll remember for the rest your life you're still talking about the date like she has to say like I'm gonna tie her with a pro five years ago when we went on a first date and you got me dad stick your ice cream that I hated I hated it but hey she remembers there's like pancakes vice versa so she you know if you take a guy on a date what are you saying just life of my life at like if nobody's telling you this stuff yeah okay I didn't come here for that actually be present I'm sorry I let my emotions get the best of me obviously blad knows what he's doing he's got two million subs I shouldn't doubt him so I'll remember that I'm gonna write that down if I have nothing to say about the video I'm reacting to just talk about something unrelated for four minutes all right so let's go ahead and watch another one of his videos and see we can get some more pointers what is all this he seems really confused all the time about everything I have no idea what these are I am so confused what's that thing called I don't even know I don't get what's happening we have to figure out what this is young he doesn't know what anything is even like simple things that everyone should know how did she do that where did she get the ceiling fan in her hand from ceiling fan you're gonna go with ceiling fan all right I don't get this that's a good idea though sometimes I'll talk about something and if I'm too knowledgeable on a subject it just comes off as pretentious and you don't want to be pretentious so it's probably better to just not know anything about anything and just constantly ask questions about everything got it let's go ahead and watch his most popular video this one has over 11 million views so this one should be like the prime example of the perfect reaction video it's called try not to DIY challenge now this shouldn't be too bad you broke the machine is that the whole video huh the whole video is him just watching this compilation of things get crushed and it's called try not to do it yourself challenge what's the challenge exactly I know it's tempting I know you're gonna want to whip out your industrial-sized crushing machine and crush various objects just like we are in this video but don't do it that's the challenge but again I shouldn't judge there's probably a method to his madness here because not only is that video called try not to DIY challenge almost every single one of his videos is called try not to DIY challenge hell this last 2 videos have the same title and thumbnail what should we watch next try not to DIY challenge or try not to DIY challenge her oh I see I think I'm gonna watch try not to DIY that's why I'm not growing as fast as I should be it's cuz I keep coming up with different titles for all my videos it's probably confusing you know you're subscribed to me and it's like wait what are those words those are different than the other video who is this guy probably losing subs left and right cuz I keep coming up with different video titles they should all be the same make sure you drink your water because this videos about again wet sometimes it seems like he wasn't ready for the video to start like it caught him off guard here we go you guys make sure your lips aren't dry because if they are then uh I don't people just don't like dry lips but yeah what's happening here was that another thing he does that I think is so funny is he'll be reacting to like the most insane acts of human athleticism and be so nonchalant about it who's a small circle for do we have people going through the small circle no but then you'll see like a cool iPhone and talk about it for two minutes that's so cool here we go again so much sauce imagine toothpaste was ready you guys to wash your teeth oh this gray cement is so cool hey that reminds me what if toothpaste was red would you still give your teeth a bath this guy's so funny the only thing I don't like about him is his thumbnails are so gross like I understand using clickbait I understand showing a crazy image that isn't in the video to try to get people to click on it but whatever happened to like a like a but it's like oh cool there's a but in this video I'm gonna watch it why could we just do that why is it gotta be like a like a fingernail coming off or like pus coming out of a face it's nasty so it doesn't feel like I'm just piling on to this poor guy I'm gonna talk about a couple other channels that do the same thing because obviously he's not the only want to do this here's another channel Tyrone Magnus reacting to the ultimate Mike drops of the Internet so this is gonna be pretty crazy I bet he's gonna have some insane things to say about this cuz these are some jaw-dropping moments he's heard this is gonna be awesome let's check it out people do also know on television Larry where you could do that you could just say nothing and that counts and last but not least oh I'm excited about this perhaps the my favorite person I've ever talked about on my channel he's also doing this [ __ ] that's right best freaking trend psy fortnight youtubers who swarm is doing try not to DIY challenges try not to DIY challenge I didn't even know that before I started making this video if that's not fate but I don't know what is what does seems to be pretty par for the course he like glad tbh is also very confused at everything what is this happen what is this man I don't know what's happening here what is going to happen so confused I mean it wouldn't be a trend if the person who's best at it wasn't also giving it a go wow that that's pretty crazy yeah alright you guys so right now into a five-second challenge right now ever has five seconds to go hit the like button and I know this might sound crazy I know I'm jumping the gun a little bit here but I'm excited okay I've been watching these awesome youtubers for like an hour now and I think I'm finally ready with everything I've learned today I think I'm finally ready to make the perfect reaction video let's give it a shot hello you know I can talk my prescriptions ready awesome yeah I've been so easy I'm gonna shoot I gotta go damn I forgot we were starting what's going on what's this guy doing see falling what's he doing oh that's so cool he's wearing a helmet that's awesome oh yes sports yeah you got it god is he gonna get it oh you met he missed it well why is this video in here he missed the shot it's so dumb oh they're giving a hugger that's so cute they're doing hungry what's for of your first three pockets Oh pull back yeah I didn't know how to skip that I'm sorry is he gonna get she got it you got it they're gonna hug I don't even know what this is right now I skateboard in front of a Walmart what's going on you know what on second thought maybe reaction videos aren't really my thing I'll probably just stick to what I know which is of course getting my balls tugged on one by one you're a little [ __ ] stinker thank you so much for clicking on this video I hope you enjoyed watching it as much as I enjoyed making it and to all my subscribers over the years thank you so much for all your continued support I know I kind of mix things up from time to time and if you subscribe for one thing and I start doing something else it can be kind of confusing or frustrating but I always feel like when I do veer off in other directions with my content that I get consistent support from you and that's like the best feeling in the world so again thank you so much I'm still gonna do commentary videos I know I haven't done it a lot lately it's cuz I haven't really had anything to comment on so I've been talking about movies and stuff
