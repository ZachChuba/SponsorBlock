hey everyone M tester and today I want to talk about mods now mods are gonna be a very powerful thing for your armor 2.0 gear and they're going to be imperative if you want to start pushing some of the harder and harder content I want to talk about how to get some of the best mods the enhanced mods I want to talk about the artifact mods I also want to talk about generalized mods I also want to talk about specialized mods that only work in some situations so let's get started one of the easiest ways to get some mods is from good old banshee here banshee has a material exchange that you can trade in and buy a couple of mods for mod components now I have all of these and I did not buy them from him which means these are in the general pool the general mod pool is something that is very accessible from a large amount of activities such as handing in vendor packages finding legendary prime and exotic items or engrams on the ground from doing things like the lunar spelunker kills doing random activities strikes crucible there are a lot of activities that will give you the base general mods if you're wondering what that is that is something like these mods here if you're looking at paragon mods discipline mods void resistance minor resistance all of these different mods if you look at you know grenade launcher reserves on grenade launcher aim all these different things all of these mods that apply to multiple different weapons there are hundreds of them in the game these mods you know are kind of the base level and then you can get into enhanced level perks if you look at something like this the enhanced unflinching scout rifle aim you cannot get this from every activity and from what I can tell the only activity you can get this from is from the nightfall now you can maybe get them from heroic nightmare hunts I haven't actually been able to find any yet and maybe that's just because of bad luck but what I have been getting is more specialized mods which I'll talk about in a minute but the best way to farm enhanced perks from what I can tell that our general tso Hamm can it like enhanced hand cannon loader or scout rifle loader if you're looking for enhanced hand can and targeting on your helmet or something like that the nightfall is gonna be one of your prime ways to do this now from what I can tell because I haven't gotten any to drop anywhere else is do the nightfall on one of the harder difficulties and maybe you get more mods from the very hard ones but I'm saying legend and above is gonna be your main way to get it if you end up getting one on hero let me know I'm not sure the same thing goes for these dream hunts where they called nightmare hunts if you can do these on hero and get enhanced perks not enhanced dreams bane or anything like that but just enhanced perks this might be a good way to do it too so I'm not gonna say you can't but I have done about 15 of them today and I have not gotten one maybe I'm unlucky I don't really know but apparently you can get them here I just haven't seen it so I'm going to bank on the nightfall now there are other mods in the game that are more specialized and that is this final slot so on any armored piece there well not on any armor piece but on a large amount of armor pieces there is an undying armor slot and these slots allow you to have very specialized stuff such as The Dream's Bane mod which boosts your damage against nightmares or the real a defender which boosts your damage while defending a relay in the raid or even the voltaic moat collector where you can get more heavy ammo when collecting motes in the raid these specialized ones come from the activity that you're doing if you're looking at killing nightmares you will get these types of mods from doing nightmare hunts if you're doing raid mods those come from the raid but they can also be enhanced versions I mean if you look at this one right here I've got the voltaic ammo collector and I've got the enhanced voltaic ammo collector both of these will come from the red from chests from activities but there's also some interesting nightmare mods that are available as well so if you look at this one this is the base dreamz bein mod you can also get something like the nightmare breaker mod which grants additional damage against enemies shields created by nightmare bosses there's also one on this arc piece here where are you that I got just now the nightmare banasur grants additional damage to your super against nightmare bosses so if you're looking for raid specific mods you get them from the raves if you're looking for nightmares specific mods you get them from the nightmare hunts the harder difficulty the better and the chance of getting enhanced perks now there's some other mods in the game that are very very very very very very very powerful let me go down here now if you look in my inventory there is the hive invigoration we've got some taken ones where's my taken one's taken armaments right taken invigoration these are very powerful mods to have and you can only slot these into Armour 1.0 gear or so we thought if you do some of the year 1 raids such as wait whoa what let me get back in the destinations here if you do some of the raids such as the what's it called where's the Leviathan crown of sorrow there we go credit card Sora you can actually get armor 2.0 versions of these if you do scourge of the past where's my scourge of the past that's on earth come on let's find it people if you do scourge of the past you can get fallen ones so you can actually get armor 2.0 versions of some of these extremely powerful mods so if you know you're doing Nightmare hunts against the Fallen you can use these awesome mods in your character now I haven't had the chance to farm these yet but I have seen some screenshots and they were looking good so make sure to go back and do some of the old raids because it's also a great activity to get high base roll stat gear if you're looking for the best base roll stats you know humanly possible you're gonna have to farm pinnacle activities and this is one of them now one of the other activities that I have heard is going to impact it is iron if you guys have played any iron banner I've got some iron banner tokens here iron banner is considered a pinnacle activity from what I've heard and so there is a chance that generalized mods such as enhanced reloaders enhanced flincher xin flats targeting they might be available from iron banner so if you have some tokens you might be able to trade them in and get them very quickly especially if you have a bunch of them if not playing the activity might be something you can do comp you know in the past was a pinnacle activity I don't know if it's still considered it I haven't seen any enhanced perks and I've played quite a bit of it but it can be a good way to get these perks now I'm kind of an idiot and I forgot to talk about the artifact so I'm actually throwing this into the middle of the video somewhere when I edited in the Gaylords I also provides mods for your character and some of them are enhanced as well and the nice thing is you don't have to worry too much about the element on these ones because they can slot in anywhere what I mean by this is something like enhanced hand cannon loader typically it has to go in a void armor piece but because it's on the artifact it's in the artifact you can use it on any piece of gear I could equip enhanced hand cannon loader on a Ark glove or a solar glove an exotic it doesn't even matter same thing goes with all of these mods so whatever you unlock on your artifact you can slot in on pretty much anything as long as it's on the proper item so what I mean by that is this is for arms loaders this entire slot is for arm loaders so if you want to slot these in you need them in an arm piece these ones aren't for chest armor if you want to slot these in you need a chest and these are class item mods you have to have it on a class item to slot them in now you can't unlock all of them but you can reset it for 10,000 glimmer now I have never reset it because I don't need to reset it I know I don't have a need right now I don't know if this scales up so if you don't have a lot of glimmer you might want to be careful that this doesn't stack up 9,000 times but yeah that's pretty much it if you want some good enhance perks I mean if you have the or the risk runner or something like that and have some machine gun loader beautiful perk to have you've got the hand cannon loader you've even got fusion rifle these perks are gonna be very powerful they only go in a couple particular slots so for the most part your helmet and your boots you need a lot of good generalized mods but for gloves for chest piece and for your class item you're probably gonna want to slot in some of these ones especially something like overload grenades or the oppressive darkness grenade they're very very very powerful mods to have and so unlocking these is going to be very important so make sure you're doing your bounties and playing and getting as much experience as possible so generalized perks play pretty much anything find legendaries open chests just play the game and you will get a multitude of them you'll get almost all of them rather quickly specialized perks those are from doing activities such as the raids and the nightmare hunts if you're looking for stuff specialized for nightmares do nightmare stuff if you're looking for stuff specialized to raids do those raids if you're looking for stuff you know like the fall and the take and stuff you have to do raids associated to that so last wish I believe gives you taken stuff the crown of sorrow gives you high of stuff and then scourge the past gives you fallen now enhanced perks are gonna come from the endgame pinnacle activities but I haven't seen them coming from raids if you're looking at something like enhanced hand cannon loader no one on my team has said that they've gotten it from doing the new raid at all they've gotten enhanced perks or enhanced versions of the specialized perks but not of the generalized ones and from what I can tell the main way to get those and the only way maybe is from the ordeal so that's pretty much it that's the rundown that's the quick and dirty if you guys are looking for mods that's how you get them thank you so much for watching and if I missed anything please let me know in the comments section below I will pin the comment I will share the comment I like to comment
