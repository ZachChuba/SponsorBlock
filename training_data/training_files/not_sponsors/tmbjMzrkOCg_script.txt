this video is brought to you by - Lane well hello friends we're doing another video on a country that has who veered into some real yikes territory over the years so yes I have amazing patrons who have helped me achieve many financial goals to get to the point where now I am a fully independent youtuber and one of those stretch goals was to make a four part series in my brief history series where I kind of profiled country on the BRICS countries which stand for Brazil Russia India China and South Africa and when I originally made it I thought it was just Brazil Russia India and China because you know I decided to write it down before looking things up because I'm smart in that way so when someone quickly reminded me that BRICS includes South Africa I knew that this was going to be a fun video project to work on South Africa is kind of a tough country with the whole history of apartheid white supremacy and settler colonialism which is pretty similar to my country of Canada with white supremacy and settler colonialism just you know we somehow have better branding know what I should really say is that South Africa at a certain point ins history made white supremacy and settler colonialism like an art form and we'll get into that so the bricks in general are an actual organization they're made up of five of the world's quote emerging economies they are expected to become the superpowers of the 22nd century and beyond now I've already done a video on the history of Brazil which is you definitely watch but honestly when it comes to look at the list you got Brazil okay you've got Russia okay India yeah China yeah and then South Africa kind of sticks out it doesn't really feel like it's emerging economy that's setting itself up to become one of the you know world's superpowers if anything if there's a country in Africa if they really wanted to have African representation you'd probably want to choose Nigeria it's got a population explosion on the horizon it has oil reserves and is quickly growing into one of them most powerful countries in the entire continent but South Africa does have a lot going for it it sits on a giant natural resource supply specifically in gold and diamonds and platinum which you can probably imagine makes South Africa a pretty good place for foreign investment where if you're thinking about everything in terms of global capitalism makes South Africa a juicy place to invest in South Africa's seen as this place where you can invest in the entire continent because South Africa has the best infrastructure or something like that I don't know I don't get to choose who's the member of the BRICS okay I was going to do it last in the series as I kind of cover them through the fall so expect that to the fall but then project Africa came to my attention which is that myself and 25 other history youtubers are producing content all coming out today if you're watching this in the day it came out and we're all talking about subjects to do with the African continent so it fit perfectly for me and there's a lot of reasons why South Africa is interesting to talk about it's one of the oldest regions humans have lived in and even things before humans but on top of that I am Canadian and I live in a settler colony Canada recently had a Truth Reconciliation Commission that was based on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission so there's a lot of eerie parallels between this country and my own so I would like to investigate the feeling of settler colonialism and also as a settler colonists myself as a white person on indigenous territory I have a lot of complex feelings so without further ado let's talk about South Africa so South Africa has had anatomically modern humans living there for over a hundred thousand years if you want to count non-human hominids like australopithecines and things like that there have been people living in South Africa for millions of years at one point it was considered one of the highest populated areas of the world when humans only lived in a few regions so this means we have evidence of cultures movements politics things happening that are older than the first human going to Europe this is like one of the cool things for me about studying South Africa a lot of Africa in general which is that the history is so deep like we talk about India and China as having 5,000 year histories and South Africa has a 130,000 year history which is an amount of time humans are incapable of understanding it also speaks to one of those things that always comes up when I'm having a more pensive moment about how humanity and what we know about what we call history is really just the tiniest sliver at the end of human culture just thinking about how much of human existence we know very little about and also just appreciating its old so an ethnic group that live in South Africa known as the sandpeople which is sort of a derogatory term that was given to them for being hunter-gatherers they're likely the descendants of the first anatomically modern humans to arrive in South Africa because they're also related to the Khoikhoi people oftentimes the generic name for the people and this ancient time period are known as the Kois on people just want to mention when we're talking about a hundred and thirty thousand years ago the first human migration to Eurasia so Europe or Asia was about 70,000 years ago so there were humans living in South Africa for 60,000 years and that was before the first migrations into Europe and Asia so how do we even know this is true like how do our colleges figure this out and I was really interested so it comes down to two factors which is one genetics there's a large amount of studies of the genetics of African people they have more genetic diversity than any other group which is a sign that they have been living in this region for a lot longer than other groups humans in general actually have remarkably low genetic diversity we're actually the average human is much more similar to the other average human than say two cats or two dogs or two of most other species which there's there's there's theories about that including the Toba catastrophe theory but that's a different video and most of the genetic diversity of humanity the little that there is is almost entirely contained within the african continent which is one of the big signs that this is where we evolved this is where we originated and you know coding back the genetic lineage we do find that the first ancestors of the indigenous people of South Africa probably did arrive in South Africa are around 130,000 years ago another thing they'd like to look at and this comes up in the study of indigenous Americans too which is linguistic diversity or the traits different like sounds and different grammar rules and things like that move and have a lineage of their own so you can almost trace a family tree of language and also you can tell that people have been in a region for a long time when there is a lot of diversity of language this is why in Canada or in North America in general the most diverse and complex language groups tend to live in British Columbia because that's about where humans first came to the continent via the Bering Land Bridge so that's really cool I think that these are really interesting ways to trace the lineage of people and find movements that just kind of Bly archaeology cuz it's just so old that there's such scant remains like physical remains of the people who lived in this time that every time it's found it's like a huge historical event there's only a few caves where we have found evidence of people living in South Africa that is dated back this far and each one of them has been labeled as a world edge sight which means like you know it's a big deal and has mention a little bit earlier the ancestors the Khoisan people they lived in South Africa and when they were a long time ago that this was probably one of the most populous regions for Humanity in general to the point where like this was a major evolution Centre for humans learning how to do human things in some of those amazing discoveries we found paintings we found so much artwork that is so old we can scarcely conceive of it just an absolute treasure for the species now the people who lived in this region were primarily hunter-gatherers you know foraging off of the land and occasionally killing wild game to feed themselves at about 2,000 years ago the Khoikhoi people entered the region and with them they brought some new technologies I guess for lack of a better word on how to get food specifically hurting which is a huge deal in South Africa because South Africa has a lot of planes and so there was a big influx of you know hurting large herds of animals to eat to get milk to get skins get fur you know all those things you need it had huge social ramifications the introduction of herding basically changed a lot of how culture works and how people got their calories all sort of things it became the predominant way of producing food and because historical materialism is a thing the introduction of this pastoral lifestyle as opposed to foraging started the development of more hierarchical societies this is when you started to have societies gathered around clans which were run by you know chieftains and things like that it's also the beginning of the concept of private property and the concept of wealth as a thing then in the 6th century the bond to people started to launch this mass migration across the continent it touched virtually the entire continent but when it came to South Africa it was extremely profound they came in through the Congo Basin and you know when they came in they displaced people and stuff moved around but they also introduced a bunch of new technologies again they brought agriculture they were growing sorghum and millet there they also with them ironworking and so some of the most interesting and cool weapons in the world are developed by bond to people in South Africa it's really really awesome and the bond to people also brought with them the first Kingdom which was called the kingdom of Maupin goon way I apologize in advance that was probably a horrible pronunciation but this kingdom was the forerunner for the kingdom of a Zimbabwe which will be a dead countries don't you worry and then as what happens with any cool story Europeans arrived and everything goes to [ __ ] so the first Europeans to discover what would be today's South Africa was a Portuguese sailor by the name of Bartolomeu Dias who arrived in the country in 1488 is that right 1488 that's an unfortunate number he was looking for an alternate route to get to India to reconnect with the spice trade and various luxury good trades there because the Ottoman Empire was on the grow and the Ottoman Empire had basically taken control of what would be called the Silk Road which is a pathway through Asia so you know they were looking away to sail all the way down on Africa and come back up they did not really appreciate how big it was but they eventually did it I also made a video about the whole Ottoman Empire thing so you can watch that it's really old though and a little bit later in 1497 Vasco da Gama crossed the Cape of Good Hope and as the person who actually found the full route up to India and made the trade link which was a really big deal for South Africa because before the 20th century going down around the continent applies really the fastest way to sail to India and South Africa is an important port of call during that process and so trades aren't open up and the Dutch became the first people to make a permanent European settlement in South Africa specifically the mega-corporation known as the Dutch East India Company which wanted to make a permanent place in the region so that they could resupply their ships with you know fruits and vegetables and all the things you need to you know feed sailors then they could you know load up and go up to India very small very strategic just you know little thing they built their first settlement and they started to build farms but the indigenous people there the Khoikhoi people who were living in the region where they settled did not want to have anything to do with them so they started to import farmers from Europe to start you know growing crops they could have those vegetables to give to those ships as they were moving along and also they imported slaves from places like Indonesia India Madagascar Moore ETS places that the Dutch had some sort of holding in and eventually also quite high and sand people were drafted as indentured servants which is not technically slavery but freedom clothes so with all of these different cultures and backgrounds and stuff living in this place you had you know various languages meshing together some of the people who they brought in were from Germany and France so yeah Dutch German French and also Khoikhoi and sand people and you know all the imported slaves that I mentioned and they started to mesh together into a language that was sort of a mix of all of these different linguistic backgrounds and what developed in this period was the beginnings of what would eventually become the language Afrikaans which is a language that is pretty unique to South Africa and the colony was a pretty successful and they started to expand northwards into more and more of indigenous territory which led to conflicts with not only the Khoikhoi in the same people but also new groups such as the people and that competition created fighting specifically a really common you know raiding tactic that would show up a lot in South Africa which is cattle raiding all the Dutch stuff started in the 1650s but the expansion north and the friction started in the late 1700s it would continue on until about a thing I think they're still working on that so during the Napoleonic era South Africa as part of the Netherlands which had you know which had been conquered by France at a certain point became sort of aligned with Napoleon so in order to prevent South Africa from falling into French hands the British invaded in 1795 then after the French were defeated in the polling Ankara was over the Brits decided to take it as a spoil of war so in the treaty they decided that you know we're just gonna keep South Africa sorry they renamed it to the Cape Colony and they had actually not that much interest in it beyond just being a strategic port again on the route to India which Britain was starting to get pretty interested in and once you get to the mid 1800s things start to really ramp up and get much more contentious so in the early 19th century the English brought two major reforms to Cape Colony that the Dutch people living there didn't much appreciate specifically forcing them to speak English and second banning slavery which haha Dutch living there otherwise known as the Boers really did not appreciate so borse which I'm it is the word for the Afrikaans speaking sort of more Dutch white South African errs which is going to be important in the future don't worry I started to leave the Cape Colony and move more into the interior of what would be called you know northern South Africa northern South Africa this started to escalate and then in the 1830s there was a big Trek of a lot of Boers moving into the region like 30 to 50 wild boars they were mad that they couldn't practice slavery what can I say but yikes so they expanded into the region and made three independent states known as the South African Republic the Orange Free State and Natalya and of course they were not expanding into empty territory despite what the far-right myths about this time will tell you they were expanding into indigenous territory that was owned by herders and you know those people who had been living there for a hundred and thirty thousand years the Brits do not like this idea of there being independent African kingdoms but also independent Dutch states so Brits came for them just put a pin that for now I want to talk about some cool [ __ ] going on the meantime one part of the goony tribe known as the Zulu started to really take off in the early 19th century with Shaka Zulu the leader leading this huge campaign to conquer tons and tons of territory founding a kingdom to take over all of the Chieftains Chaka Zulu was so successful because he modernized the military structure and had his own people in charge instead of local chieftains and well Chaka Zulu today is considered this like legendary Zulu warrior of South African history and probably is going to be his own video someday because his story is quite epic and one that we need to learn more about the displacement of people caused by this campaign of expansion from the Zulus led to the formation of what would become the modern nation-states of Lesotho and East Latini so in the late 19th century the Cape Colony was getting little bits of Independence a little bit more autonomy but for the most part it was still very much in the British Empire and within Cape Colony they started to develop you know electoral systems including suffrage not based on race ha would have been great if that stayed of course that was not the case in the Boer Republic's I will get there also because of a labor shortage especially in the region of natal lots and lots of Indian workers were brought to South Africa to work this led to natal this region of South Africa becoming one of the largest communities of Indian people outside of India including Mahatma Gandhi who lived a good chunk of his life in South Africa and was a civil rights leader there another interesting thing was there was another one of these big treks out to find a place to settle by the Grieco people which is this sort of movement brought about by a bunch of mixed-race people they eventually settled and then the British started to sort of encroach on them so they decided to move than the British encroach on them and eventually they were conquered but I just like cool little story that there was this Trek of mixed-race people united by their mixed race identity and going and settling places what I'm learning is that in South Africa mixed races an identity in and of itself and has a lot of unique things to it and so their story is quite interesting and I'm doing a brief history not an incredibly detailed history so they get in skimmed over but please if you find any of this interesting please look it up yourself or if you think something is really worth a video just yell at me in the comments it's fine it's fine fine everyone doesn't the British also did a very settler colonial thing started making these extremely unfair deals with indigenous people the indigenous black population thinking that oh so you're asking to use part of our territory for a period of time and you know still under us in exchange for these things and you know the Europeans thinking no no you you just gave us this land for you know these Pitons that we gave you it's very reminiscent of how people treated indigenous people here in the Americas so not only were the British doing this but the Boers were pretty much always in a low-grade state of conflict on their frontiers against indigenous people who you know wanted to continue living on the land that is there during this period the British annexed the Zulu Kingdom in a series of extremely bloody Wars the British also annexed the passat Oh people and the Boer states were conquering territory owned by the belly and the belly people and Ben diamonds in late 1860's diamonds were discovered in South Africa just so happens it was right underneath where those Greek people were living so the British conquered the Greek was to basically take their land to build diamond mines by the late 19th century South Africa was producing ninety five percent of the world's diamonds this vast amount of wealth tripled the amount of money that South Africa was making off of exports and it gave them the economic boost that they needed to like Canada and Australia start towards the path of becoming a Dominion which is sort of a part way toward becoming independent it's like independence asterisk because you still don't have control over your own foreign policy or military but you get to do everything else yourself and of course the diamond mines succeeded because of the ruthless exploitation of black labor that was not paid very well at all interesting when you're an indigenous people of place and you find out that it's obscenely wealthy with some of the rarest materials and most in-demand materials on earth and then you know you don't get to experience any of the wealth that comes from that good thing those days are over it's not those days aren't over so not long after diamonds were discovered in the Transvaal region gold was discovered and this was even more brutal and even more dangerous work because gold in South Africa required these extremely deep mines and in the 19th century you could imagine not not super super safe it was so unsafe that the African laborers living in the region refused to work in those mines they were just too dangerous and so the mine owners had to rely on imported labor from China South Africa what a fun story all of this mineral wealth and you know long-term expansion plans led to a series of Wars for the British to take out these independent or Republic's these are collectively called the Boer Wars they happen in the late 19th and early 20th century and the first war the British got their asses handed to them but the second war they imported so many troops from across the Empire that they outnumbered the Boers by a ridiculous margin and the Boers were defeated I know about this because in Canada we talk about how Canadian troops were sent in the second Boer War and yeah we help the British conquer these Boer Republic's and when I used to live in London Ontario there's a lot of references to Canadian involvement with the Boer Wars a completely unnecessary war two naked Lee steal resources from people who are then naked leaf stealing resources from indigenous peoples there's like two layers of colonization going on here hi Canada we can only sell ourselves as having this wonderful history and we are just we are just collaborators and the worst things all the time I should also mention that the Boer Wars were the first use by the British of several wonderful tactics that would become very endemic of twentieth-century combat specifically the scorched earth policy which is when you are retreating from a region you destroy anything that might be of use to your enemies so that they can't get anything and they start suffering attrition when they start entering that territory and concentration camps which you know another thing we're still doing today so once the four wars were over and all the Boer Republic's were unified under British rule the British smashed them all together with Cape Colony and made the Union of South Africa in 1909 it was made into a legit independent Dominion because of that South Africa was involved in the first world war fighting Germany in East Africa by the way one of the history youtubers who is participating in this project Africa series is doing a video on world war one in East Africa you should go and watch that next but yeah there were South African troops in East Africa West Africa the Middle East and even in Europe in the trenches with everyone else the South Africans also participated in World War two one thing to note is that amongst the Afrikaners who are you know now the new word for the people who are of Afrikaans speaking because there's no more Boer Republic's there was a surprisingly high amount of Afrikaner participation in pro-nazi groups which after the war were folded into the Afrikaner focused National Party and we'll get to the National Party in just a minute the first leader of South Africa was Louis Botha who was part of the South African Party but from the get-go there were tensions between the English and the Afrikaners the black population of South Africa were also you know angry and wanted to increase our lot in life and did not like being colonized by white people so a group of black resistance movements got together to form the South African native National Conference which will become a big player in the resistance against black oppression in South Africa just you wait and it was actually quite a unique group too because they were made up of a mix of traditional and pretty modern groups there were you know Western educated people in this movement as well as you know just indigenous Chiefs in night 20 for that national party that I mentioned I was run by the Afrikaners came to power and what this resulted in is Afrikaans which was considered sort of a low language by the working class you know like a mixed language it replaced Dutch as one of the two official languages of South Africa and so the Union of South Africa continued until about 1960 when a referendum was passed that made South Africa leave the British Commonwealth and become an independent republic everyoneís wanna now we're gonna go talk about apartheid so when South Africa got its independence some of the first things that it did was to clamp down on the human and civil rights of the people of color living in their country black people were not allowed to vote and as a majority of the population of the country about 70% of the country were forced into these harsh segregated zones that made up about 8% - the country's landmass so just imagine seventy percent of the country forced evicted from their homes and forced to live in 8% of the country these militarized slums really a small percentage a tiny minority of white people owned ninety percent of the land in South Africa in 1948 the National Party put more codified and harsh set of laws in place that were very similar to these and gave it the official name of apartheid which is the Afrikaans word for apartness and it wasn't too long until the world really was against it in 1966 the United Nations officially embargoed South Africa calling apartheid a crime against humanity when they refused to end apartheid in 1974 South Africa was kicked out of the United Nations and wouldn't rejoin until 1994 but while diplomatically isolated who could possibly be an ally of a country which takes its indigenous population and forces them into these open-air militarized prisons in order to maintain white supremacy I mean of course South Africa's close ally was Israel these two white supremacist states primarily traded weapons to fund this massive police military force that South Africa required in order to keep its indigenous people under control and the United States got in the game by shipping weapons to South Africa via Israel there's even a pretty substantiate a rumor that Israel tested its open secret nuclear weapons program in South Africa on an island off the coast then in South Africa things got even worse in 1970 with the homelands act where they took a lot more people in victim from their homes and put them in these reserves called bantu stands in the 1980s and this came out through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission there were these death squads and police detachments that did state sanctioned assassination of dissidents against a state for people fighting for black rights and opposing apartheid they would kill people and then they would falsely call it black on black crime is not fun and this one on for years to maintain white supremacy South Africa had to expend a lot of resources to the point where they were spending over a quarter of their annual budget on the military so like what do you do what do black people do in such horribly oppressive conditions well I will tell you they didn't take it lying down do you remember the South African native National Congress well in the 40s and 50s the student part of that movement started to formulate into the African National Congress they were inspired by Gandhi and the movement to liberate India and wanted to do the same in South Africa they did a campaign of defiance against the state which was mostly things like boycotts strikes civil disobedience you know nonviolent tactics to try and change things over in 1955 the ANC became allies with a bunch of other groups representing people of mixed race of India and background of various different grounds and they made a sort of coalition of organizations in order to fight apartheid in that meeting they made a document that called for racial equality in South Africa and dedicated themselves to the cause of fighting it with every tooth and nail they could the ANC also tried to talk to universities and get them to do an academic boycott of South Africa but then when the ANC tried to resist non-violently a law that would require black South Africans to use identification cards when going into white areas the government murdered tons of these activists and something called the Sharpeville massacre after that the ANC decided that non-violence was no longer on the table they started a military wing and started to resist the South African government using like sabotage and targeted attacks on the colonial infrastructure and it was led by Nelson Mandela in 1962 Nelson Mandela was arrested by the South African government tried as a terrorist and sentenced to life in prison the military campaigns of the ANC continued throughout the 70s and 80s under different leadership they got backing from the Soviet Union to oppose apartheid which then led to the United States and many Western powers supporting apartheid in order to oppose communism Thank You Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan for that one and South Africa started to raid and bomb ANC bases in neighboring countries things didn't get better until the USSR collapsed and a lot of public support for the ANC in the West started to pick up and South Africa basically buckled under pressure in 1990 the ANC was no longer a banned group and peace talks began beginning with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison the early 90s were a very optimistic time for South Africa in 1991 apartheid ended in 1993 South Africa got a new constitution which guaranteed equal rights for everyone to vote in 1994 South Africa had its first multiracial election where the ANC was elected by a huge majority and Nelson Mandela became the first democratically elected president of South Africa and you know a lot of tellings of the head tria south africa would you know say well that's good and then kind of ride off into the sunset from there but that would be telling an overly happy story since the end of apartheid about 800,000 white skilled workers left the country representing about a quarter of the white population of South Africa the government ended up having a lot of financial issues from foreign development loans and also a massive program to combat HIV in South Africa where it was a huge huge issue those gold mines still abuse migrant labor and South Africa today is one of the most unequal countries on earth the ANC which had a lot of socialist principles behind its founding in the 90s turned towards neoliberal economics including regressive tax cuts and things like that and various geopolitical events happening in their neighboring countries have created a lot of refugees and migrants whom South Africans have been extremely xenophobic against leading to some brutal mistreatment there was one study I found that said that South African xenophobia is some of the strongest on the planet and of course I'm sure you've heard from white nationalists great replacement white genocide you know internet trash goblins like those people have been promoting a conspiracy theory that the blacks are killing all of the whites and that there's a white genocide happening in South Africa it's completely unfounded totally untrue and I'm not gonna get into it because there's a lot to get into but I'm gonna link to two videos by rational disconnect and Jose that talk about it pretty well as a white settler and a settler colonial state the story of South Africa certainly rhymes a lot with my country story with America's story with Israel story with Australia's story and so on South Africa has had a very harsh history and despite that a few moments of victory justice the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to come to terms with just how bad apart I was was one of the greatest moments of healing between settlers and the colonized and Canada when we did a similar thing based it off of the South African example it's actually why we know so many dark details about apartheid after the end of it what else can I say except they've been through a lot and I hope they get the good times that they deserve hey everyone before you go this video was part of a massive collaboration called Project Africa with 26 history creators making videos on the continent you can definitely go and find the playlist if you want to
