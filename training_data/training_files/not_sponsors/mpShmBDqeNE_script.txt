this video was made in partnership with [Music] curiositystream [Music] there are several factors you can look at to determine where a build belongs on the tier list do they have any uniquely overpowered abilities are they responsible for major declines in the player bases of other factions do they have good matchups against other top tiers these are all important but another good indicator is how long a build's core strategies and stats have stood the test of time if a build has managed to succeed across multiple balance patches and new game expansions that's a great indication that it dominates a highly stable niche in the meta for example dragonflies have been one of the top builds patrolling the airspace above swamps and lakes since the carboniferous expansion by the same token sharks have been the dominant marine force since before the terrestrial servers were even added to the game and while not quite as old as either of these factions crocodilians have also had a dominant hold on the same niche since even before the dinosaurs having survived several of the harshest updates the game has ever seen despite this i don't think any players are all that surprised at the crocodilian's extensive domination record i mean this is a build which combines downright busted stats with arguably the most effective strategy in the game resource camping so today i'm going to break down all the important features of the crocodilian build and the strategies that they use to win games every build has its strengths and weaknesses so my goal with this video is that it'll be useful as a guide for croc players trying to optimize their game play but also for other players that need help countering the crocodilian's infamous strategies this video is meant to apply to both crocodiles and alligators because even though there are a few subtle differences between the builds overall their game plan is very similar alright so first the crocs biggest strengths first and foremost is their bite attack the crox bite is the strongest in the game able to one shot most low to mid hp targets and deal serious damage even to the bulkiest players one important thing to note is that this bite deals crush type damage making it one of the few attacks in the game powerful enough to overwhelm most defenses even the high level armor seen in builds like the turtle and armadillo aren't enough to stop it but as powerful and damaging as the crocs bite is crocodilian players actually aren't optimized for direct damage in fact most tank builds can recover from a single bite without much consequence the crocodilian strategy revolves around being able to bring down large targets usually ones that have high enough base hp to survive several powerful attacks that's why despite having the strongest bite force in the game in terms of pure dps a crocs bite is surpassed by sharks due to their serrated blade-like teeth while a croc definitely could spec into this type of tooth for the relevant match-ups the crocodile's curved conical teeth are more useful these teeth make the crocodiles grapple much more difficult to break out of and this is where the crocodile's ability to take down tank builds really shines through as their infamous grapple combo the death roll is one of the most powerful attacks in the game and can tear through the hp of even the bulkiest players let's continue with the crocs other strong points the most important ones are going to be the two abilities they use to maximize their effectiveness in the water for both stealth and mobility first their rudder-like tail grants them a massive speed boost while swimming this is what shifts many a match up in their favor when in combat in the water as most of the crocs potential targets easily outmaneuver it on land and second their nostrils and eyes being situated on top of their heads grants them a unique ability to remain almost completely hidden underwater while still remaining vigilant of their above water surroundings and allows them to keep their stamina topped up by not forcing them to hold their breath alright now let's get into the crocs weaknesses and then discuss optimal strategies and counter play the crocs biggest weakness is its reliance on water this isn't that big a weakness as just about every player needs to visit a watering hole at some point if your party migrates you'll most likely need to cross a river at some point in order to find more food but even if you play as a non-migratory build you'll likely still need to top up your thirst meter every so often to avoid serious stat debuffs still it is a potential vulnerability if the water in your preferred server begins to dry up an occurrence that has become more and more frequent in the anthropocene meta this can greatly increase the difficulty of your gameplay by removing your stealth and mobility bonuses crocodiles don't respawn in the water and instead must build and protect their nests on shore objective defense is always a tough portion of any player's quest line but doing so in a vulnerable state is even more difficult another big weakness is the reliance on the death roll combo to score kills even though it's a guaranteed kill if the full combo finishes executing the entire move requires uninterrupted focus on a single target for a significant period of time as with most grappler builds this leaves the user quite vulnerable to attacks from your target's party members so how can crocodile players best mitigate this weakness and how can other players best exploit it so for crocodile players the number one thing you need to prioritize during an attack is dragging your target into deeper water this accomplishes three things one it separates the target from their party two it puts them into a position where their mobility is reduced because of the negative terrain modifier from water and three it inflicts the drowning status effect quickly draining the target's stamina and reducing the number of opportunities they have to counter-attack of course this isn't without risk dragging a target requires a lot of stamina and if your thermal runs out while your target isn't struggling to get free they may escape or worse counter-attack you can mitigate this by attacking alongside other crocodilian mains as they can help you drag away your target quicker and reduce their chances of escape even further of course this means you'll be splitting the loot but it's worth it for bigger kills for you non-croc mains watching obviously the absolute best strategy is simply to be large and or strong enough to resist being pulled into the water if you're the one doing the pulling the kroc player isn't going to continue their attack for long but if that's not an option there are still a few tactics you can try to make your odds more favorable the first is avoiding deep water if you need to cross a river or find a spot to drink you'll be safest if the croc would need to drag you a great distance to get you somewhere you couldn't stand plus it's a lot more difficult for a croc to hide in shallow water so you'll be less vulnerable to surprise attacks if you're a player with the ability to fly or to climb you might assume this advice doesn't apply to you since you can stay out of reach of a croc attack however one thing to keep in mind is that the crocs rudder tail ability has the secondary effect of granting it a greatly increased attack range while in deep water as it can launch itself a considerable distance to strike targets above the surface this is a relatively slow and highly committal option though so my advice to flying players is that if you need to approach the surface of the water keep moving as striking a moving target would require a pretty insane read on the part of the croc player it's not impossible though so don't get greedy next i recommend staying with a tight tight-knit party that's willing to fight alongside you as mentioned before the crocs death roll combo is vulnerable to being interrupted so if your teammate is being attacked you may be able to save them even if your attacks don't do all that much damage of course there may be other crocs around so you're taking a risk in doing so but still crocs really can't do much other than flee to deep water if they're being attacked in multiple directions so coordinated attacks are paramount this advice also translates for any player trying to loot crocodile nests this is by no means easy but since the crocs nest will be on land the lack of their mobility bonus will make the croc less capable of catching you the best strategy is to continuously bait out attacks luring the croc out into the heat eventually this will daze the crocodile allowing you to loot their nest uncontested if you're a croc don't worry though there are ways to better protect your nest making sure there is a patch of shade close to the nest is important to avoid being dazed from the heat exhaustion status effect another surprisingly powerful and underutilized strategy is to ally with bird players who also nest in the sand they can protect your eggs from being looted by the more nimble players while you can protect their buried eggs from being stomped on by the larger players [Music] now one piece of advice i see tossed around is the idea to spec into abilities that would make a crocodile less reliant on water things like longer legs replacing claws with hooves and so on these ideas have actually been tried in the past and have never really caught on i get a lot of tags on twitter asking to mention how overpowered terrestrial crocodile builds were however i think history shows the opposite the two main times terrestrial croc builds have surfaced have been during the most chaotic underdeveloped metas first during the triassic aka the expansion that followed the most heavy-handed series of nerfs and bands the game had ever seen and the paleogene the expansion that followed the mass ban that removed dinosaurs and pterosaurs from the game both of these instances were at a time where the previous top-tier predator build had been banned and every faction was taking a shot at trying to control that niche in the triassic builds like post asukas were great at terrorizing the synapsid player base the top tier synapsid listersaurus was dominating the meta so having a good matchup against them meant a free top-tier spot however these terrestrial proto-crocodilians quickly lost their top tier status as the more mobile dinosaurs started competing and in the paleogene almost the exact same thing happened galloping crocodilians dominated the early meta but once the mammal player base started competing for the top tier predator spot once again the kroc player base couldn't keep up and was forced back into the traditional aquatic ambush role so yeah sorry cheetah gator fans you can try again after the next major balance patch but for now there's no shame in sticking to the tried and true game plan crocs have perfected over the past several balance patches they're undoubtedly a top tier predator and i can't see their placement on the tier list changing anytime soon hopefully this video did a good enough job covering the crocodilians optimal strategy and counterplay much of the footage featured in this video is from a documentary called caring killers a film which explores the nile crocodile builds hunting prowess but also focuses on showing off the dedication and intelligence demanded from crocodile mains as they guard their respawn points and help new croc players get started it's an impressively interesting documentary and goes into a lot more depth than i'm able to do in a single youtube video if
