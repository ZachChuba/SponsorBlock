Squarespace [Music] my grandfather's name is Dennis field and he's about to turn 92 and I like to try and get down and visit my grandparents fairly regularly but often finding those gaps in work is really tricky and I sometimes only get down a couple of times a year but from the minute I arrived he starts to tell stories stories of his time travelling the world as an export manager stories of his time on the stage as a semi-pro opera singer and most recently he pulled out two photo albums talking me through his time spent with the Royal Navy as a 17 year old from 1945 to 1947 the close of the Second World War when he arrived in Hong Kong in late 1945 he bartered a packet of player cigarettes for a box brownie camera because he wanted to document the trip that he was on and this incredible experience that he was a part of and so he started to take photographs from Gibraltar Amata in the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal Singapore up to the very north of China Japan down from Malaysia into Australia and as he told me these stories and flicked through these beautiful images I found the whole experience really evocative sitting and listening to those stories and being able to see the photographs that he'd taken reminded me of what a powerful medium photography is in storytelling when you combine first-hand accounts told with images of the time and space time and places that you and I will never be able to visit it's a really complete experience when I went down to visit my grandparents just before Christmas I set up a couple of cameras and asked him to talk through some of these stories and show some of these images so I'm gonna do a favor in this video and not talk very much in hand straight over to him if you're a fan of history like me I think you'll find the stories on their own fascinating I mean we all know about those years in World War 2 but what happened in those two or three years afterwards when the world was trying to rebuild itself but even if you're not interested in history I think looking at him talk through his images will get you thinking about your own photography differently not just taking images for today but how will people in 30 40 or 50 years view your images so I'm gonna keep quiet now and hand over to my grandfather Dennis field [Music] as well I was 13 years old when the war broke out so by 1944 I was old enough to volunteer I didn't volunteer to serve my country believe me I volunteered to get the hell out of a war factory I've been working in I should point out that I much preferred the uniform of the German Navy but by 1944 it looked as though they were losing so I thought being a very intelligent young man I decided to join our side at that time radar was in its infancy and I remember when we went to our first lectures I went into a small theater there were guards on the door and the first thing you saw on the screen was a message that stated everything that you see and learn from this lecture he's a closely guarded secret disclosed it for no one so at 17 for the first time in my life I feel quite important I had the non-substantive rating as they called it a petty officer I was an RC one which meant that I control a crew of 14 those responsible for navigation and those responsible for gunnery another good reason for taking radar if you took an ordinary seamanship course it took a month therefore my my course took nine months in total so that kept you out of the fighting very intelligent by August 1945 we had the Japanese and the war was with the Japanese was ended and we set sail as the ship HMS big boo babe a class frigate they were specially designed to ward off kamikaze bombers wonderful experience who has imagined 17-year old never been out of the country first up Gibraltar we went from Malta to Alexandria and then down the Suez Canal we're in Colombo in November insulin or sure rancor as it is now and from there Singapore December Singapore does not look like that now I promise you then we went on to Hong Kong rived in Hong Kong for Christmas and I thought about perhaps is the first time I thought seriously about photography so money of course is always the problem I think we were paying to have a pound a month but cigarettes were of a barter value so I went into Hong Kong and with a tin of 50 player cigarettes which cost me one in six months that's about seven and a half P I was thumbing to buy or barter my first camera a brownie so from that point onwards I was primarily shooting photographs of the ship's crew and an immediate surroundings pincher Martin agree a raid raid our great friend of mine Noah bot wood bot see he was another radar operator most of these guys were were radar but all these were taken with that wonderful little brownie box camera [Music] this handsome guy is me believe it or not I have a photograph in one of my albums which I saw the other day of my father wearing that same shirt in 1936 in Paris well and 10 euros ladies aren't wearing is in Hong Kong this is 293 p4 for navigation and that photograph that all these were taken with my box camera and enlarged somewhat that's me there when I used to smoke a little all these guys are radar no Bob would again Benjamin Martin he finally been caught taking a photograph of that I would have been in sea trouble race although the war had ended it was still secret that was an ace canned for picking up fast moving aircraft this this one behind my head was for surface vessels we had arrived in Hong Kong and this is what the time I bought the brownie camera bartered and I started to take photographs on my own account February 46 where we used to go swimming on that particular day there very interesting mr. ho tears the bay and this hotel the leader hotel at that time in 1946 I would have been shot if I had tried to cross the threshold of the hotel because it was reserved entirely for the other classes and for the officers only so tough you couldn't go in but we released week ago on the beach Hong Kong think of Hong Kong now absolutely now it there standing on the highest point and there are masses of God like that now skyscrapers then we had the greatest day Admiral of the fleet Admirals sir Bruce Fraser came to inspect the ship's company and eventually the and the guard of honor the Admiral came round and he chatted to one or two of us when he gets to me and by that time 46 so just before my 18th birthday and looking very young blond blue eyes and very young and he said how long have you been in the Royal Navy I said I hate Iman sir he said do you like it I should know a lot sir and my captain I swear if he could put that sword through me he would you do not tell Admirals that you don't like the Navy very much but he was charming because he said oh you'll get used to it get used to it this was very very sad this was sub-lieutenant Williams do 22 years of age he went ashore in tensing as fit as a fiddle came back onboard not feeling well fell into a coma and died and we was buried at sea and the Sailor there that's my back I was one of the burial party there oh that was I can even pick me out there that's me this is the battle cruiser the the bar floor and we are at we are actually tied up in the Yangtze Kiang yeah the Yellow River and this was a Sunday morning service this is my ship the big Bri Bay and we went on board the battle cruiser for Sunday morning we then spent say 101 and a half years cruising sans luxury Sunday cruising yeah went down to Australia that was always in Australia for three months the ceremony of crossing the line June 1946 a very very old naval tradition is when you cross the line you have to be baptized by father Neptune and here you've got father Neptune and if you've never crossed the lime equator before you get docked in in in a big tub here why you shipmates now I must one day I've thought about it I must one day send these photographs to the city of Darwin because that was Darwin in 1946 I even made a committee at Darwin's jetty exclamation marks the impression I got was I was walking through a Hollywood set for the Western view with dirt roads and this was the cinema right and you might just about see a steel outline of a star it was the star cinema did this was Darwin in the middle of winter in June June 46 in the middle of winter and we were wearing white tropical shorts very very warm right then back to reality we we left Australia after three months refit we went up to Malaysia Brunei Malaya and these photographs I took Himalaya Kuala Lumpur and it looks nothing like that now that was the british malaysian army headquarters that still exists that magnificent building that's still there port dickson in Malaya we had some leave so shore leave and we booked into a camp yeah we're all in that's me my uniform there one monkey me and scouts uniform you don't very often see but that's your the tropical uniform of the Royal Navy so that's me again and that's when I had a body like that now I can tell you nothing like that now yes this I bought this in Japan you've got this pagoda yeah yeah bodies in July the original Kure Japan the place he went to now while we were in curry not a million miles away was Nagasaki and this is the photographs of nagasaki of the devastation of the atom bomb the arts were the interesting thing about this is we hadn't got a clue about radiation i doubt we could have spelt the word understood it so we titled into nagasaki and i in in the rubble i picked up what had been a small green glass bottle and in the heat of the atom bomb it had twisted and melted into a grotesque shape and i also picked up what I believe was a piece of soil it was in a ball it was solid it was solid as a rock but he definitely wasn't a rock and I can only assume the heat of the atom bomb had had some Howard others solidified it changed its its makeup anyway these are souvenirs so I put them in my pocket and I take them back on board hadn't got a clue the danger that I was in but some wonderful ship mate of mine stole both the bottle and the piece of soil I don't know who took it but maybe he saved me yeah we went to Kagoshima and we took on board 14 Japanese war criminals they're guarded by a crew on this occasion but the Australians as well Australian guys they were on board all those 14 war criminals and we took him to Singapore for trial and execution just very briefly one was Japanese had more voice and more oh by the way all these little plaques was their name and a number and on the ship's notice board there wasn't there was a statement which gave the name and number of each one of these men and the crimes that they were had committed and in the reason we had the Australians on board the Admiral was commanding a buffalo ship large partnership they sank an Australian destroyer which went down going down but going down slowly but they took nearly 200 survivors on board and at sea the Japanese get bored we all get a bit bored to see you don't see miles and miles of ocean so they thought it was a good afternoon sport they brought 200 men on to the quarter deck of the battleship they split them up half on the starboard side half on the port side and while one half watched they decapitated about 100 men on the one side and threw the bodies into the sea so we got him this that would this one I hope you can see it he is a Japanese prisoner of war he'd been we had him on board ship Japanese prisoners of war on board as the Working Party and I they were leaving the ship I stood at the bottom of the gangway with my bhavani box camera ready to take photographs of some of them as they came off and he's running at me to try and knock the camera out of my hand okay but I did get the photograph now we're in Damascus Syria this is in Palestine and we we had a cook a boss and we went from Beirut some poor the prisons and poor was supposed supposed supposedly lowered by baskets from there and the great mosque of Takai we went my friends and I went into the gardens of the mosque of Takai oh that's obviously mean uniform and believe it's a lot that is me smoking a whole book of life that is also me and that's a radio radar mechanic together and there was a stall selling these these the Arab geladas and so forth and we couldn't afford it we hadn't got that sort of money and they suggested we'd like to try it on so we tried it on and they took photos you don't want to hear about the oh I do you do you do right well she was used as a troop carrier so we picked her up in Malta Hanlin December the 7th 1947 I was coming home after two and a half years abroad so we were loaded up and there were 2,000 of us in the hangar massive hangars no no aircraft of course so we had our hammocks and we had tables and we were happy little sailors all playing cards and what have you and we have a seven day journey hahaha we thought we were going to have the seven days comfort on the second day out at sea all of us were mustered on the flight deck and we were designated into various working parties and I was designated with a party of about twelve us and they this officer and their leftenant took us down below and to a bomb shaft the bomb lift of like and he said that now the thing is chap is he said we have this we have this bomb lift this is this is where the bomb has come up from the magazine and they they come up to the flight deck and the Bombers are fitted onto the aircraft and as you can see very deep normally there is a small lift that brings the bombs up but there is the steel ladder that goes right the way down he said now if you chappies have a look down there you will see that to quite a considerable depth it's full of because gentlemen the sewers have been leaking into the water shaft he said now we would like you if you would be so kind to get down there and clear the bloody lot up so 12 of us spent one and a half days with buckets and ropes pulling up the sewage we did make a minor complaint I made a minor complaint and said you know a fella can do this could do a fellow a lot of serious arms breathing in all this stinking to say so they've brought in the medical officer and he was the left hand in commander so he was he knew his job and he looked down he said no no no no no not at all no but not bad not bad at all no you'll be all right fellas you'll be all right so we carried on after one and a half days we'd finish the job so on the third day we muster on the quarterdeck again on the flight deck shall we say for another designated job and we were delighted to hear over the megaphone the first thing in the house was will operation stink hole 18 ratings fall out you are excused duty for the rest of the journey to the UK we went back so we didn't have to so that was my memory of the great aircraft carrier 32,000 ton illustrious was cleaning all the sewage out of a bomb shaft [Music] they're wonderful periodically to take them out to look back back through history 50 years 60 years I mean I'm 92 nearly and I started here I was 18 that's a big span they recall very happy memories starting with the ship's crew that took so many photographs of the ship's crew there were great mates there was a I had there was a group of us all radar radar or wireless telegraphy and that there were guys who felt the same as I did you're never going to see this again I never dreamed that many years later I'd be going to these places again including Hong Kong and and the Pacific and the in Asia on business so I took what photographs I could take and I bought photographs where it was impossible for me to take them myself and it's good it's just great it's something to pass on I mean some of my albums start with my great-grandparents so I go the young girl through from great-grandparents right up to the the 21st century wonderful wonderful record and as I've made it very very clear to the good Lord if I can take my albums with me I ain't going [Music] I captured about two hours of interview footage in total and it really felt like weighty important work I love the fact that this stuff is now captured digitally I've got it on hard drives forever and it's been archived and that feels important and I wanted to share more with you as well but obviously in this video I can only fit so much so what I've done is I've done a longer cut of this interview that's about 3540 minutes so if you want to hear more of these stories I will post that video to my youtube channel as well and you're welcome to go and spend some more time with that material I'll post the link at the end of the video my grandfather's photographs make me think about my own work differently I think with a lot of our photography we can be very myopic very in the moment and now so we go out and we take photographs a lot of them and we edit them quickly and we post them quickly because we want that instant feedback from Instagram or anywhere online that tells us we're doing a good job but getting out of that and thinking about things broader his work reminds me that I am NOT just capturing for today but I'm capturing as a legacy for the future as well and how well people in 2070 or 28 or 29 t look back and view the images that I've taken I even think about in terms of the street photography that I'm taking here in London in 2018 and now in 2019 the fact that I'm going around and looking for good light and trying to take images with good composition but the subject matter I sometimes take for granted because I see the same buses and taxis and clothes and cars and and makeup and tattoos and buildings is stuff I'm used to because I walk around every day but when I've taken these images and archived them well and if they survive 30 40 50 years how will people look at those images and where I lived here and now in London it's taken that very narrow view of what I'm doing and spread it a lot wider and a lot deeper into history my grandfather's work has reminded me that I might be or I can be telling stories to future generations if that's how I want to think about my work and it might change the way I shoot it might not change the way I shoot but just having that at the forefront of my mind when I'm shooting adds another dimension another element - how and why I'm capturing these images I mean sitting with him on that sofa well he told me those stories and showed me those images I found an incredibly evocative experience and I've now started to daydream about what might it look like when generations down the line I can sit with or future people can show my images to their kids or grandkids showing them what the time and space that I lived in was like and it's almost like you can become a storyteller through time so I hope if nothing else that gets you thinking about your own photography get you thinking a little bit wider a little bit deeper than just shooting for today to get a little bit of attention what stories could you be capturing what legacy could you be leaving and what sort of images could you leave the world behind and what would you want them to Sean Tucker
