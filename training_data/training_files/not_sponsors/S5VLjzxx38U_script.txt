squarespace so shooting multi-camera absolutely possible absolutely an option absolutely you're much better off with two lesser cameras than one better camera really just get yourself in a backlit situation yeah and then you're going to be fine [Music] what's going on indie mogul my name is ted and today i'm here with nigel blood an amazing cinematographer that has shot not only second unit on things like lord of the rings but he's also shot a lot of episodes of true detective and most recently shooting the indie feature peanut butter falcon amazing movie that's in theaters right now basically what we're going to do today is we're going to walk through the production of shooting peanut butter falcon and indie movie and talk about it not only from the script camera and lenses lighting and then the secret sauce that was added by nigel uh tell me a little bit about this movie what kind of movie was it in the scale of production it's a me i'd say medium-sized independent movie it's a really lovely little film with a great huge amount of heart they're sort of teaming up here for the first time so come out of the cornfield and zach shows shire his secret handshake what kind of secret handshake for what fun dudes friends let's do his first handshake all right let's go hurry up all right three of those four of those one of those don't worry like this shot here this white shot it started to rain so what we did here is you know i shoot a lot of stuff to cameras i i love two cameras oh really yeah i like i love single camera shooting as well but you're really wasting a lot of time a lot of people's time i think a lot of people are scared about two camera shooting because i hear shoot single camera because you can only light for one setup it's symbolic okay so how do we shoot for two cameras well we're gonna learn how to light first visualize the whole scene think where the light's gonna be best for the whole scene not just one shot in the scene and then build around that just get yourself in a backlit situation for the master and then you're going to be fine so why back like having a consistency on the camera side effect of the faces and the side of the face that you're photographing is kind of the same it's still in the shade we've got a child above here he's you know red hat over here and then we've got zach of course over here here we've got of course our cornfield something like this right so what i knew i needed to do is find an edge of a cornfield where they were backward so the sun had to be here and it wasn't there all day it does this so therefore you say okay we can shoot the scene yeah this time until this time yeah this is probably like 2 p.m and this is what like 6 p.m and if it's backlight it can be hard it can be soft and generally speaking everything yeah that's not the same it's it's the oldest rule in the book is you know defusers want everything backlit it's just like they just think they want it looks beautiful it's not about that it's about managing a production and being able to control the sun yeah is why we want to backlit you're going to have to do this and you're going to be able to work very quickly and you're going to give the actors the greatest freedom did you do any tweaks or anything like that was it all actually left there's no idea the only thing i did was hang a lot of dirty in here gotcha there's a lot of duvetyne of course for people that don't know what doubting is it's just black fabric blocks out the sun also take light away from their faces the worst thing you can do on an overcast day is start turning lights on the best thing you can do is start taking light away and shaping it that way i think a big piece of advice especially in this day and age is learn about good two-camera shooting know about what you can do and can't do and what the limitations are the producers go i can't afford two cameras what you bring to a film by just adding a camera and enough crew to run that camera it's so much more so much more than the most of you know it's like you help the schedule so much you help the actors and director and the continuity and the things you can do sure so basically the first thing we do is the master that's why that's a 40 mil make a great frame that actually it can exist within don't you don't try not to move your master jack was over here on a long lens 75. i wouldn't qualify this as an over i could qualify for this as a sub master because it's different than the others is there a reason why you chose to shoot it like that oh yeah i knew the action was going to go down here on around the corner and see my camera's just here just out of frame that's your that's your master master your master is literally just hanging out there yeah it was raining so i knew that if i had the whole scene in masters and we only had it for one rain take then we have enough to pepper it through and have some consistency rather than just relying on the overs which might be all clean with no rain oh so by shooting multi-camera too it gives you more options in case something unpredictable happens like rain or a cloud coming across exactly exactly yeah so that's the first part of the coverage right which is the masters effectively which run the whole scene and then the others one camera here and one camera there we had to use the window of rain as much as we could in this case you scratched the mask on you went with an over the shoulder for both characters as they talked what lens were you using on this they're usually 50 usually about 50. so really i mean this is two setups you shoot one yeah two and then you're out of the scene which is pretty quick you know um and that's amazing you get four angles for two setups that's incredible yeah this would have taken maybe three hours to shoot look this is zach's escape from the old people's home this will just slip out from under your nose you two are close well then you'll figure out where he's at it's a nighttime scene that goes from interior to exterior yeah how do you cover a running scene like this the grip's hit a bicycle which is a big three-wheel bicycle it's nothing custom-made it's just a trike you know so the grip sits here and then there's another seat here on apple box or something for a steady cam operator sit on a city come up right so here's my motor so it's silent it's cheap it's very good for adjusting to a human yeah so in this case we're literally just biking this direction yeah and our elite actor is here and is running this way so the steadicam takes care of the bumps in the road it does and stuff like that and then you get your clean shot of your actor there's not a lot of lighting involved this is all street light no way you know night lighting for me in the digital age is all about lighting to the street so you go to the street at night and you look at what's there look at the color temperature the lights that are there yeah and the lights that you put in make them the same color temperature so it all belongs in one reality you said you didn't use a lot of lighting there's one light here just a little bit of front light so just a little froze here and that's what's on his chest there what we're using there uh would have been a sputnik yeah so just a little sputnik light and that's just giving us a little cast here yeah jumps out the window it's just a very simple scene as well um it's just one light yeah so look go and talk to the street get them to turn their house their windows their lights on the house while you're shooting to add a little texture so there's something there yeah yeah night lighting is about keeping it simple now before we break down our last scene i'll give a quick shout out to squarespace for sponsoring

rough trip they've just built the raft out of a junkyard and they've just pushed off the riverbank right the beginning of their voyage on the water i'm gonna give you all of my wishes for my birthday it's interesting because of it's all it's incredibly emotional scene that we shot basically from behind the characters which is not unusual in itself at all i mean french overs which is what this is french hovers is when you shoot the over from behind the heads rather than the front the actors turning to the other actor and looking straight into their eyes and the camera's here yeah then you're not seeing their eyes but if the camera's here you're seeing their eyes better you're seeing it somewhere is better than if the camera's here the actors tend to go to where the camera is they will tend to open up more to a camera that's you know a french over than they do to come in it's a regular if the camera's here they know they're going to make a decision to come around here one of the reasons i decided to shoot this uh like this is because two reasons they're sitting on the edge of a raft i can't get the camera out in front unless i then have another boat and another crane to get the camera in front of them and i had a certain amount of days i could use a stabilized head only a couple so i know there's some situations i needed a stabilized head to deal with the conditions how ie how fast the boat's moving yeah and some days like here we're in a very calm place i thought well we're gonna be able to do a lot of this handheld and it's also for me a very natural angle because the camera's just on the boat if the camera was hanging off the front it's a movie because it's an impossible kind of angle you know whereas i liked being with them i like being seeing what they're seeing for the first time i like seeing the road ahead so i like mastering it here in this two shot there's a voyage it's about what's in front of them that's what's behind them with these guys we cross covered the the others simple 40mm camera back here which we ran as a single camera yep and then we got in the coverage i put one camera here and one camera here both handheld it's just me sitting cross eagle with my wife over here and and the light's pretty good because again i'm backlit right so the light's here and this was by design absolutely we're going to push the raft off this way to get in the background go up the current this way and yeah and then the the cross shooting is we didn't we didn't have a lot of lenses we didn't have two of anything so one would have been a 50 and one would have been a 60 as usual and we shot the scene in a couple of hours and i like it also just because it's so simple and it's just thought about and considered and it's and it works and you don't need much more than that i don't think you know it's just again just choose less gear and make smart selections and and just less is always always always more challenge your crew to be the smallest the quietest crew because if you lead by that then the rest of the crew won't do that you create a quiet set people can think and do their job well and when you're an actor you don't want to want a bunch of blah blah blah yeah there's a creative process going on and there's a lot of very stressed out people on the edge and it's all about curating that as silently as you can and do more homework than you do on a 100 million film because that's all you have good filmmaking is all about not the tools it's all about how you conceive it and having a point of view and making sure it's consistent holistically shoot the film as a whole you know always shoot everything as a whole see the story as a whole nigel thank you so much for coming on the show really appreciate it uh people
