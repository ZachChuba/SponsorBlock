monsters monsters monsters what is a monster are monsters real is this our monster how about this monster is man the real monster oh that's deep thinking but more importantly what was that noise and why is it so dark in here hello and who's in the closet and what's under this bit and whose room is this and I don't know what happened to your son it was a monster I'd like to go home now please all this and more on this episode of in de correr ante I don't think I can get behind the Ranga tangs I'm not too bothered if they go extinct ah well it's the flaps that bother me oh the flaps that are there appeal oh it's just awful have you ever seen one in real life no IRL what they are amazing they communicate really incredibly with humans they're so cool I love them like look at this shave that bit off yeah now that I'm like focusing on the Arang of I will admit that they are quite unseemly they are unpleasant if I was like in the orangutan world right I would be constantly walking past and just slapping them behind the back of the face flap okay hey Greg what's up Stacey whack just like a little flick as you're walking by okay and I bet it makes it like a real meaty sound like when you slap two palms together I'm imagining this in like a primate high school we're like the chimps and it's the gorillas we'll hang out of the orangutangs and the orangutans are just dead bullied for that flaps it's like soft flaps how's it going no way it's like it's the other way around it's like what you've done to your flat field we've had our flaps for six months now is you know some runt of the litter and he looks in the mirror and he goes what if I never get any flaps what if they never grow fruit and then like an orangutan mob so it covers into there puts her arm around his shoulder it's okay honey you know we all grow at different rates and you'll get your flaps one day your dad didn't get his face flaps until he was at least his dad walks past the bedroom we've just things like enormous in slavic myths baba yaga is a wild woman or dark lady of magic in russian folklore there are many stories about her like most witches baba Yaga can fly but she does not use a broomstick instead she sits in a giant mortar a bowl for grinding food with her knees almost touching her chin terrible form transport she drives very fast across or above the forest floor and used the pestle as a rudder I love it it's one of those things when someone said yeah well have you heard about our folklore I know it's like all the representatives of monster folklore have met for a summer the Slavic guys just like forgotten his notes well we've got this wit right and she can fly oh it's pretty good yeah well I was a witch too okay well it flies on a broomstick our broomstick okay what do you got and then you go uh mines different it's got um and then you just start scanning the kitchen like hold on a minute Poplar judge we love cheese but mortar and pestle that's stupid you can't even you can't stand on a mortar and pestle it's way too smoke big one oh well just looking around the kitchen I love it so buddy it's from the feast of maximum occupancy what is the most monster light of the real animals though I suppose the giant squid the giant squid is the thing of haunting dreams like I can't watch those deep ocean documentaries they are terrifying I too was really annoying about that right I've been in a deeper and being living in the deep ocean I even jumped out of the boat gone swimming deep ocean don't smoke snorkeling I never had any fear of the deep ocean it never occurred to me that I should be afraid of it and then someone started pointing out how afraid they were of the deep ocean and gradually over the last few years I've been cultivating this fear of the deep ocean and born out of nothing it's just because someone else is afraid of something all of a sudden I've started to become afraid of it as well I think you've just gained their rationality I think there's every reason to be scared of the deep ocean it is objectively terrifying is where all the Lovecraftian creatures live you've just come round to sense if you askme stopple ganger monster who's in her picture of leo his doppelganger from Russia of course he was made in a Russian lab to to battle the American movie stars and try and rival them but he got squished up against the test tube and this happened can you get Leo on the phone no he's busy get me his Russian non-union liquid yeah these are just both Chris Pratt that's ridiculous I'm fairly certain yes there's just both Chris Pratt although I headlined his Chris Pratt warns of pervy dude doppelganger that's the exact excuse ideas as well I would say Mothra is a pretty shitty yeah I'm not a fan of that who cares it's big moths in it I mean not good if you lift a lamp on in the house and the door open at night but otherwise fine may I come in so easily defeated to that monster shoot some bb's spirits wings and it's done is light a candle go straight into it I really don't like King Kong no I just think it shows a lack of imagination I don't think that societal sociological commentary about it is very clever either no don't be bad to nature otherwise it'll crush you with this big monkey paw what so it's like a shitty Moby Dick yeah it's like a moby dick Kerr idiots I hope you take for FIFA concrete I don't know man I think I think you can get revenge on nature like doesn't that make perfect sense I mean I could imagine it not an Ahab today we gotta go fight the whale and it's all difficult and you lose your life and hell's heart stab thee and all that [ __ ] but literary historian whoever I read bits of it once I think I heard some sinister references on if we wanted to take revenge on all the whales hunt them all down and kill them we could probably do it like me and you if we take off that sweet YouTube cache get ourselves a ship and we're just like at the pour these guys Sarah higher but why are you going on the seven seas we're on a quest to kill all the whales what is it like your gang like blubber or um and the grits Oh what have you know it's whale genocide clicks fixed yeah we're vlogging it I'm gonna vlog my unending quest to murder all the whales I mean whales are pretty close to monsters at least the blue whales if whales didn't exist they would be monsters if you described a whale in a world where they didn't exist mmm that's a straight monster right there I mean that's very monster like its enormous that's yes yes there is probably like a bus it's so big you know it's too big yeah it's kind of rude that's why they got to die yeah I bet it's really easy like just a couple cyanide pellets like oh here's some krill a little fellow and then just keep swimming just go around the ocean with like a giant wine corks yeah why import a maybe I think they'll blow that one out but if you put like a grenade it's just awesome like the bow of a ship wicking grenades of 3-pointers subwhales I reckon you know there's all these endangered species you know save the whales save the Dolphins blablablabla [ __ ] those guys true true you could save the whales and save the Dolphins or if we just killed them all we wouldn't have to save them like if it's just done yeah probably saves you a bunch of cost don't have to hear about we're damaging the environment will hurt the whale you can have as much sonar as you like we're doing the charity sector a favor by eliminating their problem yeah think of how many resources we could put into other animals or like people if we just yeah kill all the whales I love this song excuse me I love this song is regional to my country that I used or thinking okay I don't know what I'm doing wrong Shadow Man the girls desert what might be pain listen buddy you gotta go out there and be assertive women love a VPN with confidence assertiveness confidence okay so pyrocynical just stole my whole Adam made a low energy version of it hey there my

oh my god lucky guy damn she's smoking I kind of want a VPN now out of the way thoughts I got me a real woman too late now you had your chance I'm gonna cry about it huh here's your drink back yes you should have gotten no hood BPM Nord mermaids we're always supposed to be sort of dangerous weren't they and then they've become kind of sexy yeah but their sexiness is part of their danger was it their whole thing that they like sing and make sailors crash into rocks I think the real question is would you would I know probably no I would be so preoccupied with the existence of a monster how does this happen under what circumstances do we like dating look I found this girl you're gonna love her okay baby all right I'm open-minded you know me come meet her she's just hanging out by the pool ah great yeah no I'm big into swimming and stuff so that's cool yeah cool cool anyway here she is name's Arielle cool name this is ordinary things hi Arielle nice to meet you we just get to talking she's just hands on the rim of the pool I'm unaware at this stage the connection is made so that's all all the go hmm so you guys carry it's all going very well it just is you know you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime you said yes wow that's really great and then she pops her hands up on the side of the ball and she lifts up her big tail what do you say you have a tail I hate to appear shallow but you know I can get past the tail I mean I shouldn't be so prejudiced perhaps maybe I should open my life up to attention I'm venting a nautical creature so there she is standing on the bridge can't wait to see you you guys have just matched on tinder right she looks great from that distance from the bridge and you walk up to the bridge and she turns to me and she goes Oh ordinary things it's so great to meet you terrific it's such a pleasure to meet you oh my god we've got so much in common what do you say second date sure I'm gonna take my shallow hat off and just be like this could be useful there are practical advantages to going out with a girl who has cat but yeah she can reach stuff reached up jump up and grab stuff she probably has excellent hygiene yeah that's very clean I think she's slightly offended by that beggars can't be choosers though I feel like this this girl's probably by lucky in love I cannot believe you are saying this this fine young lady and she doesn't lick herself right she just cleans herself in the shower like a normal person have you ever smelt a wet cat that's no good what say you cat or mermaid what's better I think it would the fish would smell and also you're stuck beside the water cat is more practical for getting around I mean Catwoman is a character I feel like cat ladies are often sexualized in media which is strange now I think about it yes so you would be willing to live with care no no I'm gonna be honest with you now and to say that like I think all animal-human hybrids I'm gonna say it I know characters politically incorrect animal-human hybrids not for me this is outrageous people are gonna be offended by that's right cancelled ordinary things I know we've been going out for two weeks I'm starting to develop feelings for you and I have to tell you something what is it I just have to come out and show you it's about my hooves what behooves you don't either what do you mean well look at these look at these babies wow that's a lot to take in that's almost acceptable if you kept some shoes on I could live with that I could live with that yeah I think that's all right these look like they fit into a high heel that's true I think it would all come to a head when you're a social gathering with her you're right the beach or something and everyone's taking their shoes off and you just be like do you do you leave your plimsolls on your Doc Martens but we're at the beach yeah that's right and that's where the relationship really falls partly I just don't want people to know that you've got deer hooves sorry it's just great climate look great climate yeah so at their climbing gym she is she's looking good what about if it's like this that's freaky I'm scared of that to be honest you don't like that you're gonna get hoofed into next week with those babies you know she's saying oh you know let's go on a second date but she goes wait I'll do things this just I think got to know what's that this okay that is a big tail I think I could get past the tail nice alright because you know what it's an addition rather than a substitution squirrel girl I will call her she hates them she hates a removal over you would always have an ample supply of nuts and that is for me a big bonus you'd be like in the park and you just be like I could really go some pecans right now and she would be like no don't worry about it I've got a sorted she just borrow okay what you want hazelnut walnut pecan stash - I got everything she'll on shell off sure I mean pokemons are monsters their pocket monsters aren't they well they must be that's in the name Pokemon Pokemon monsters oh wait that's Digimon okay I'm gonna read you some names of some new Pokemon oh go on you're gonna do that and I'm going to draw what I think it looks like as well okay I'm gonna go over a new one I said this Pokemon is called ray quizar rake wassup ray quiz are I'm gonna guess it felt like that it's not but go with it okay okay I've got some facts for you to help okay yes first clue okay so one of its powers is Dragon Claw rake was a something like that and then it's got like an eye yeah like a big strong body as a star this is pretty good it's good like a big tail and funny little arms you don't you're not far off quite really yeah you're nothing that's nice that's the first as a guess is pretty good okay you sort of got off track a bit now but it's still good keep going okay okay hold on what do you say it did okay so it's got a Dragon Claw power and it lives in the ozone layer far above the clouds and cannot be seen from the ground Oh apparently then it needs to have wings little flying rat boy I'll put it in a cage in a blue hand wet market this guy's got spunk he's gonna character Hollander so he's got he can run really fast okay so he's more like this rate quiz ah sounds like if someone tried to do like a funny quiz team name and they couldn't quite figure out they like panicked no no game yeah they thought it was a pun and I thought about longer and then we all should have just gone with a Dolf quiz low like all the time okay am i close is that rake was uh okay it's snake boy girl flying snake boy tune in next week for another product I mean Pokemon the you to purchase his power will be um quasar a quasar right I got a card here called cricket hoon yeah and his power is improvisational performance is it like improv he just puts on a little black turtleneck and he's just like has anyone got any suggestions new powers I think I heard psychiatrist and I think it did go something like this it's amazing I think improv is the lowest form of comedy I hate it even though technically that's what we're doing I mean I feel more like hey improvisational theater comedy oh my god I can't believe you brought your baby to rock climbing class no I didn't just cope with it Steven why did you got free lessons and rock climbing from your dead uncle you are incorrect anyway here's a box this is really unfortunate exhale is anyone else really sweaty just I takes off his turtleneck the staff anyway yeah my name's Steve oh wait no I'm supposed to everyone something it's Stevie you can't even think of a different name something walks in the room you're dead what what you are dead this please to start crying just in him in the fetal position just like I'd funny tell me I'm funny I love Steve the improv he's the bit he needs to be like a recurring character he's brilliant because you can just pull him out whenever you're struggling what's the deal with stage lighting am i right guys it shines on you and make you feel warm I suppose it does light up here do aliens count as monsters or are they as separate categories I think they're a separate category although I think some aliens have been monster fired definitely you can have aliens that are monsters but only if they're not anthropomorphic like the aliens from alien they're monsters totally but then the aliens from signs I don't think a monsters who interested aliens yeah I think I'd agree with that [Music] what about uh what's that one horn mouth man horn mouth like that SCP horn head I'm getting closer siren head siren out like that you don't know that siren head no he's the new hip monster oh yeah like I like this this is good yeah Wow look at that Bri that's real - ah good to know I'm scared [Applause] [Music] very good very good so what do you think of this monster I think it's very much of our time see I like this kind of monster because because it's a monster that reflects societal fears it's a the fear of technology technology what oh yeah I mean I don you terrified of horns it's so loud I know hurt my ears that guy is giving everyone tinnitus in like a radius you know what he looks like some kind of radio tower it's almost boxes yeah you look at him from a distance and you can't I mean you can sort of you figure out a shape and everything but there's an innate mystery around it like how does he work where is he from yeah like it's the intrigue of it that's brilliant you immediately want to know more and you know that it's threatening and terrifying I think you've really gotten down to some in there because the best monsters are those that have a backstory the one that just that you get to fill in mmm like Slenderman for example yeah the more there gets fleshed out the worse it gets they made it Slender Man movie who gives a [ __ ] like I don't want to watch that I just want to think about Slenderman and that's why siren head is gray it's just like all you want is a 10 second clip I like it yeah - yeah well it's one of this SCPs there's a lot of quite good scps yes remind me what that stands for secure contain particular yes yes I hope this isn't too much like hyperbole but I think it is one of the best writing by committee group pieces of literature since the Bible I agree oh I know what to do ordinary things just had a spontaneous idea not planned ahead of time let's draw of the ultimate monster I'll draw it and you describe what it's like that sounds great let's do it I see a monster with like the two big teeth that start from the bottom jaw and are so big almost like he has a moustache made of teeth yeah that's pretty spooky one eye I reckon pretty scary so far we've got the Cyclops with dental problems I see him that they make more bear like he's got like a bear body ok so who's got like bear knows yeah I've drawn like a cute kitten this is more like a teddy bear but I'll go with it oh but but with spikes yes right it got spicy - I have spikes he's got like a bear body no I think we should take some Slenderman and just give him a suit oh yes ok ok suit this isn't super scary I'll be guys know if you saw it in an alleyway you'd be this guy yeah that was on the end of your bed you go to a McDonald's bathroom and this guy's just standing here and all beside you just giving you looks unnerve a big monobrow no what's his superpower the quasar ray I think he eats humans ok he eats humans but like because he's got a business suit it suggests he's a little bit more like sophisticated yeah so he does it with like a knife and fork yeah ok what's his name what's this monster called ray was let's ask Steve The Improv dude he'll no bear knife Fork spider legs that's it spider legs but like daddy longlegs legs oh man this is good it's a good monster I'm pretty pretty pleased with this sucker that's how he walks around well give them a real name I think how do people name monsters normally it's true vampire succubus Frankenstein meant oh the monster oh I like Mentos Mentos cuz he's also got mind powers one of his mind powers is to hypnotize you with his big eye right and then you just get on you get on his right and just heats you without the flame oh I like that yeah it's it's Mentos but the Oh is a spiral oh yeah mentor like hypnosis and his weakness is coca-cola and like I like to think that he haunts the backstage or theaters sort of like a bit of Phantom of the Opera style oh that's quite good yeah he was an actor who never made it and so he only eats other actors as revenge wait hang on I just imagine the stage manager of this theater where Mentos dibs just like okay everyone who's got some beautiful a few basic safety things to go over the fire exits of this way you need to line up outside if you ever hear the alarm and also carry coca-cola with you at all times because Mentos is lurking around and he will eat your organs and his legs don't actually make the noise but he does cuz he's fee at Racal he's an out-of-work actor so he's always just going like oh dude I love that that that actually is kind of creepy like he thinks that whenever he kills someone for real it's like part of some play he's like oh yeah right you're that character and tempest or something Minto SCP four five six seven I'm creative just just um make this an SCP right it's [ __ ] brilliant and if they delete it all the mods come along just make it again just put it somewhere else just keep hiding mentor mentor deserves to be an SCP thank you [Music] maybe it was like the Opie and Anthony show something like that they had this guy and he was talking about how he was in Iraq during the Gulf War and he said he basically saw a monster and not like him like oh my god this man has become a much like he said he saw a monster it had a guy chest it was like this high glowing eyes almost like a horse but a wolf but a guy the thing he described as he says it looked like a werewolf it had four feet it was a werewolf I reckon what he saw was an escaped bear from the zoo and it was shaved it was shaved a shame who's who's out there shaven by us I think that they had shaved a bear this is what a bear looks like without its fur oh I could see why people would think that was aware with if you saw that in the dark you would think like that is a man transforming into a wolf like mid-transition yeah it's amazing how much they look like like cats or rabbits like they will have the same sort of physiology once there yeah all nude once your favorite monster just like off the top of you down you've got no time to think about it as much as people are gonna like the stance of Slenderman Slenderman see I don't know much about Slenderman Oh watch out boy oh he's gonna get you right so he's got no face right he's tall yeah wears a nice suit but don't look at his face so what happens if you look into his face everything I'll go staticky like this yeah and then you'll disappear and I believe you join his child army is there like Joseph Kony and his child solders or something exactly I don't exactly know how it works so he's a bit of a Pied Piper type figure he steals kids yes okay yeah exact I'm not know how creepy is the Pied Piper story do you remember getting told that story of the kid is that the one about him leading all the rats out of the town this is how I remember it going oh my god is rats everywhere I don't think well I think we have to do something about these rats I think it's on at the door hello everyone I'm the Pied Piper I've got a solution for your rat problem oh yeah God he's dressed like Lyle Langley from The Simpsons I've got this magic Lieut and I'll play it and all the rats will follow me oh really yeah yeah I'll definitely work um all I ask is that you give me a lot of gold when I'm done uh all right we'll see what we can do great great I might and then he leaves the room and the townspeople are just like what free yeah you could see snow pebbles conch sounded like I mean I have a flute on him he was dressed like a pervert but true to his word get all the rats and all the rats start following him maybe doing a dance our town doesn't lead him off a cliff oh he does doesn't yes that's right yeah I think so yeah I like to imagine that he just like is playing play bank gets really hosting the clip and then just like at the last minute tactically jumps behind a bush or something a conveniently placed first the spins on this heel 23 skidoo Solid Snake's into a cardboard box yeah he's gone where did he go ah doesn't matter all of the music he walks back into the town meeting alright guys where's my gold all these guys are still discussing what is Nick I think that's like well you've got rid of the rats now so why should we pay you I think that just pricks I think that's the story there might be more of a reasoning to it the mayor reneged on his promise and refuses I will not pay you Pied Piper despite your very neat hat and I refused to pay the full sum which is 50 guilders which once adjusted for inflation we we had it adjusted for inflation it was there it's in brackets look at the screenshot here it is I don't know it's just what Wikipedia said anyway it's 14 billion dollars shut up I am livid I shall take my revenge in the most reasonable manner I can a grand act of child genocide via a musical number the piper returned dressed in green as all hunters are nice outfit change well level does add in the the spring in my step music as he gets changed kids I've got I've got a track for you that you're not gonna believe a hundred and thirty children followed him out of town as a precise number 130 I guess it was told like it must have been a real story some versions state that the piper returned the children after payment to townspeople then went oh [ __ ] okay hold on wait wait wait here's your gold and then he went Yeah right I was really set on murdering all your children but seeing as you've given me the money I guess I can can be the bigger man the heme land street named unpronounceable street with the drums is believed to be the last place the children were ever seen ever since musical dancing is not allowed on that street that's great that's good that's a great story that's like a lot of good storytelling in that you can see how why it's lasted the test of time oh sorry ordinary things I'm going into a tunnel I am also going into a tunnel a separate one though from the one you're going into oh no no actually I'm going into an elevator I and I've got I've got to go now goodbye you just stay there I've also I have a call with my great aunt about her will so I also have to read oh sorry Steve the in from through here you don't your did Lord
