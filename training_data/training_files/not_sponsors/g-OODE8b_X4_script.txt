okay so in our last update on the lmg lounge slash employee happiness center we got this place pretty much ready to watch movies 77-inch tv from samsung 950 series super high-end sound soundbar from samsung with surround we've got the couches in now these are freaking awesome the only problem is that what are the odds that you guys are going to hang around at the end of the day and watch a movie together not good yeah not good so today because we are constantly tinkering with things it's like a compulsion we are getting this place gaming ready and when i say gaming i don't mean like some uh pc master race blah blah blah oh no xbox for life it's faster it's easier whatever no no no everything okay playstation 4 pro xbox one x nintendo switch pc obviously and we are changing out the tv we're actually going down in size from 77 to 65 inches but this right here is one of the first ones oh to go outside of asus headquarters this is a bfgd a big  gaming display excuse me i mean big format gaming display [Music] glasswire at the link below we got the checklist right here the to do streams this is terrible this is great no i mean yeah your energy is terrible first thing we're going to do we're going to cross that off we're going to deal with the receiver later so actually dbrand hooked us right up with a whole bunch of this console gaming stuff because let's face it we're going to spend our money on consoles okay there's a there's a touch of pcmr mentality around here we weren't going to do that so uh you do game consoles and james and i will do um grown men things and we will get the tv unpacked and mounted to the wall i hope you're not expecting a lot from me i only signed up for exactly what's happening right now yeah let's go james come on come on okay oh i just heard the tape coming off the wall it's like this is a velcro mount or what should be fine um maybe just over there against the wall uh or it could be balanced on top of these boxes what put that soft-ass blanket down and we can just put it on the floor yeah just no no just yeah yeah yeah yeah there we go no just yeah yeah just no yeah no yeah yeah yeah no no no yeah [Music] oh so what's so exciting about this thing for us is the fact that bfgd's are able to not only run at 4k but they can do it at 120 hertz with g-sync on a supported graphics card and they have extremely low input leg so if we were playing like super mario world for example is a game that is just almost impossible for me as a kid who grew up playing it on a crt to play on a modern tv theoretically this should be able to handle that just fine because it'll have nearly imperceptible input lag super excited about this this thing is so girthy oh man oh she's deep thick hold on hold on hold on you can't pull it away from me it has a stand on it already now that is tool-less setup other than you two i guess wow awesome oh yeah that's right i didn't even mention that before so we are going to put a vr setup into this little pseudo living room as well so that was the reason that we put a plug up there so we can run our lighthouses without having to deal with any cable wiring mess the stand on this tv is probably like half of the weight really oh my god this is pretty dank yeah i know doesn't it look sick it looks floral like you said it looks good i had it on my v30 it looked awesome yeah yeah that's moderately sturdy i hate ladders beats the former wow i just got that i was like what the are you what is the what was the ladder oh damn it what do you reckon i reckon i'll be all right mate that is a very long screw for how heavy that thing is we gotta make sure it's tight because once there's a bump and sub in here we don't want it to vibrate away what kind of sub did you get 500 watt 15 inch sub yeah yeah i never knew that the bfd would be so b yeah it's really thick it's a thick boy oh lord heat coming it might be a little high now for this uh that's where it goes [Music] oh no one more one more yeah [Applause] [Music] so i totally forgot about this what we haven't torn down the world's fastest gaming machine yet oh is that 2080 ti this is two 20 80 tis with a 9900k it's this is literally as fast as it gets yeah all right and conveniently uh because asus hooked us up with this monitor it's not full of like msi stuff oh so that worked out this monitor wait it does have an msi motherboard if i recall correctly yeah it does but asus graphics card so there you go i'm totally in the way oh you're probably gonna need uh this your mom's favorite cable dp wow don't put that in the video it's going to go in the video now it goes in everywhere so one of the things that you need in order to run the vive wirelessly is one of these puppies so this uses 60 gigahertz wireless which is the only wireless connection that's fast enough and low latency enough to handle like vr gaming without a wire what was our plan for uh all these hdmi devices well the soundbar has hdmi switching right yeah it's got a couple inputs but that's it i think all right so we got to use the receiver good thing we have a harmony yeah so this is like pretty much the best like money for performance 7.2 channel you can get cool just perfect for the 5.1.2 setup we'll be doing later nice oh cable managing all this is gonna kind of suck i'm just working on my 13th controller over here oh my god i almost pulled the linus oh my god look at this these almost look like they're little like hi my name is name tags just right on there uh do you mind moving back a little bit that whole table i need room for my ass your ass nothing about vr makes you look like not a nerd how do i look um like a big nerd like not not a nerd wow like rudolph the like nerd nose mask wearing nerd so uh what's going on i straight up cannot figure out how to turn this display on because it's the switch yeah but like then what there's buttons on the bottom yeah i see the buttons but like they don't do anything did you plug everything in properly he had the hdmi plugged in hey yeah okay republic of gamers let's hit it hey hey all right meg oh it's msi's stupid they think they're rog but it's msi elite gaming i don't know something meg okay so i come bearing networking things i figure we go hardline for everything right that's pretty nice hell yeah uh it's not gonna be long enough that one is that one's not gonna reach i'm not gonna lie it looks like the people over there are having way more fun than us hey pay attention i think maybe it's not gonna ever fall off i think i need a linus tech tips cable tie hey wow this feels very sturdy are you being sarcastic it feels okay to me no oh okay do you find these tips helpful no i don't leave i don't know how this is yeah okay switch other switch one more different switch done d brand done thanks d brand i think we need to like actually play some video games yeah good luck all right your device is ready to go boom uh these controllers suck uh do we have an xbox dongle in there oh wait are you saying you get the xbox one yeah there are enough playstation controllers for everybody he could use one we all got one why would i want one of those why would we why would we i don't want one give me an xbox one i'm gonna go into device manager and disable the xbox dom can you not it's not even working is there gonna be any rules or regulations about washing your hands before you use controllers or are we just going to have a disgusting mess of greasy controllers we're probably going to have a disgusting mess of greasy controllers and i'll put some wet wipes over there i'm never coming here whoa i have a rocket launcher i have a flame thrower and a headbutt and a bomb are there even bad guys in this game yeah like

oh that doesn't that looks like a network connection thing it looks pretty dope though yeah it's pretty cool [Music] oh supply bin oh there's enemies you should put it in single fire mode yeah what was it about again are you sure you're still in verse b oh there you go oh oh oh i suck indeed oh no and we're both down you're done bud can we revive each other no probably not so much hey i'm going to stay behind this shoe that guy has a gold shield though so he can revive himself after and we're lagging again oh no and you're dead i'm dead that's it that's all you want to play yeah i'm done i can't blame the gear at least though can we get a review out of ten of apex legends apex legends you know what jury is out for me but i am loving this setup that wasn't out of 10. this is pretty sick i'm loving it honestly even though i we haven't actually played any games that i'm particularly good at like broforce i was playing a little while ago on my tv at home which does not have great input like makes such a big difference yeah the input delay on this is awesome i didn't even think about it it's that in 10 credit or towards a new phone in the ting shop so thanks for watching guys if you
