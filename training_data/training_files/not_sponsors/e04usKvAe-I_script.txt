[Music] egg drop soup i'm going to show you how easy it is to make cheaper better and healthier than what you would get at a chinese takeout place so stick around [Music] and yeah that's it let's get back into the recipe so we'll begin the recipe with green onions and we're going to use two stalks basically i'm just going to show you a couple different ways to cut the green onions different angles and everything like that there's three sections really when you look at green onions so you've got the dark green section and i like to cut those just at an angle as you can see here and then there's the second section which is the kind of the lighter green section and i like to cut those a little bit different i'll show you that in a second and then the third section is just the white part so you don't want to waste any of it obviously but basically you can see right here the green part separate those out just cutting those at an angle then the lighter green part um basically just cut them like almost butterfly them in half and then unfold them like that and then you can see as well you'll just cut these at like a really like a long angle and these kind of get really really curly which is kind of a cool garnish and stuff for um you know different dishes and then for the white part basically what i like to do is just cut those into almost like really tiny onion rings which is kind of cool looking so you can see that right here just cut them out of you know straight on um no angle or anything and just cut them as thin as possible and that's it so i just want to show you all three different ways to cut onions just because you know it's why not it's kind of kind of fun kind of cool for the middle section i like to uh put them in a little bit of ice water and that's just gonna help them kind of curl up like i was saying earlier these get really really curly and they look really cool like for different types of dishes for the white part just put those in like a small tupperware container you can just keep those in the fridge for a couple days you can use them for whatever you'd like and for the regular green onion that is what we're going to the green part of the onion actually that's what we're going to be using for the soup so i just put those in a bowl so i'm off to the side and for these after they've sat in the water for about um about five minutes you can just go ahead and strain them out and you can see right here like i said they kind of curled up a little bit which is really cool and i just like to save these just put them off to the side and use them for like i said a garnish for anything really [Music] right here i've got half a pound of chicken and i'm using uh white meat which is the breast if you want to use dark meat honestly i prefer dark meat but my wife doesn't really like dark meat which is crazy i know but i i'm using a white meat for for that purpose but if you want to use dark meat by all means definitely do that so we're just going to use a half pound uh or eight ounces of white meat or dark meat chicken and just cut them into small like small little cube pieces and that's it [Music] in a medium-sized pot over medium-high heat you're gonna put about a half a tablespoon of vegetable oil and then just go ahead and throw the chicken in basically you're just gonna try and brown it a little bit once the chicken is brown you're gonna go in with four cups of water or chicken stock if you have it or if you prefer to use chicken stock but what i like to do is four cups of water and then i use these caldo de pollo which is like a chicken chicken base um soup and i'm just gonna put two cubes in there [Music] to thicken up the soup you're gonna use two tablespoons of cornstarch to two tablespoons of water and basically you're just gonna mix it up it's called a slurry and this is gonna thicken up the soup [Music] all right and now for the egg part so we're gonna use two whole eggs and just crack those into a small bowl and whisk them up until they're completely uh mixed [Music] now while the soup is boiling you're just gonna slowly stream those eggs in i like to kind of pour pour a little bit in and then kind of let it sink to the bottom and then stir slowly and then do the same thing repeat the process usually three to four times and then you'll until you run out of egg and the last little touch which is like the secret to that chinese style takeout uh egg drop soup is sesame oil so just put about one tablespoon or actually probably about half a tablespoon of sesame oil this stuff is really really strong so you don't want to go you know you don't want to put too much as far as the soup goes that's it so i mean you can serve this up and enjoy it just pour it into a bowl and top it with a little bit of the green onion but if you stick around a little bit longer i'm going to show you guys how to make those like little crispy wonton chips because it's actually really really easy and if you look if you watched my gyoza recipe then you should have these left over and if you don't have them left over then you know you can go out and buy them most grocery stores have them it's just these little dumpling wrappers and they make square ones which are a little better for this but i've got the round ones because i was making gyoza so basically you just cut them in half and then cut them into little strips and then on you know on the stove just get a little pan or pot with a vegetable oil or a neutral oil of your choice and you're gonna heat that up until it gets to about 325 degrees and these just like they're covered in cornstarch so they actually split up really easily so once you cut those into the strips and the oil is hot you can basically just throw them in and they will just fry up really crispy like chips it's basically the same thing as making tortilla chips but instead of obviously instead of corn tortilla you're using these little wonton skins which are essentially just pasta this is how i like to check and see if the oil is hot enough but just kind of drop one in and you can see how it bubbled like that and that's how you know all right well the oil's ready so just go ahead and throw them all in just be careful not to splash it on yourself obviously [Music] [Music] once they reach like a golden brown crispy color you just pull them out and that's it i mean serve them on the side of the soup and enjoy [Music] all right so there you go with five simple ingredients you've got better egg drop soup than you can get at the chinese takeout
