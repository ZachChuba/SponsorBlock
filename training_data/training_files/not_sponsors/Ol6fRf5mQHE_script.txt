this week we have hit a monumental milestone 6-1 666666 66 subscribers we hit a hundred thousand subscribers we cut our silver play button and gave it away to you guys when we hit 250,000 subscribers we made a carbon-fibre and the next logical milestone was 666666 six subscribers so what we're doing for that one we're cutting an obsidian play bun out of obsidian I've been waiting for this moment since the day we started this channel that is why we started the channel literally been in my journal have been writing about this day what happened obsidian is really brittle and it exploded but we did make a mini knife whoo you could cut atoms with that someone said the nuclear bombs actually have a little piece of obsidian in there and when it detonates it cuts an atom in half and that's what makes nuclear explosions all we need is one atom and we can make a nuclear bomb I can't even shave my arm hairs with this so it shattered like glass in hindsight we should have seen that coming but we're just going to continue cutting through this and maybe we can put all the pieces together once it's all cut out we'll use some special glue or something [Music] you done yet pretty clean how bad is it just don't have it fall on the tank and broken twain okay just two pieces that's not as bad as I thought it was gonna be and she'll had some superglue in his wallet that's gluey does it say on the tube that it'll work with obsidian it doesn't say that it won't my finger to it that's a OH lay it down well that's just gonna glue it to the board huh yeah make that side is like flat and flush as possible now just hold it for like three hours if you look the glue it might set faster 200 and if the obsidian doesn't work then we've got a really custom one-of-a-kind plywood play button the glue kind of worked but this backside is pretty rough-looking so we're gonna try and cut it right along there and see if we can flatten that up [Music] and looks bad it's not as bad as I thought it was gonna be that line right there that that was our bed we accidentally stopped the water jet so it like sat there for a solid two minutes without moving and then this part right there once the water jet went through here it kind of fanned out in this opening so that the stream was super wide but at least it's still smooth there and that still does look cool as long as we keep it wet it it looks pretty cool it's got the two gouges in it but you can see a bunch of lines through the obsidian I call it a success I always call it a success even if we fail because success is in it's like an anagram we've got three play buttons now the 100 subscriber play button the 1000 subscriber play button and the 666666 six play button it looks an awful lot like the 1000 subscriber button it's thicker though so there's some added value there okay that makes sense we're gonna be giving these two away to you guys our viewers and then this one will be given away to our patreon supporters and we are starting a clients come after me yeah no worries thank you to all 666666 subscribers that we have and here's to the next 333333 hit our next monumental step unless we do another one at eight hundred and eighty eight thousand seven hundred and seventy seven that's pretty lucky about nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine nine we should do that [Music]
