hello and welcome to nasa's post splashdown press conference as we celebrate the conclusion of the historic dm2 mission and as we officially return human space flight to american soil i'm bettina inclone and coming to you from nasa's johnson space center nasa astronauts bob benkin and doug hurley spent nine weeks aboard the international space station traveling 27.1 million miles in orbiting earth over a thousand and 24 times and today our crew is home splashing down 45 years and nine days after the last americans splashed down on earth moments ago our two favorite space dads splashed down off the coast of pensacola and in aboard the spacex crew dragon thus concluding our first launch america mission this historic landing marked the first return of commercially built and operated american spacecraft from the international space station to discuss this historic mission more talk more about launch america and what we have in store for nasa is we have our briefers let me introduce them first our nasa administrator jim breidenstein gwen shotwell president and ceo of spacex steve stitch commercial crew program manager joe moltalbano international space station program manager and the entire crew of spacex crew one nasa astronaut mike hopkins victor glover shannon walker and jaxa astronaut sochi naguchi who are quarantined together and are speaking to us today so we'll start with opening remarks and we'll take questions for reporters who have dialed in as a reminder please press star one to ask your questions we'll also be to him taking questions from the public who have used the hashtag ask nasa let's begin jim opening remarks well thank you bettina this was a great day for nasa and a great day for the united states of america i want to thank um our our spacex partners and of course the commercial crew program here at nasa what an amazing day today we really made history um we are entering a new era of human space flight where nasa is no longer the purchaser owner and operator of all the hardware we are going to be a customer one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial marketplace for human space flight to low earth orbit but we also want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation and safety driving down costs and increasing access to space in a way that's never been seen before so this is really an amazing day but we also need to remember that this is just the beginning now is the time to capitalize on all of the great programs that have recently been established to include going sustainably to the moon under a program we call artemis which is on my shirt when we think about the artemis program we're going to the moon sustainably we're going to go with commercial partners and international partners we're going to use the resources of the moon to learn how to live and work on another world for long periods of time we're going to take all of that knowledge and we're going to go to mars this is an amazing moment and the commercial crew program has really just proven the business model for how we go forward and we do more than we're than we've ever been able to do before so i just want to say congratulations to spacex and elon musk congratulations to gwen shotwell and and certainly congratulations to the entire nasa team which has worked so diligently on this for so many years it was really really a remarkable day it couldn't have gone any better and i look forward to getting into the questions thank you jim next we'll go to gwen bob and doug for the honor that you have given us to be able to be here today and have this great achievement i also have to do a call out to the spacex the great spacex team they did extraordinary work this was an incredibly smooth mission i'm sure we'll go into the little foibles that that we did experience over the 62 days here in the q a but i do think it's important to point out that this was an extraordinary mission an extraordinary day for nasa for spacex frankly for americans and anyone interested in in space flight as jim mentioned this is really just the beginning we are starting the journey uh of bringing people regularly to and from low earth orbit and on to the moon and then ultimately on to mars so today is a great day we should celebrate what we all accomplished here today bringing bob and doug back but we should also think about this as a springboard to doing even harder things with the artemis program and then of course moving on to mars thank you gwen we'll go on to steve steve stitch thank you bettina it really is a great day i'm almost speechless as to how well things went today with the deorbit and uh entry and landing and recovery of bob and doug you know we really came into today we had three real objectives of the flight objectives really to execute the deorbit and entry uh of the dragon capsule uh to demonstrate that we could successfully recover that capsule and then that we could also uh bring back cargo from space there's some valuable science that we brought back into freezers on board the dragon vehicle and i think we demonstrated all three of those things today it was just an incredible day i i can't thank enough the men and women across the country from spacex and nasa uh who work so tirelessly over five years to make this day happen to make the whole mission go smoothly it was just a great effort i would like to thank the iss program and the partnership as well today we had a perfect day to land the wind was about two miles an hour at landing in a clear day with no waves and the work that we did with with kenny todd and the space station program and actually jaxa who moved a cargo vehicle to allow us to have this day i'm i'm so thankful for that you know uh the whole part of the orbit entry went very nominally the entry was uh as expected uh the parachute performance was great the drugs deployed as we expected the mains we touched down just fine we did have one uh slight issue as we were bringing the vehicle back on to the onto the ship uh we noticed a few a slight uh toxic vapors and for uh oxidizer and so they were slightly with they were within limits where we could have actually safely had to got the crew out we took a little time to do a purge to purge those vapors out and to make sure that bob and doug were safe we actually took a few readings inside the cabin as well so just an incredible day when i left the console the helicopter had landed on on the ship and ready to take bob and doug back to shore and bob and doug were out of the capsule getting uh some medical check out so things were going very well so again incredible day and thanks to our team and all the hard work to make it make this happen thank you steve joel thank you and welcome again to the post splashdown press brief what an outstanding day that we saw today just incredible for 60 plus days bob and doug the spacex team the commercial crew program uh spacex vehicle were on board doing critical science for us bob and doug completed over 110 hours of science utilization research technology development work that will help this great laboratory that we have help us in low earth orbit and allow us to go to the moon into mars and with the artemis program just an incredible day and this is just a small window to what we'll see in the future today this mission had two crew members we'll have four crew members and allowing us to do an incredible amount of science and research and technology development on board so a huge thanks to the spacex team a congratulations to the spacex team a congratulations to the commercial crew program and just a congratulations to all involved in human space flight with that thank you very much and back to you bettina thank you joel and now let's introduce again the crew one team over to you guys thanks for tina hey on behalf of crew one and our families we want to say uh congratulations to bob and doug and their families you've heard it already but today was a big day it was a big day for our nation it was a big day for for nasa for human space flight for spacex and for our international partners we've had an opportunity to to witness all of the work and dedication that it's taken to pull off the dm2 mission and it's been truly impressive and inspiring as you can imagine crew one we've got big smiles on our face from what we saw from the dn2 the dm2 mission i said this after the launch and i'm going to say it again after watching splashdown it did not seem like this was the first nasa spacex mission with astronauts on board it seemed to go extremely smooth but we also realized there's a lot of work to go we need to look at the data but again overall things seem to go very very very well and then uh just a little bit on crew one our we are wrapping up our training uh later earlier this week we had a chance to see the crew one capsule and it's a beautiful vehicle and we can't wait to have an opportunity to take it into space but again today is is really about dm2 and next successful mission uh bob and doug and your families congratulations thank you mike and we are all really excited to to celebrate when your crew launches up to the international space station with that we'll start with questions from the media again press star one to ask a question our first question comes from lauren grush hi thank you so much for taking my question um obviously a lot of us took note of all of the boats that were surrounding the crew dragon at landing so i'm very curious how that was allowed to happen and what nasa and spacex plan to do to prevent that in the future i'm assuming that can get quite dangerous if not um you know treated properly thank you so i'll i'll talk about it for a second and then i'll turn it over to steve um yeah so that that was uh not what we were anticipating um of course we we wanted to make sure that there was a clearing for them to land the coast guard did an excellent job of of ensuring that and then of course after they landed the boats just came in and we need to do a better job next time for sure i will tell you it's a beautiful sunny day and a lot of boaters were out there and they were certainly intrigued i think all of america was was very anxious to to see the capsule land in the water um but yeah it's uh it's it's something that we need to do better next time yeah i'll just add a couple things we do clear that area we have like a 10 nautical mile area that we clear we have a couple of coast guard cutters out there that were clear in the area and they did an excellent job it was totally clear for the actual splashdown event and then i think as jim said it was just a beautiful day lots of people out maybe boating or fishing and then saw the capsule and kind of came in and we we have some work to do with spacex we'll work together to do a better job for the next splashdown great thank you so much um um our next question comes from chris davenport uh congrats on on a great mission uh i'm just wondering if you had any updates on bob and doug it looked like they were feeling well but just any updates on their health and how they're doing thanks and again congrats everyone i know when i left the control center bob and doug were doing well you know we kind of watched them in the capsule they were they were moving around and looking at displays we asked asked them to take a few readings to make sure the cabin was fine uh we had gotten them out and they were going through medical checks and all indications where they're doing well the plan from now the rest of the day uh some helicopters will take them off the ship to a pensacola naval air station and then they'll return to houston tonight and looking forward to seeing them when they get here it's it's been a great flight thank you for that question chris i know we're all anxious to see more about bob and doug and make sure that they continue to be okay our next question comes from keith cowie uh before i ask my question just to gwen i got to tell you i can remember sitting in a hotel lobby with you and elon nearly 20 years ago looking at the first drawing so i gotta say this has just got to be too cool for you guys and i think everybody had a bit of a cheer in their eye um i want to do a follow-up on lauren's question about the boats um you know i i took all the safety classes at nasa and nitrogen tech is not something you monkey with i just i'm wondering why it is you dropped the space capsule into a location where power boats are likely going to be i mean it was a guy in a sailboard another guy with a big trump flag mere feet away and nobody seemed to be trying to shoo them off um are you going to sort of maybe try to not be that close to shore next time i think we're going to look at a number of different options but you're absolutely right we can do better uh certainly um we had all the clearance that was required at landing and then as soon as as soon as that i mean that that capsule was in the water for a good period of time and you know the boats just made a beeline for it so um it's it's a big area to have to clear and to to clear all of it is probably going to require more resources but it's uh yeah there are things that we're going to look at that we can do better next time for sure everybody understands that the crews that we had deployed there their focus was to make sure bob and doug got on the boat and exited the capsule safely it was not really their job to police the area we had the coast guard out there for that the lesson learned here is we probably need more coast guard assets maybe some more spacex and nasa assets as well what's important is that bob and doug got safely on the boat we were able to keep the area clear for landing and then ask people to move back as they came a little bit too close to the dragon capsule which they did so anyhow this was a demonstration mission this is the time that you go learn about these things and we'll certainly be better prepared next time thank you our next question will come from irene klotz thanks katina and congratulations everyone it was very impressive to watch today the iss crews of course spacex plans to fly paying passengers um after going through this demo one mission do you still think that you're going to be ready mature enough the system for a paying passenger as early as one or two more flights you cut out a little bit thanks for the question yeah this uh this mission was incredibly smooth uh not to say that there weren't things that we want to work on and do better next time but uh the capsule worked beautifully uh the the the operations worked extremely well so we certainly feel comfortable that we're on the right path to carry commercial passengers not too long from now obviously our focus is ensuring that we get crew one lifted off in time to do a handoff with crew 2 but yeah i think i think based on the results that we've seen so far there's more data obviously to go look at but based on the results so far i'm very comfortable okay we're going to ask get a quick question from twitter we have bulgari asked how long will it take astronauts to normalize after you leave the capsule how much to return to normal life on earth and if steve you want to take that sure uh bettina i can certainly take that um you know it really it really depends uh bob and doug were in space for uh for a couple of months and so they'll come back here and they'll start uh doing some special training so you know sometimes within a matter of a few days or weeks they're they're kind of back back to normal so it varies a little bit from crew to crew but we'll get them back here and they'll start doing uh some special exercises and special things to get them re-adapted to earth's gravity so far they look like they're doing really well um and uh so uh we're looking forward to getting them back here in houston we'll take our next question from joey roulette doing this um question for gwen um based on the results so far how many missions do you foresee before you guys start flying private cruise and also since we're uh planning to reuse crew 2 our reuse capsule for crew 2. um i was just wondering if you could break down the refurbishment process for this and and how i guess nasa came to agree to reusing these capsules after they splash down it and for jim and steve stitch i'd love to hear uh your take on that as well um what kind of happened to to make this crew capsule reusable for humans thanks so much hey joey so appreciate the question um obviously we're trying to really change the paradigm of human spaceflight and in order to do that you need to make sure that these capsules are rapidly and readily reusable we've been working on this with our launch customers and with nasa for probably half a decade or so the dragon 2 vehicle itself was designed with far greater certainty on ensuring it can be reused the capsule is designed for five to ten missions we have to see how things worked out after we examine the capsule when it gets back to port and back to the cape to our facilities there but based on the telemetry and any visual indications that we've had so far the vehicle looks like it's in really good shape i'll let steve and and jim talk a little bit about the journey on getting reusability but it was it was a part of our original bid for uh the commercial crew program as gwen said it was part of their original bid uh and you know the vehicle is designed as gwen said for five to ten flights we took a look at that data and we're continuing to look through that and for us it looked like it was a reasonable thing to go do i think part of the question was how long does it take to refurbish the vehicle uh it takes about four months or so so we have a lot of margin getting into the the flight in the springtime flame for crew two uh the vehicle will start actually getting as soon as it gets back to area 59 at the cape it'll start going through its maintenance and we'll mass is a part of that maintenance we have a presence over in area 59 and we'll follow along with every step of that maintenance and also look re-look at all the certification just to make sure that there's nothing untoward and we'll do that as we get uh the build-up to this crew one launch here in the fall we really want to make sure we have overlap between crew one and crew two to ensure that we have access to iss and we're doing that with joel and the isis program yeah i think i think that sums it up you know our desire as an agency has been for sustainability and that means reusability um not in every case but in most cases and uh spacex has proven that they're capable of doing that so we're looking forward to uh to doing crew 2 with the capsule that just came home uh as steve said there's a lot of work to be done between now and then um and a lot of evaluation that needs to be done but uh as gwen said based on the telemetry and what we see it looks like uh we're gonna be in pretty good shape great our next question comes from marsha dunn well please i'm wondering if you know once the deorbit burn had had occurred was there was it pretty tense inside flight control there at spacex and you were sitting right next to elon musk and uh what was it like for him and for you during those final minutes of the flight and especially right after a successful splashdown could you describe those moments please thank you so there's no question it was an enormous relief after months of anxiety making sure we could bring bob and doug back home safely but splashdown was really just the beginning we wanted to make sure that bob and doug exited the vehicle safely and looked good so a lot of people were cheering after splashdown i got a lot of congratulations on my on my uh on my cell phone and emails but we weren't done until we got bob and doug out of the capsule we being kind of elon and i he hopped on a flight he's going to go to houston and meet up with the astronauts and i still have a crew here in mission control making sure that bob and doug got safely on the helicopter and will get safely back to shore so not everybody's job is done yet but it was an initial relief for sure it was a greater relief when i saw bob and doug come out of the capsule smiling thumbs up looking very cheerful that was that was the good moment thank you so much our next question comes from eric berger yeah hi thanks for doing this a question for gwen um it's been 12 years actually to the day when the falcon 1 failed on its third flight that's 12 years you know since then you've launched three different rockets a couple of spacecraft and now put two people into space and brought them back you know 12 years is not that long of a period of time can you process some of sort of the transformation of spacex's has happened during this time frame you know eric 12 years seems like a really long time to me um candidly it is hard to process um i didn't know that today was the anniversary of the third falcon one flight but uh you would know that so thank you for reminding me of that um you know i never shy away from our failures they're incredible opportunities to learn and this company has learned a lot but i have to say that we would not be the company that we are today we would have not achieved this goal without the support that basically the kind of the moral support the financial support as well as the technical support that nasa has given us over the years i think in august of 2006 is when we started working very closely with nasa so though it seems like a long time we have done a lot in that time frame and you know what's so great is we've done so much of this in partnership kind of hand in hand with nasa so you know it's a great day to celebrate uh not only bob and doug's return and they're being the heroes that they are but also to celebrate the relate this extraordinary relationship that we have with nasa and it's been a great relationship we're going to ask some questions from social media we have a question from arturo valdez asks for the crew one team how will data collected alter training for you so close to launch date and how does that impact what you do on the iss that's a great question and thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you all the data collected is going to to help us to move forward to to our launch date but again we've got to refurbish this vehicle and get it ready for crew 2 so that we can have some time to hand over uh and so uh we are ready we're ready to go to the space station we're very close to ready to fly the dragon into low earth orbit and uh but it's also important that we take some time to enjoy the accomplishment celebrating with bob and doug's families and the nasa and spacex team and uh just to to be in the moment and appreciate all the amazing things that have happened here uh it's just a great time to be at nasa and joel anything else about how the information we learned from dm2 impacts future missions at the iss so good question you know we took the opportunity to do some habitability studies while the vehicle was attached to iss so this vehicle as everyone knows only came up with two crew members we'll have four crew members up there for the next vehicle and so we did some testing on that and learned a few things we learned testing on where to stow items and how to live in that vehicle so just a number of items we took a lot of um we took advantage of having the vehicle there for 60 days and that'll help us make a better vehicle in the sense of better operations for crew one and in crew 2 and subsequent vehicles thank you joel we'll go back to our reporters in the queue we'll go next to stephen clark hi thank you for taking my question stephen clark from space flight now a question for gwen uh since you're going to be reusing uh more and more of these crew dragon vehicles i'm curious do you plan on building a fleet of vehicles going forward how many do you think you'll need to have in your rotation for the demand both from nasa and from private uh astronauts private passengers going forward and the question for suicide flight i think you're going to be the first astronaut since john young if i recall correctly to fly on three different launch vehicles with your experience on soyuz and the space shuttle curious if you could compare your experiences on those two vehicles writing them into orbit and how you think falcon 9 may compare going into it thanks okay i go first uh thanks for the great questions uh yes i am very honored to fly this mission and uh along with my experience with the space shuttle and the russian soyuz but the important thing is that i'm rookie to the spacex and i'm learning a lot from from my commander and my pilot they've been in this training floor for a long long time i just started like last february so this is like going back to square one uh is for my safety our team safety so uh every day is like a rookie and the important thing is that we have a great uh variety or diversity in this crew and my my small contribution to this great team is experience so uh but we have a different uh views different backgrounds so name it so the diversity bring up the resilience to this crew so should be a great mission thank you i think his other question was for gwen right thanks bettina steven we are building out a fleet of dragon twos both cargo version and crew version we want to wait and see how many we have to build before we before we say we're done building out the fleet we want to see how this vehicle looks after we get the opportunity to inspect it and such but we do anticipate building out the fleet thank you we're going to go back to the lines and next is jackie goddard goddard for the times of london and congratulations everyone my question is for the crew one folks mike shannon victor soichi i wondered if you could describe um how you watched um that splashdown what you went through emotionally um as you watched it and what it means to you knowing that your flight depended on the success of this one thank you [Applause] well thank you for the question we were together in the control center here in houston watching the splashdown and it was so exciting and i would say i think it's fair to say it was a very emotional event for all of us to be able to watch our colleagues our friends come home safely is always an emotional event and then just to see how smoothly everything went during their splashdown and their re-entry so we're very excited that it went as smoothly as it did because now that really points to the success of how our mission will be when we get a chance to launch thank you shannon we're going to go to dave mosher business insider thank you for taking my question uh gwen this one's for you so this is uh spacex's first flight of people obviously and you have tons of data to go through but i'm i'm really curious what was the most surprising thing your team has learned from the mission so far and relatedly is there any one thing you fix for or change for crew one for you know these guys are on the call you know i don't i have such an extraordinary team here at spacex i don't want to i don't want to undermine any of that but i think probably the greatest surprise is that this mission was as smooth as it is and like i don't want to take anything away from from the team uh but this was a demonstration mission um this wasn't the first flight of dragon 2 but uh uh this vehicle had a lot uh had a lot of capability on it that was not flown uh during the the demo demo one so i think we're surprised minorly surprised but obviously incredibly pleased that that this went as smoothly as it did and there's no question that we learned some things along the way that we will want to roll into the crew one flight some we knew about preflight and i think we had a lot of press on the solar arrays we're looking to have upgrades there to make sure that it the vehicle survives with margin on orbit for the six-month requirement by the way the solar rays on this particular mission did uh as uh better than we anticipated and we certainly would have been able to complete the mission uh the original uh planned mission duration we had a couple months a couple months of margin to spare there um so so pre-flight we learned some things we'll make sure we include those in in crew one as far as things we learned uh real time uh today i think we uh want instead of two generators like a primary and a backup on the uh rescue boat or on the recovery boat i think we'll probably have three generators which is one primary and two backups uh that's just uh one example kind of a small thing that we'll want to do going forward next we have andrea leffenzer and forgive me i've killed that from the houston chronicle thanks for having us um and it was really great watching we can't wait to have him back in houston so i'd like to know how landing compared to the apollo capsules you know was there new technology to kind of make it smoother on the astronauts or was it pretty similar thank you i can take a crack at this one so uh wasn't around during apollo but i would say the landing compared to the apollo spacecraft was was very similar it just turns out the parachute technology and landing a vehicle in the water requires very similar kinds of shoots for the the drugs which deploy up high to stabilize the vehicle and then the main parachutes are are very similar the one difference you know spacex has chosen to use four main parachutes versus apollo had three uh but all in all i would say that the the technology is very similar uh the vehicle itself compared to apollo you compare this dragon what an incredible spacecraft uh very much automated spacecraft uh the crew from the time from the deorbit burn all the way to uh to splash down and landing it doesn't really have to take very many actions on their own the vehicle does that all by itself it's very autonomous and so all in all you know it's a very similar kind of landing we're going to go next to jeff faust of space news good afternoon and congratulations to everybody a question probably for steve stitch you talked about this a little bit earlier but maybe a little bit more details and what's involved with going over the demo 2 spacecraft now that it's back and the process that will lead up to certification so you can launch the crew one mission thanks absolutely happy to talk about that you know we'll do a few things to get ready for certification in a few different areas one we'll review all the telemetry all the data from the dragon we've done that for the whole flight to date we'll do it now for undocking all the way through splashdown and recovery so we'll have engineers we're gonna we do it jointly with spacex we have our nasa team and spacex team work together and go through all the data for each of the various systems life support propulsion and so forth so we'll go through all that data to make sure there's nothing that is anomalous there secondly we'll look at the parachutes the parachutes is a very important system on the vehicle uh spacex was doing a great job of recovering those shoots today so we'll take those back and analyze those and look at it and just to see that they're performing well and then thirdly uh spacex is going to take the vehicle apart one of the benefits of reuse i would say is the fact that we'll take some of the vehicle apart some of the the nose gun will come off the heat shield comes off we'll start to inspect part of the spacecraft and sometimes we can learn things from that and so we'll do that inspection and then we'll put all that data together and head into the certification review uh probably toward the end of this month or early next month we're going to go to michael sheets from cnbc hi all uh great to talk to you and congratulations to everyone especially bob and doug i wanted to note that both of the astronauts were helped out of the cast capsule and i one i was wondering if that's the protocol nasa and spacex have in place or will future astronauts be comfortable enough to be able to step out and walk out themselves thanks take that question um it's pretty typical for the long duration space flight uh when a crew returns to earth that they need a little bit of assistance coming out of the capsule if you just think about the human body when it's been in space bob and doug were in space for for about 63 days so when it comes back into earth's gravity the body does a wonderful job adapting to zero g um and it can you can live and work very well in space but then when you come back in the atmosphere they pulled about four times the force of gravity today coming back and then the gravity is tugging on them a little bit when they come back and so it takes the body a little while to adapt and it takes the inner ear a little bit of time to to adapt to the gravity again and so that's kind of what you see with bob and doug today and it's very typical and so i would expect that for many of our missions that are going to be in these long-duration missions with about a six-month duration thank you we're going to go to marcia smith from space policy online this is my question which is to joel i'm curious about what this is going to mean operationally for the space station to have four people permanently aboard the u.s segment are you going to need more resupply flights uh you talked about how there'll be more signs done so you'll need more signs going up and coming back just what does it mean to have four people up there instead of three on a per minute basis so we're planning to have you know four to five cargo missions resupply missions to the international space station the beauty of having the fourth crew is that person's time is going to be 100 percent dedicated to utilization research and technology development and so today we average about 35 hours a week in that area and we're going to increase that to 70 hours a week once we get four crew members up so that fourth person won't be dedicated to that but the time that he brings to the team that time will be dedicated to that so we're looking forward to it that's something we've been planning for a while we've had some opportunities to do for usos crews as you're well aware in the past and we've had taken that time to learn and plan forward so these the upcoming spacex missions and the upcoming boeing missions we're excited and we're ready to rock and roll rock and roll our next question comes from mike wahl space.com thank you all for doing this um yeah this is another one for the um crew one astronauts i'm just curious but like what kind of conversation do you guys want to have with with yeah both both like bob and doug maybe what's like what do you want to ask them about how yeah how endeavor handled um or how it flew what what do you most want to talk to them about yeah that's a great question uh we did have an opportunity after they got on orbit and docked to the station to talk to them about the launch and that was uh actually very timely because uh we're able to do it when it was all still fresh in their mind and they talked about the various stages of the launch and and what it felt like and even actually um some of the points on the pad when they were sitting there and they were fueling the rocket and and some of the feelings they had there um and so certainly uh that was good and it was great to be able to talk to him that quickly and hopefully we'll have an opportunity to do that again here in their post landing again trying to talk to them while uh while it's still fresh in their minds and of course we'd like to hear all about uh what entry was like um you know the feelings how much the g's came on uh when the shoots open that's usually a very dynamic uh time during the flights and and so just curious what that experience was like and then of course as you can imagine we're all very curious about what it's like to splash down on the water and and then what it's like afterwards uh we're we're hoping we've already put in our request for a day like today when it's our turn to land because uh the water looked very smooth and and it was beautiful so we're hoping that we'll get the same thing yeah that water did look like glass um next we'll go to emery kelly from florida's day hey folks thanks for thanks for doing this and and congratulations i just wanted to possibly get gwen's thoughts um and maybe more just a reaction if you will that this spacecraft that arrived today uh you know bob trusted it for his mission and bob will again trust it for his wife's mission which is you know pretty impressive i'm wondering if you could just talk about that a little bit yeah so um i'd like to point out that uh you know megan is uh first and foremost an astronaut uh when it comes to our perspective uh i'm sure her and bob and excuse me her and bob have a a different uh perspective but she was selected to be one of the esteemed members of the crew 2 mission we will make sure that that vehicle is as good or better than the vehicle that that bob flew in today uh well two months ago and today um so uh yeah this is space flight is really hard um and though the mission was incredibly smooth today especially was very smooth this is still really hard and i just want to make sure everybody understands that that we still have a lot of work to do we will learn every mission that we have um but first and foremost our job is to make sure that the astronauts remain safe both both uphill and downhill so uh what we did for bob i think we can do an even better job for megan and i hope she is really excited to fly in this particular capsule i was really excited to have her named the pilot for the crew 2 mission our next question comes from samantha masonaga from l.a times hi uh thanks for taking my question um i wanted to see if um maybe this is for um gwen or steve to talk a little bit more about the nto fumes that were detected outside the capsule i know steve you're saying they're in limits but anything that you guys are looking at or you know anything that might need to be changed before the next flight yeah i can start and then gwen can add you know we uh it's a it's a pretty common practice with any spacecraft we did it with a space shuttle after landing we would go around and and kind of sniff thrusters to see if there was any uh vapors from those thrusters we did that today with dragon and we did have a slight slight hit on the sensor for the oxidizer nitrogen tetroxide we think there may be some mechanism where it's getting entrapped into the service section kind of from thruster firings during entry we've got to go look through the data this is maybe a little bit of speculation on my part i think we'll go figure out a way to handle it better on the next flight perhaps starting with a purge as soon as we get on the vehicle uh and uh it just it's kind of a normal thing we've had similar things with other vehicles so i wouldn't i wouldn't say this was a big deal at all it was something that the spacex team took extra precaution with just to make sure that their personnel on the ship were safe and then also bob and doug so we'll go look at the data and see if there's anything we can do better next flight one of the things that i would say about this nasa and spacex team and we will get you know hundreds of comments and hundreds of things to look at and post flight even though the flight goes so well uh one of the things that we do in space flight is we just pour over the data and try to learn from it to try to make it better because as gwen said spaceflight is very hard and it can be unforgiving and so you try to look at very you know minute changes in data and things that you see in the data from the flight learn from that and try to do better yeah we made sure that based on all the telemetry that we had that we didn't find any system breaches we had them sniff the thrusters and as steve mentioned we did initiate a uh service section purge i think we'll probably do that sooner next time it was also an incredibly calm day there was not a lot of wind blowing uh on the capsule as uh will probably be blowing more in the future but it was a good good lesson for us we took an extremely conservative approach here we certainly could have brought them out of the capsule sooner than we did but we made sure the inside of the dragon that cabin was uh was not experiencing any fumes bob and doug in fact i heard doug say look take your time we want to make sure we're doing the right thing here take the time that you need and they weren't in a particular hurry so uh it was a good lesson learned um we'll probably initiate a purge sooner there probably will be more wind on future missions and we might not see it uh see this in uh in the future but i think we did the right thing um as uh kind of high anxiety driving that it was i really wanted to see bob and doug come out but i think we did the right thing and uh got the levels to nearly indetectable before we uh before we open the hatch i would i would just add that um just modify maybe what steve said he mentioned that it wasn't that big of a deal it's pretty common and all of that is absolutely true what is not common is having passers-by approach the vehicle at close range with nitrogen tetroxide in the atmosphere that's um not something that is good and we need to make sure that we're warning people not to get close to the spacecraft in the future our next question comes from zachary hall from spacexplore.com sure so kind of on that same token it is there's clearly an educational opportunity for the public you know especially with splashdowns in places where there's there hasn't been in 45 years um to stay back you know as i watched the stream i was learning about what was dangerous about it um i'm curious is there sort of a safe viewing distance the public could uh understand and and view from um and and also um kind of on the same idea of inclusivity and involvement in in space uh what's kind of the better way to channel your excitement for these activities i know we're in the middle of a pandemic and like a parade would probably not not be appropriate but is there something that could be done to kind of celebrate the moment and and also involve the public hand safe distance and then maybe i'll let you talk about the public but we're celebrating the moment and we invited everybody to to join us um online and to to share in the moment um in all the different social media platforms spacex did a great job with with the broadcast so i think there's a lot of different ways that we can do it um but certainly uh you know approaching the spacecraft is is not is not among those ways we're going to be wrapping up in a few minutes um but let's take one of our last questions from jackie waddles hey cnn thanks so much for doing this and congratulations um so i was curious if we could get some insight into what's ahead for bob and doug over the next few hours and days are they going to get to go home with their families tonight and how might the pandemic change how their post-splashdown rehabilitation goes i can start off bob and doug already have left left the ship and they have been transported by helicopter to pensacola they will come back here to jsc via aircraft uh later on this evening they'll get some medical evaluations i think i'm not quite sure whether the plan is to stay stay on site for observation or maybe go back to their families uh certainly they a lot of precautions were made to protect for the pandemic everybody on the ship was quarantined on their personal level self-quarantined for a couple weeks they got tested so we went to a lot of precautions to protect bob and doug uh and make sure that you know they're safe from the virus and we're just excited to have them back here in a few hours so last question is from marina corrin congratulations on a successful splashdown this question is for gwen when you said in your opening remarks on this call that this mission experienced some foibles over 62 days on orbit what foibles were you referring to uh actually the foibles that i was referring to were today we had a our backup generator on the go navigator stopped working before before we set sail so next time we're going to have two backup generators we did mobilize another one but it didn't it wasn't going to get to port in time for the vehicle to set sea and make sure it got to bob and doug we had that vehicle flanked with other ships so we were pretty comfortable but that is is one um and then uh the discussion that we were just having on the uh on the oxidizer on the outside of of dragon we will work on that up to make sure that we keep the astronauts and the folks around the capsule safe those are the only two i think we had the mission on orbit was incredibly kind of quiet i can't recall offhand whether there were some anomalies there may have been some small ones but certainly nothing that uh that stands out thank you gwen and with that we'll turn it over to jim bridenstine for some closing remarks well thank you to uh bettina and thank you to everybody who participated in this a big special thanks to uh bob and doug and their families um the entire nasa team and of course the spacex team um for what an amazing day this was a historic day a couple of things it came up earlier somebody asked when um about what size of a fleet do you need and and do you expect to grow it and of course as a private company spacex is looking at what the demand is and i'm going to tell you what our goal is at nasa our goal is to make sure that there is a big demand in the future and i would love to see a fleet of crew dragons servicing not just the international space station but also commercial space stations which is why we're working so hard every day to commercialize our activities in low earth orbit whether it's industrialized biomedicine or advanced materials there's a lot of hope for humanity on earth based on what the microgravity of space can provide so the future is very bright but it's going to require these public-private partnerships which we have now proven can be very very successful i also want to say another question came up about how spacex has you know changed since uh launching you know falcon one so many years ago and even falcon the third launch of falcon one um was a failure let me be clear the reason we had success today is because spacex is so good at adapting and the nasa team is so good about about sharing what the engineering challenges are and ultimately them responding it has been not without you know some pain from time to time but it has been an absolute amazing partnership and it really just culminated in this spectacular event today when nasa comes and we say we want to create high-level requirements we have a payload capacity that we need we have safety requirements that we need and then we allow a private company like spacex to go and innovate and miraculous things happen we launch rockets with nine engines uh we launch rockets where the launch abort capability is integrated into the spacecraft spacecraft propulsion system itself um we we have a you know a pressure vessel inside of a liquid oxygen tank these are things that that nasa never would have done on its own but because we set the high level requirements and then we say to the private company we say prove to us that your engineering is sound through both engineering and testing um and and as as time went on over the years behind us now uh spacex proved and we and we and we of course as an agency had to had to make sure that what they were telling us was accurate and then um and then testing it and i will tell you it has been just a magnificent thing to watch so again congratulations to the spacex team congratulations to the nasa team it's been an amazing partnership there's a lot more to come i want to one other thing before we close out eric berger sent a tweet yesterday and in that tweet he talked about how you know we have been without a human space flight program now for nine years and he said now we've got dragon and we've got starliner and we've got starship and we've got orion and and blue moon and other vehicles that are on the table may it never be that the united states goes a day without a human space flight capability in the future and i would double down on that and say i'm the first nasa administrator in history that was not alive when we had people living and working on the moon we have to make sure that another generation doesn't miss this opportunity today was a great victory but it is just the beginning the artemis program is our sustainable return to the moon we're going to go to the moon and we're going to stay we're going to learn how to live and work there for long periods of time and we're going to take that on to mars so i want to thank eric berger for that tweet and i also want to say that if we do things right we will get the strong bipartisan support that we need to make sure that this program is sustainable into the future and that it grows into the future and i also want to thank the president and the vice president for their amazing support the budget request before the house and the senate right now is 25.2 billion dollars when my name was first floated for the nasa administrator a little over i guess two and a half years ago about now um actually it was longer than that that the budget for nasa was 18 billion so 18 billion to 25.2 billion we've got a bright future a big agenda this is this is an amazing opportunity not just for the united states of america but for the world but i would implore our members of congress bipartisan house in the senate to please fund the budget request for nasa we have proven that if you give us the resources we can deliver and our partners can deliver and this is about all of america so i just want to say thank you to everybody for getting us to where we are and i would implore um the the folks that fund our agency to uh to to to get an appropriation done um that justifies the great work that we've already done so thank you guys so much what an amazing day we made history today congratulations to everybody thank you so much that concludes today's press conference have a great day [Music] foreign
