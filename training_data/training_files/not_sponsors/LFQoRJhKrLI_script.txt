in today's episode we're exploring an abandoned hospital some portions of which are over a hundred years old although the facility began its life as tuberculosis sanatorium it was later converted to a general hospital and then a hospital exclusively for stay prisoners the department of corrections closed the facility in the late 2000s now join us as we venture inside to discover what's left [Music] this video is brought to you by the ridge wallet with their light sleek and industrial design ridge wallet is redesigning the wallet experience it's designed to easily fit in your front pocket with minimal bulge but holds up to 12 cards plus room for cash using either the money clip or the cash strap we've been using these wallets for over a month now and they really are extremely durable hold everything we need and are still a low profile i didn't expect how big of a difference there would be from my old bulky folding wallet to the ridge that's basically half the size the ridge wallet comes with a lifetime warranty so this could very well be the last wallet you ever purchase and if for any reason you don't love it it has a 45 day return policy see how the ridge wallet can change

the main gate [Music] it looks pretty cool already there's beds in these rooms you can tell it was a prison hospital looks a little rough you can see the numbers too strengths on the wall kind of like cell blocks yeah could be numbered i found the chairs just chilling what is this biohazard bags it's infected infection they look unused to title this video exploring abandoned coronavirus hospital honestly we're probably pretty safe from the current virus here more so than being anywhere at the time of filming this video the official tally of coronavirus cases in the country was 15. little did we know how much worse things were about to become heading into a different building now information about patients nice yeah 2006. this one is about a patient though thank you and your daughter lisa for accepting inmate de bruyne onto your family care home schedule for parole 2006 it gets closer to parole date it's a signed case manager will contact to arrange transportation whatever whatever monthly statistics the pharmacy committee medical records committee inmate appointment positions total authorization if you went through every document in this building you'd probably find some bombshells but the name who's got time for that he's a felon he's medically unfit this is from 2008. the kitchen looks pretty big it's gonna smell like ass in there every kitchen does they always smell like sour milk i still have some stoves and fryers some soup things this is where we make the prisons do this is a spiral staircase down really it's locked i love how this reads really bluntly like state law and common decency require that every food handler thoroughly wash his hands after each visit to a toilet for the freezers of course they had to mark everything to make sure nothing's gone missing and a prisoner doesn't have it yeah it's pretty cool there's a freezer back here there's a freezer in the freezer [Music] there's a freezer in the freezer in the freezer oh my god how far is this going i've never this reminds me of the morgue that we did yeah it just looked like this but with tables or bodies in it strange how they have them inside each other this door likes to close on itself yeah we're deep in here let's not get locked in i don't even think it can latch anymore it looks kind of broken i see some gritty stairs really yeah we've got some more decay going on in here medical records looks pretty empty in here maybe they actually did what they were supposed to do at least partially there's an old vending machine nope there's already patient records right here from 2010. this says this was the control operation center off limits do you see any buttons that would like unlock doors and [ __ ] it's probably a surveillance system somewhere in here there's a lot of tchotchkes around in here wow this room is really decaying probably just the window busted open looks like it's empty looks old though there's a full-on doc suit like yellow jumpsuit here blood bank this was an accredited blood bank until 1975 at least looks like some classic asbestos tile in there yeah this area is looking a lot more interesting this is probably an older section yeah these definitely look like those asbestos tiles the size in the pattern of them they say nine by nine is what they made them in this looks about nine by nine this looks like a center of a hospital wing down this way yeah this is the center of the ward i guess sort of a hospital table for the go over the bed wow look at this room holy bible so set up yeah this is not even a patient room this is like a storage room definitely a setup chart review destruction record controlled substance record yeah i don't think this was a recovery room or anything nope [ __ ] dangerous on the bed it's so cheesy this is i bet someone hung this up here too oh yeah of course they found all these things separate things probably that's a defibrillator i think it looks like an old one though crt it's a paper [Music] chart [Music] this swing looks like it has more stuff in it but this swing is smaller so maybe we should just get this one done with first before heading to that one cleaning room these rooms are pretty intact over here there's a lot of furniture and beds in them these look pretty natural decay not set up so they would have had two beds per room and then one bathroom is shared between four people it's an old looking nightstand these rooms are a little larger there's x-ray viewers here he's got wheelchairs just chilling and this connects over to another ward so this is yet another one each one has their own name in the center this is broadfoot one damn look at this elevator door is going to open no way it's actually kind of ornate in here it's like carved wooden dowels back to the green and black tile now this looks like a prison cell toilet sink water fountain toilet combo unit yup definitely prison [Music] oh you could see where the bars were on all the windows yeah was it just this room no they all some of the rooms did yeah this room has nothing but those holes where the this paint the old paint you can see behind where the bars were this is probably a higher security room and look at this a pass-through for giving food and stuff yeah this is definitely more like a prison cell in a hospital room it's very foggy out still this looks like a cool room look at the light fixtures that is very 50s there's all these wheelchairs there's only one of these left all these wheelchairs have holes for toilet pans it's still foggy as hell out it's creepy [Music] this hallway has a lot of decay going on wow it's cause people leave windows open [Music] [Music] [Music] these are big rooms probably had like one two three four five six people in a room here rolls pretty nice [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] see what's on the bottom floor of this building oh man it smells dank down here this might be entirely maintenance utility stuff down here it's like a tunnel out here fog is definitely the best weather for exploring this is where the ambulances would pull up probably does say emergency there's freaking bamboo growing all around here seems a little out of place it is so foggy you can see the two different areas of building right here the one on the left is much older puppy is assisting this site out that door is just a jungle of bamboo really straight ahead oh yeah look at this cell so this was the emergency this right here was the emergency place where they brought the ambulances in and i think they just moved people into these holding cells when they first arrived here they are these are the puppies assisting with sight right here look at this guy he's doing his job this cabinet is filled with files oh look check this out emergency response progress note 2006 this is full information on someone who was brought in by ambulance there really is a whole bamboo forest out here i feel like i'm in kyoto or something this looks like it was a doctor's lab or office area x-ray viewers it says x-rays sexual assault evidence collection kit oh yeah and a catheterization tray fun stuff this is a biohazard container it's a biohazard container with some red stuff on it says sharp objects i don't know it looks like they are in there actually this is just a container filled with used needles sitting here okay let's set up two flights because we're already on this floor of this [Music] building this is a pretty nice hospital so far it's a lot of stuff left in here weird out this bed get here in the center of the hallway at this appealing angle there by itself this is such a great day to explore this place oh wow this is a cooler yeah this is a very classic abandoned hospital scene with the curtains the pastel blue the crusty ceiling the eye chart's kind of unique too looks pretty old [Music] coming up in part two we'll discover some of the most interesting areas of the hospital yet including surgical rooms a chapel
