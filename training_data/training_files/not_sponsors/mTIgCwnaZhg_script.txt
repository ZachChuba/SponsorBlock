hey there everybody it's adam here from tesla australia welcome back to another video well today again is software update day so this morning i received a notification on my card telling me that there was a software update available actually it look at that if you haven't already uh but yeah today a new update uh just a relatively minor update so i have received 2020.24.6.9 so that is a slight update from uh 2020.24.6.4 that i was running before uh the release notes well they don't really show anything new so if we have a look at the release notes very briefly on the screen i'm not going to go through them in a lot of detail just because i did cover them in my previous update video which i will put in a link in the card above uh so it's just your standard kind of release notes uh from that release so assuming this is just mainly bug fixes so i thought i would uh do a bit of a autopilot test on my normal circuit that i normally do when i get these updates uh there will be a couple of things that i'll be looking out for that i will uh i'll talk about when we get onto the motorway to start doing that testing so so far nothing overly new uh but uh we'll uh see if we can spot any uh any improvements in terms of the way autopilot handles the drive so stay tuned on this drive all right so we are uh just a few kilometers away from the freeway entrance uh but just before i uh comments that i've had on all of my videos today all right here we are entering the m1 motorway right now so we're going to look and see whether this merge happens which it did okay however it didn't uh didn't indicate correctly uh or at all actually uh so that wasn't great that improvement hasn't uh hasn't changed at all uh since the last time i tested this route as well it just decided to uh to just move on to the freeway now i've got some people here trying to merge that really don't have too much of an idea emerging onto a freeway at 60 kilometers an hour which isn't great so i'm gonna actually merge over myself the car actually chose to do it at the same time but this is 110 kilometers an hour now and unfortunately you are on your brakes like nothing else which uh isn't overly safe uh so that wasn't great uh but the car now moving over into the slowest lane which is a good sign uh this is something that i think the car should do more which it doesn't normally decide to do it normally likes to hang in the middle lane uh but i would much prefer the car to sit uh in the left lane if it's if it's not overtaking uh and to be clear i don't i don't mean undertaking i mean uh just hanging in this lane if the if the car is uh happy doing so and it's not actually overtaking so so that was a good sign uh we've got about 11 kilometers to or take kind of my normal exit and as always i'll uh i'll speed up the footage just so you're not sitting there watching me drive as well and i will jump in when there is something of importance to talk about let's get some sun baby all we need to put on is [Applause] all right we are now two kilometers away from my normal exit uh it'll be interesting to see where the car will decide to move over whether it will try and get in front of the truck or whether it's just going to happily uh moving behind it it always makes me a little bit nervous in situations like this it's probably too far out to beat the the truck cars indicating now it is looking like it's going to move over which is a good thing i would uh be a bit nervous if the car decided to to jump in front of that truck but that's a that's a good decision by the car in this instance so all clear we will follow this truck for another 500 meters or so we're gonna look here and just see what the overall rate of the exit is in many instances i find the car really should slow down a little bit more before it actually tries to take the exit rather than trying to hit it at the 410 and uh generally it tries to take it kind of quite rough which it was actually pretty good that time it wasn't too bad at all uh the cars indicating that navigate on autopilot will end normally the car takes the left lane here which it's a bit unsure of oh no it's actually taken the right lane this time so that's a bit of an improvement as well so i'm gonna turn off uh the navigate on autopilot here and i'm gonna navigate home so i'll cut back when i am about to enter the freeway to head northbound all right here we go navigate on autopilot is going on and yep this that bug with the indicating to the left is still there so that is not good uh not overly terrible though i can just i can just disengage it as i need to uh nice entrance to the freeway that is all good a couple of trucks that i'm following which i'll happily hang back away from i might just actually drop my follow distance back to three just because they're renowned and they are right now throwing back a lot of rocks that i can i can actually hear hitting the car which isn't great i'm gonna actually i'm actually gonna pause that and just hang back even further because it isn't great for the car or my windscreen when i can hear them flicking rocks up like that so i'm gonna just hang back here i'm actually going to drop autopilot down to 100 and i'm going to just sit here just to be on the safer side i do have to exit in about three kilometers anyway so it's not a terrible thing there's no need for me to have to rush things and i'd have to move around two lanes to to get in front of these trucks so i'm quite happy just hanging here in the in the left lane until i get to my exit [Applause] all right so we're about 900 meters away from the exit now and again the car normally takes this exit just fine uh generally like i said just before going southbound uh the car does take it generally a little bit on the on the rough side uh so it'll be interesting to see what happens here whether we see that overall smoothed out a little bit in this release so let's see how we go here yeah that's still a little bit rough it's probably a little bit nicer heading southbound um but overall it wasn't bad it was it was pretty acceptable so pretty good overall nothing majorly different from what i can see in this release um autopilot worked pretty much as expected uh like i said i can't say that there was anything too major that i saw different uh either good or bad really i'm quite happy with overall how the car performed in that test so just a relatively quick video today taking you through 2020.24 dot i'm hoping in the next few days or so we might get an update to 2020.28 uh that would be pretty cool the rumor is as that version does include the ability to pass through green lights following another car without confirmation uh so that would be really cool to get that so as soon as i see that drop and i get it installed i'll be sure to head out and do some testing of that for you as well to show you that new new version so as always again thank with you then bye for we can now
