17th and on your screen is a live view of falcon 9 as it awaits its 1209 pm eastern time launch from cape canaveral space force station in florida my name is yo mazo and i'm a propulsion engineer here at spacex welcome to our webcast coverage for gps3 space vehicle 5 for the space force spacex's 19th launch this year gps originally developed by the u.s air force and formerly known as the global positioning system is a constellation of orbiting satellites that provide precise position navigation and timing data to military and civilian users globally the u.s space force continues to provide this free service to more than 4 billion users worldwide for many of today's viewers gps services aren't new if you're like me and have ever used your phone's mapping service or retrieved coordinates for a location via a pin drop then you've received information from a satellite within this system collectively with the system's already operational satellites the payload today will further the us space force's ability to provide mission-critical global access persistence and awareness for our national security before we dive deeper into learning more about the gps satellite and its capabilities let's take a closer look at the vehicle on your screen falcon 9 our two-stage liquid field launch vehicle is in position at space launch complex 40. now while the booster supporting today's mission is flying for the second time today marks the first time that spacex is supporting a u.s space force mission with a reused booster and to top it off this particular booster debuted right here on slick 40 for last year's gps3 space vehicle 4 mission now if you're new to our webcast or unfamiliar with the falcon 9 what you see at the bottom two thirds of the vehicle are soot markings from its previous flight these markings are located on what we call the first stage the first stage's primary role with the help of its nine merlin engines is to accelerate the vehicle all the way to the edge of space where it will then drop off the second stage carrying the payload following its drop-off of the second stage the first stage will make its way back to earth where we'll attempt to recover it on our autonomous drone ship just read the instructions which you can see there now if you turn your attention to the section above the first stage and the black carbon fiber interstage you'll see the falcon 9 second stage about two and a half minutes into flight the first and second stage will separate and the second stage will ignite its single mvac engine to carry the gps satellite to a highly elliptical orbit separation from second stage will then occur and then the satellite will perform burns finally above this stage placed at the very top of the vehicle you'll see this nose cone structure called a fairing inside that structure is where the gps3 satellite is currently sitting the two fairing halves are safely encapsulating satellite to provide it to protect it from aerodynamic heating loads and contamination during ascent the fairing house we are using today are new and we'll recover them using our chartered recovery ship hos briarwood once the fairing reaches the vacuum of space we will jettison the fairing house as the second stage continues on its journey to orbit good morning from spacex headquarters in hawthorne california i'm john inspector falcon principal integration engineer the launch vehicle and satellite vehicle teams are ready for launch as we approach t minus 10 minutes 45 seconds to lift off this is our fourth gps launch and all four have been from space launch complex 40. earlier today the satellite team performed functional checkouts of the gps satellite and the satellite went on internal battery power at t-minus 15 minutes the falcon 9 team began their final checks at t minus 2 hours and most recently we completed the poll to proceed with propellant load and launch this was at t minus 38 minutes and all parties were go the team at cape canaveral began loading propellant on time at t-minus 35 minutes falcon 9 is a bi-propellant vehicle that means it uses two propellants a fuel and an oxidizer for falcon 9 our fuel is a refined form of kerosene known as rp1 now to burn the fuel we need an oxidizer most burning on earth uses oxygen which makes up about 21 percent of the air you breathe however in space there's no atmosphere to provide oxygen or other oxygen bearing molecules so the rocket needs to carry its own oxidizer to space in our case our oxidizer is super chill liquid oxygen referred to as densified logs liquid oxygen is chilled well below its boiling point and that increases its density which allows us to load more into the first and second stage box tanks now currently fuel loading is complete on the second stage fuel loading is continuing on the first stage for another few minutes and we'll wrap up at t minus six minutes the liquid oxygen loading is continuing on both the first and second stages and you can see the gaseous vapor coming off of both tanks is that ultracoal liquid oxygen contacts the skin of the vehicles and the florida air now in addition to its propellants falcon9 also needs an ignition source to start burning the fuel and oxidizer and for that we use the chemical t-tub that stands for tri-ethyl aluminum and tri-ethyl borane now when it's fully filled falcon 9 first and second stages combine to carry over 1.1 million pounds of propellant and we're gonna burn through most of that over the eight and a half minutes it takes to land the first stage and get the second stage into its initial orbit now once our merlin engines begin to burn rp1 kerosene and liquid oxygen you're going to see the rocket throwing that combustion exhaust out of the engine nozzles in one direction and that results in a push on the rocket in the opposite direction and this is a great example of newton's third law of motion for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction on the weather front at t minus one hour we were down to just 10 probability of violating launch weather requirements the only thing we've been looking at is upper altitude wind shear that looks good right now so we expect we're gonna be good for the last seven and a half minutes of the countdown weather conditions are also looking good for the booster landing on our drone ship and for the fairing recovery so with that the launch vehicle satellite the weather the range are all good to go for a 1209 pm eastern liftoff from space launch complex 40. as we mentioned earlier today's gps3 space vehicle 5 mission is for the u.s space force this mission will be spacex's fourth overall gps3 mission two missions were successfully launched in 2020 and one in 2018 and following today's launch we are planning our fifth mission for sometime next year to date these next generation satellites provide increased signal accuracy and reliability to operate even if confronted by cyber adversaries not only does gps3 help with national security it also enables all facets of our daily lives to learn more about the constellation take a look at this video by the space and missile system center which provides critical national security space capabilities to the u.s space force [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] stage one rp1 load closed out [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] retract [Music] it is t minus four minutes 35 seconds everything continues to be go for launch you've had a quiet countdown throughout the morning now on your screen you see the large structure next to falcon 9 that's the strong back at any moment the strong back will begin opening the two clamps around the second stage you can kind of see them obscured a little bit with the lots vapor the strongback retract sequence has begun now once the clamp arms are open the strongback will retract away from the rocket slightly just under two degrees and then as the falcon 9 lifts off the hydraulic arms will pull the strong back farther away get a little bit of a view as the arms come open next step now is the strongback will begin to recline away from the falcon 9. there's not much motion but you can see we're getting a little bit of gap opened up between the strongback and the falcon 9. now the strongback is part of the transport erector that's called the te the transport erector is used to roll out falcon 9 to the launch pad raises it to the vertical launch position also routes power fluids and communication to both the rocket and the satellite the te includes both the launch mount that the first stage is clamped to right now and the strong vac which is hinged to the launch mount next major event coming up with t-minus three minutes is close out of liquid oxygen loading on the first stage stage one pogo bleed we're closing out liquid oxygen loading on the first stage falcon 9 and gps teams are continuing to track no issues for launch the weather continues to look good the range is ready to support the spacex team is monitoring completion of wax loading on stage two that's due to finish up at about t minus two minutes and as a reminder if we have to call a hold on today's launch we have a backup opportunity tomorrow with a liftoff time of 1205 pm eastern day two lock slowly closed out and we've got confirmation stage two locks loading is complete and that completes loading of the over 1.1 million pounds of repellents on the falcon 9. all systems remain go for launch right now we are beginning to drain the propellant out of the lines that go up the strong back to the second stage that's creating the large white cloud you see around the strongback pressure from that ultra cold wax line is vented overboard and it meets up with the warm moist florida air now our next event will be startup called out at t minus one minute that point the first and second stage computers on factor nine are executing stored programs to prepare the rocket for flight leading to ignition of the merlin engines at t minus two seconds and lift off at t zero falcon 9 is in startup falcon computers are running the final sequence for launch we're also pressurizing first and second stage tanks for liftoff pressure the md is go for launch we've heard the call out the space force mission director is go for launch t-minus 33 seconds and counting all systems go for launch 30 seconds let's listen into terminal count and watch as falcon 9 transports the us space forces gps-3 space vehicle number five satellite into orbit t-minus 15 seconds ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero ignition and lift off go falcon go gps vehicle is pitching downrange stage one chamber pressures are nominal t plus 36 seconds spacex launch engineers report nominal conditions on falcon 9 we begin the trip to space carrying the gps-3 satellite merlin engine is about to throttle down we're in the throttle bucket telemetry decreasing acceleration of preparation for maximum dynamic pressure great views looking aft towards cape canaveral vehicle is supersonic we're throttled back up to full power we're out of the throttle bucket and we're supersonic [Music] now from here on even though velocity is rapidly increasing the atmospheric density is decreasing that's resulting in less loads on the falcon 9 you've heard the call out we're through max q so the loads are now decreasing on the launch vehicle mvac engine chill has started that call out says the bleed valve on second stage engine is open that's beginning a final chill of the mvac engine prior to second stage ignition all's looking good with the stage one trajectory now we've got three events coming up in quick succession we're gonna have main engine cutoff miko as we call it the first and second stages will then separate and then we will have ignition of the second stage engine to propel falcon 9 into the first parking orbit beginning to throttle down the first stage engines to hold 4g constant acceleration coming up on main engine cutoff miko stage separation [Applause] and we've got as you can hear the cheering in the background successful stage separation second stage is now under power of the single merlin vacuum engine you may have noticed some curved pieces uh of metal come off the end of the nozzle right after ignition that's normal these are ground handling tools nominal trajectories they're not needed in flight we hear the call out we're following nominal trajectory with the left side of your screen you can see the first stage grid fence the titanium grid fins have deployed coming up next fairing separation acquisition signal pow monkey bearing separation confirmed a nice view from the second stage camera showing successful fairing deploy as falcon 9 is passing through 110 kilometers altitude now we will be attempting to retrieve these new fairing halves with the help of our contracted recovery vessel hos briarwood now currently falcon 9's second stage heading northeast along the u.s coast we are sending telemetry down to the spacex bermuda ground station vehicles continue to follow nominal as we pass four minutes and 20 seconds into flight all systems are go acquisition signal bermuda as falcon 9 carries gps into space it's t plus four minutes and 45 seconds here into today's mission and we're currently in the first of two plant and back burns for satellite deployment you can see from the live views on your right the second stage mvac engine is burning and there on your left is a live view of the falcon 9 first stage as it's preparing to re-enter the earth's atmosphere at t plus 6 minutes and 18 seconds you should see on your screen the first stage is entry burn this is just in just about a minute this burn will last about 30 seconds and position a signal new hamper for the entry burn we re-light the center e9 engine on the first stage and then part way through we realize the e youth vehicles continue to follow nominal trajectories and e5 engine so we will have a total of three m1d engines helping to slow the vehicle down as it passes back into the earth's atmosphere you can see a great uh live look at that falcon 9 first stage there as it's coasting back down now the falcon 9 supporting today's mission will perform this entry burn for the second time and both fairing halves will re-enter for the first time this booster previously supported the november 2020 gps three mission and we're pretty excited to watch today's landing because it marks the first mission we're supporting for the u.s space force with a flight proven booster now entry burn will start in just a few seconds here lesson for the call out stage one flight termination system is safe stage one energy baron has started you have the call out and you can see on your screen stage one entry burn has started this burn lasts about 30 seconds stage one entry baron shut down we did have a successful stage one entry burn there and now while falcon 9 makes vehicles continue to follow nominal trajectories while falcon 9 makes its way back to earth you may notice that there are different soup marquis soup markings on the outer covering of the rocket you can maybe just see them on your screen on the left there now if you've ever wondered how these markings are formed the set is generated when the carbon-based rocket-grade kerosene or rp-1 burns and since our re-entry occurs engines first the booster flies through its own plume which deposits the soot on the rocket there now coming up next will be our landing burn which will be at t plus eight minutes and seven seconds this will also last about 30 seconds and it will hopefully land our first stage on our drone ship just read the instructions stage one is transonic off the atlantic coast you heard the call out that stage one is now transonic stage two is entered terminal guidance now just one second after the start of the landing burn we will actually have second engine cut off each two flight termination system is safe on the second stage on the right so both coming up in just a few seconds here stage one landing burn has started you can see that stage one entry burn landing burn and sheco one there's the first stage coming in landing legs are deployed parking orbits [Music] [Applause] what a beautiful view of that first stage landing and we did get a confirmation from our second stage of a nominal orbit you can hear the cheering in the background everyone's really excited um we did again have a confirmation of a nominal orbital insertion and of course we saw that beautiful landing of our falcon 9 first stage on our drone ship just to read the instructions and there you have it you've just witnessed falcon 9's 19th landing for this year and spacex's 88th overall successful recovery of a first stage and now at this time our mission isn't over just yet the second stage is now embarking on its first coast phase coasting in this orbit will last about 53 minutes and then we'll re-light that mvac engine for a second time shortly after at t plus one hour and two minutes we'll see you back here signal newfoundland one hour and three minutes

had a nominal mission so far falcon 9 lifted off on time at 1209 pm eastern from cape canaveral space launch complex 40. two and a half minutes later we separated our first and second stages now the second stage completed its first burn placing the falcon 9 and the gps into the desired parking orbit as you can see from the timeline at the bottom of the screen we're approaching the second burn of the mvac engine and that will carry falcon9 and gps to the orbit needed to deploy the satellite now the burns coming up in about 20 seconds apparently falcon 9 second stage we're chilling in the engine getting ready for ignition we're settling propellants and back ignition we've got ignition of the second stage engine iodine nozzle starting to glow red hot as normal now this burn is planned to last 44 seconds and during that time we're going to add two kilometers per second to our velocity you can see the gauge on the bottom right of the screen showing stage two is quickly gaining speed that two kilometers per second will equal out to 7 000 kilometers per hour being added to our velocity this is going to change the orbit from a 400 kilometer apogee to one with a 20 000 kilometer apogee throttling down the engine preparing for shutdown and back shutdown okay we've got shutdown we're waiting to hear from the guidance officer nominal orbit insertion and we've got a nominal orbit insertion now as a reminder the gps satellite is still attached to falcon 9's second stage payload deployment is time to occur once the orbit takes us into range of one of the space force satellite ground stations one in hawaii one in california once we reach this point the falcon 9 flight computer will command release of the gps satellite now currently we're getting data through tasmania so it's going to take us about 25 minutes until the orbit climbs into sight of the ground stations satellite separation will then occur at approximately 2 plus 1 hour and 29 minutes now while we wait for this next milestone i have a short video from the satellite manufacturer lockheed martin it'll highlight some of the new capabilities of the spacecraft take a look and we'll see you back here at 2 plus 1 hour and 28 minutes for satellite separation [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] expect glasses signal tasmania [Music] [Music] so [Music] 25th century [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] welcome back to our launch coverage for the gps3 space vehicle 5 mission for the us space force if you're just joining us we had an on-time launch at 1209 pm eastern followed by a successful ascent stage separation first stage landing and two second stage engine burns we have just one more major milestone coming up to complete today's mission which of course is the deployment of the gps three satellite from falcon 9 second stage which will happen here in just under a minute at t plus one hour 29 minutes and 20 seconds currently we are in view of the customer ground stations at hawaii and california which are necessary to reach prior to deployment now in the 20 or so minutes since we've been coasting we have increased quite a bit in altitude from our last burn from about 420 kilometers now all the way up to over 4 000 kilometers you can see those beautiful live views from our second stage and let's listen in to hear that call out and watch for gps three separation from our second stage here in just a few seconds a load separation confirmed you can see in that beautiful video and heard the confirmation that we did have a successful payload deployment there and for those watching you are witnessing a successful deployment of the gps three space vehicle five and with that successful deployment that now brings our webcast to a close great views from the camera on the second stage of falcon 9 as we watch gps three number five heading away from the vehicle it's on its way to do its mission i'd like to thank you we'd like to thank the u.s space force for entrusting us with today's gps3 space vehicle 5 mission spacex is one of two certified providers for national security space launch missions and we're proud to be able to offer reliable cost-effective launch services to the u.s space force we look forward to supporting the next gps mission that's targeted for liftoff next year also we sent thanks this afternoon to the space forces space launch delta 45 for range support spacex will be observing june 10th this weekend a historic holiday that commemorates the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the united states and we would also like to wish all the dads out there a happy father's day thanks for tuning in and have a great weekend you
