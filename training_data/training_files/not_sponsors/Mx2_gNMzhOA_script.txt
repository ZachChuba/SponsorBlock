hey what is going on you guys it is mr no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today i bring you guys loot from 1000 sinister keys yet again another key in the loot series i think we only have maybe two or three left after this one i will say without a doubt this is the oldest key that you will see in this loot series released into the game december 12 2002 spending 32 mil on 1 000 sinister keys the goal for this video was to see if you can make profit by buying these keys and opening the chest with them or if you're going to be losing money how much money can you lose and is it worth looking into at all especially for normal accounts and even iron man accounts so the sinister key is used to open the sinister chest in yanil agility dungeon the sinister chest as you'll see on screen very shortly contains nine noted grimy herbs two harlanders three renars one irit one evento and one quarm and of course one torstol the gear for this video i mean this was just done on the alternate account it only took three hours to do so it's a very short thing if you're gonna do a thousand keys should take you depending on how quick you run and how much attention you pay just about three hours to do this and that time length will come in handy later on in the video when we get to the price check just to see you know if this is a viable money maker so just using full graceful and having any slash weapon for the web that is outside of this area you will also get poisons so it's up to you if you want to bring an anti-poison but ideally you're going to be banking right after you open up all these keys in this chest so if you have a ornament pool in your house you should be fine you can definitely see that there is a delay when you're opening this chest and although all these clips are fast forwarded to the extreme it still takes a long time to open the chest just as it goes for the animation overall though to do a full inventory uh it doesn't really take too long as it goes for the banking you know just using castle wars bank uh from the poh and then of course a watchtower teleport directly from the poh to there once you're there you just have to run a little northeast and you will see the web right away you can also use nightmare zone teleport and run west or just any teleport to you know and just run right outside the city and you should see it a cool thing about opening these chests is that you'll always get noted herbs from it so you don't actually have to bank the herbs you can just kind of leave them at the bottom of your inventory as you can see 21 keys were brought every single inventory alongside that very useful construction cape teleport so that was my recommendation just to bring 21 i think that's a perfect number it's also a good movie so the sinister key is actually dropped by just a few npcs in the game the main one being solaire and the twisted which you guys will see a future loot video on him and of course the chaos fanatic the other way that you can get a sinister key is just by getting lucky when looting a magpie impling and the value of this sinister key no doubt about it is linked to the value of the herbs contained in this sinister chest when you buy a key and you open the chest selling the grimy herbs according to the wiki currently produces a profit of 1801 gp this is subject to change every single day of course maybe even when this video gets released but uh it is important to note that according to the wiki this is profitable but again we'll see the exact numbers when we get to the price check so none of this was actually tracked on roon light um me and my friend thought that rune light would track this chest just like the laryn's key but apparently it doesn't so it's not really that big of a deal it can all be easily calculated anyway but there is just one specific bank tab and that's that a fun fact about these keys you know i think they were about 36 to 37k a couple months ago and recently they have gone all the way down to 32k it seems like through the years um not hundreds of thousands but definitely tens of thousands of keys have been sold on the grand exchange show it's not exactly the most popular item out there certainly not the most popular key but it still has value and i think as long as it always has those herbs connected to it it'll always remain valuable and here's some fun facts about the keys for you shout out to the wiki with this one uh if you were to clean and make all the herbs received into potions each sinister key would give between 747 and 1300 herblore experience depending on which potions you decide to make so if you have a lot of stackable sinister keys in the bank for any of you iron men out there this can result in a lot of her blur xp no doubt about it sinister keys are a common method for early game iron men to get torstals and this can actually be given to dr jekyll the random event in exchange for stamina potions allowing them to build a rejuvenation pool in their player owned house without having level 77 herblore you might want to double check on that but that's actually a really cool trivia fact that i had no idea about imagine a sinister key saving you a herblore grind on your iron man i mean that's that's definitely news to me the high out value on this key is 48 gp so definitely don't uh hide out them anytime soon the buy limit is 11 thousand so you can buy up to eleven thousand but the daily volume is only four thousand three hundred and eighty five maybe there is more keys that are sold than i uh recognize solar in the twisted the npc that is known for these sinister keys he was released into runescape on the very same day that the sinister key was and i wish i would have made a video about this npc i'll throw him up on screen here if you want to see what he looks like i'm sure most of you are familiar with him a great monster that can only be harmed by strike spells certainly a good monster for iron man accounts to camp so i do look forward to doing a loot video on that i'm sure i'll mention the sinister keys again in that video but i highly doubt we'll ever touch on them ever again after that because again there's just so little things that bring these sinister keys into the game and from solaire in the twisted the sinister key is a 1 in 12.8 drop rate not too sure where the 0.8 gets factored in there but nevertheless that's not too bad just 1 12 kills you can always expect a key and before the release of the farming skill killing solarin for the sinister key was the only way to obtain torstol so thank god the farming skill came into the game so as goes for the requirements to do this activity i mean if you want to use the watchtower teleport to get here quickest you definitely have to do the quest watchtower if you don't want to do that just make sure to redirect your house portal to yanil you can also use fairy ring code ciq uh you know you'll arrive somewhat close to this location but that does require fairy tale part two and to come further than the giant bats when you enter this dungeon you do need an agility level of at least 40. so that is something to keep in mind won't get the greatest agility xp down here in this dungeon but you certainly do need that if you want to be doing these keys and once again the chest can release poison gas when opened so again you can bring an anti-poison certainly not required though also encounter a couple different monsters in here so make sure you are ready uh with a little bit of food if you're lower combat looking on youtube there has been sinister key videos done in the past around 2019 and one of them was actually done by eavescape and the link to his channel and the video will be in the description below make sure to check him out alongside him there was another 1000 sinister keys done by flipping old school and i know for a fact that in both of these videos these guys did make profit and although this was a year ago i'm sure that even since the key has risen in price we'll still be able to make profit because again when the key goes up i'm sure herbs go up as well herbs are used so much in runescape there's always a demand for them and for you runescape 3 players out there i'll also be linking a 1000 sinister keys in runescape 3 video uh actually a lot of profit made on that one so it's it's actually always nice to kind of remind you guys of different money making methods you know these sinister key videos that i mentioned you may be thinking to yourself mr no sleep why are you doing the video if it's already been done so many times before well different channels different subscribers you know certain people don't see videos especially videos that were made a year or even years ago i've noticed that a lot of things just kind of get forgotten about you know we live in a world where time just moves so fast and everything's happening all at once it's nice to kind of take a day and just remind people of different content uh whether it's been done before or not not trying to ramble too much but i really do enjoy watching loot videos whether it's done by me or anybody else i remember back in the old days in 2011 you know what really got me into this series was none other than a friend he was the real first guy that i think who started this whole loot series many many years ago and nowadays there's multiple people doing multiple loot videos and it's just great to see there's so much content in runescape and i think the more that we push these videos out there the more that we show maybe this gives jagex an idea to maybe buff some of these things i mean the thing that we're talking about right now in game ladies and gentlemen it's 18 years old and they've never updated it once so i'm looking forward to the day where maybe some of these loot videos help bring some relevance to certain things in this game and that can only be capitalized on from an updating standpoint so let's hope that that happens i think the only video that i've ever done that actually got an update on was brine rats we got the medium clue scrolls added to that so but one accomplishment that i'm very proud of but either way let's go ahead and get into the price check we are coming to a close here loot from 1 000 sinister keys has been completed it only took three hours it's really not a big deal anyone can do this just make sure you got the agility level and a little bit of a combat level and you'll be good to go a total investment of 32 million and now it is time to see the price check 1 000 irit leafs 2 000 harlanders 1 000 quarms as well as 1 000 of intos one of my favorite herbs personally one thousand torsos looking at almost nine million just from the torstels alone and finally the big dog the top dog three thousand rennar herbs at a price of 20 million the overall price check from all of these herbs does come out to be 34.2 million so in total we made 2.2 mil profit with 1 000 sinister keys now we are going to go to the grand exchange and sell everything just so we know how much exact profit we can say we made in three hours of opening the sinister chest so let's go ahead and sell everything right away no need to take any time with this and once we do collect everything it actually ends up at 33 million that doesn't seem like too much so we definitely have to right click examine the money see just how much past 33 we made and it looks like overall 33.8 million 1.8 mil profit in three hours time so we made 600k an hour opening 1 000 sinister keys if you guys have any questions or comments make sure to leave it in the comment section below i really do appreciate you guys watching the video this was a very quick one so didn't really take a whole lot of effort i will see you guys tomorrow with loot from 100 000 master farmers and after that you guys get a slayer video that i've been working on for a little bit now so until next time guys thank you so much mr nose sleep out
