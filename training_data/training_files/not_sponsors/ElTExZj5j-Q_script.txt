how would you play games on your PC if you couldn't use your hands your first instinct might be to use your feet maybe even with a foot controller like the beacon or the stinky foot board but then what if you couldn't use your feet either in that case you might be tempted to get more creative but fortunately for the many people out there including many gamers who struggle to use a conventional keyboard or mouse there's another option introducing quad joy a mouse you control with your mouth aluminum case check out the link below to learn more [Music] so how do you control a mouse with your mouth well the first step is to actually get this device close enough to your face which quad Joey accomplishes with a clamp and a mounting arm now there are two styles of clamps available and this is the most popular one there's also this like kind of pipe mounting clamp one which can grab on to pretty much anything so it's better for wheelchairs but it's almost three times the price and both of them can connect to the mounting arm in multiple orientations so this one this little bit unscrews and you can put it on any one of these five mounting points and then this one you either put it on sideways and mount it here or here or here or you put it on this way and mount it up here that's what we're gonna be doing then you got your mounting on this thing is heavy-duty a/s like it's sturdy enough to keep the device in place in there like look I'm waving it around and it's not bending but it's also flexible enough that you can tailor it to your exact setup and I'll stay exactly where you want it's also got this really nice articulating end here that again really nice quality you just loosen up configure however you want it tighten it up with just one knob and boom this gives you the precision you need to get the quad joy to your lips please stand by while Linus installs the device [Music] so the mouse itself basically a single joystick so you can probably see the cursor moving it around but with the added ability to respond to your breath so out of the box it's totally plug-and-play with no software required and the basic I don't know I guess you could call them like gestures that it's pre-programmed with or a sick for left click or a puff for right click cool right now there is a learning curve so to get to the same level that I would have with my hands would take tens if not hundreds of hours but the folks at quad joy have done their best to make it as easy as possible first of all there are LED indicators that you can actually see out of your peripheral vision so it's easy to tell for example when you've entered what they call scrolling mode all you've got to do is puff until this indicator turns green and then you can puff and sip in order to scroll up and down a page pretty cool and there's the totally optional quad joy desktop app that lets you take these default actions and greatly expand them you can do a ton of tweaking to everything from how the stick behaves to pointer speed and acceleration to even the required breath force it's actually pretty deep and the best part is the amount of customization that they give you with the gestures with just sipping and puffing so like you can program up to 12 different actions with basically whatever key binding you want so so you could you know puff soft then hard for control-alt-delete or to launch the calculator or whatever the case may be it's awesome but wait there's more actually a lot more so you can execute functions with multiple types of gestures not just sipping and puffing like by moving the stick to the edge and holding for example check this out there it is and you can actually create a gesture to switch modes giving you a whole other layer of commands on the fly using those same sips and puffs or hold stick to edges and then what's cool is you can import and export your settings so you can optimize the mouse or the quad joy as it were for different applications on your computer leading us of course then to the question with all this customization can you game on it well record cool did I help you really in the net alright so believe it or not it depends on the game you can actually play something like rocket League with near full functionality since all you need is movement with the stick and then boost and jump can be done with your breaths pretty cool right and even mouse centric games like RTS RPG or board games were shockingly functional now the trick each onra is FPS so can it run Crysis ok technically this isn't crisis but whatever the same principle is applied now to do this properly you'd really want to joysticks one for looking around and then one for moving and we couldn't find an effective way to do both of those things at the same time on the quad joy so the best we managed was using the stick to look and then just inhaling to move forward and then puffing the shoot now it technically works but it's a pretty bad time but what if you used the stick to run around been stopped switch mouse modes to look around a name and shoot and then switch back to keep moving that's basically what twitch dreamer rocky no hands does and odds are he can absolutely pone you at fortnight however he uses a different controller the quad stick so would this approach work on the quad joy ah unfortunately no because the software doesn't let you bind stick movements to key presses like up equals W what they do offer is a sold separately 210 dollar feature called joystick mode that we actually ended up needing third party software called joy to key to fully utilize it does allow you to move around using the stick but it creates a new problem so they don't actually let you do gestures in joystick mode so you have no way to quickly switch back to Mouse mode when you're done moving around and it's time to aim and fire at something all right then so assuming you're in the market for a mouse mouse should you buy the plod joy if you're a gamer well it's clearly not designed with gaming in mind but for general computer use there are really a lot of great things about it that are hampered by a couple of complaints one the amount of play on the mounting arm is in our minds unacceptable for something that costs complaint number two this much this wiggle in the mount right down here amounts to a significant dead zone in either the X or the y axis depending on which way you mount it and at $1400 quad joy costs about double what the quad stick does and that one has been proven to be performance enough for competitive gaming and with multiple mouth options so I don't see why you might not start there instead though GB we haven't tested any of the other products in the market and we're not really the target consumer for these products anyway the purpose of this video for us was to experience a type of mouse input that we had never tried before and draw attention to a segment of the market that really doesn't get talked about much so if you have experience with either of the products we've talked about or maybe another one we didn't cover please leave a message in the comment section below tech tips and get
