report there are four items on the rover report excellent Kevin Randy here all busy something happening what's going on nothing okay wait up alright for our first story the borderlands 3 reviews are up so let's talk about some review roundup but before we do that i think it's obvious that i need to point out to you laptop cover i love it oh yeah Wow the other one was breaking a little bit yeah new new move new you new laptop cover sorry didn't mean the stuff I think I forgot that it was on because it might be the first show I've had the new cover module and worth pointing out of course that kind of funny games is working on a sponsorship with 2k and gearbox for Borderlands 3 so we're not gonna be reviewing the game as far as I'm aware I mean I'm not sure I'll be reviewing the gate up for damn sure Greg wrote that well we have no feedback to offer on reviews they've only had PC code available by the way we of course are working with 2k on the borderlands show and then he wrote in all caps ethics yeah I also said they're like we only have PC codes and we're like lol no same thing I was like where's some I have saw the reviews coming out today and I was like where's my scone I thought we were working with you guys and then Greg was like oh no it's just for PC and I was like dread I'll wait but we don't need to review it no does everyone else reviewed it exactly listen here's my thing I know I'm gonna love Borderlands 3 because I love Borderlands I don't need to slap a high score on it you guys know that I don't like putting scores on games but without further ado Metacritic is currently sitting at 85 which is fantastic 85 is an excellent score James Duggan over at IGN gave it a 9 point oh and he said if Borderlands three is what happens when a modern looter shooter doesn't concern itself with the longevity of its item economy in daily quest then you can sign me up for Borderlands for right now being untethered from persistent servers and able to trade loot at will is a refreshing change of pace but it's hardly the only reason why this is such an amazing co-op FPS the sheer magnitude and diversity of its arsenal of fun and surprising weaponry is unmatched and the striking amount of loving detail and variety packed into its energetic and replayable 30 our campaign is what makes Borderlands 3 a high point for the series and the genre as a whole Wow that's awkward over at Game Informer they gave it an 8.0 Matt Miller rights border lamps threes a love letter to his fans and a celebration of the style of play at first popularized filled with characters from previous installments and unapologetic and it's silly humor and bombastic action it's an amusing ride that seems hesitant to innovate if more of what you loved before is your chief desire gearbox has granted that wish through a game of impressive scope that charts some very safe territory and then PC gamer coming in with a 60-watt James Davenport writes Borderlands 3 is the Family Circus by way of Spencer's gifts yikes a game with long earnest quests about how darn good coffee is punctuated by gore and gun violence Borderlands 3 walks by dog poop points at it and laughs and then sets it on fire Borderlands 3 stays up until 11:30 p.m. drinking soda and googling crass flash animations taking detailed notes it's stuck in the late 2000s when surface level vulgarity was enough to qualify as edgy Borderlands 3 is seriously obsessed with turds when the series was first conceived its stuck at a time when memes lasted months rather than days when referential humor was still a novelty not exhausting when you could point at something the slightest bit abnormal or gross and call it a joke simpler times not necessarily better times that's interesting that's always kind of been my vibe of Borderlands as a pretty much outsider played a little bit of one back in the day I mean I watched Alfredo play through almost the entire thing and I always was like it's a little too just like haha jokey joke for me but it's interesting to see the the three reviews here and how they all kind of there's the similarities but then there's also the really just it's decided by your tastes ah are you into that type of humor do you get that this is a game that is made to feel like the other previous installments or are you looking for something new because if you are this is probably not for you but I think that if you're in the borderlands 3 and excited for lines 30 you already know that right well games that really rely a lot on humor as part of their narrative are always going to be more divisive than games that don't I even think about the South Park RPG series and how divisive that was purely because it was South Park and they have a very poignant point of view on their humor so I think that this is going to be fine for people who love it and I'm okay with that I think everything I've said about the game so far from what I've played in preview events has shown that it's more of the same but with a higher level of polish with some added bells and whistles and that's really all I wanted because if they're gonna innovate the series now I feel like it's too early and this franchise to do a major overhaul in the mechanics and the systems but also like don't take that risk you know go with what you know go with what your fans want and then next time you know if they have the technology of the next generation that they're working towards they can maybe do some new innovative cool things yeah so but we're at the end of this console cycle generally what we see at the end of the console cycle is exactly this it's something that's highly polished but not necessarily something that's incredibly innovative yeah so I'm excited to play it's gonna be fun mm-hmm I'm excited for this next news story Andrea yeah Sam you want to read this one yes I do Resident Evil project resistant teased this comes from map her slow at IGN as promised by Capcom recently a new Resident Evil game project resistance has been with a short teaser trailer ahead of its gameplay debut at Tokyo Game Show this week the trailer shows four characters and what appears to be an umbrella laboratory there repeatedly attacked by zombies and a licker that appeared to be unleashed by an unseen shadowy presence in a control room the person in shadow ends the trailer by putting on a pair of mechanical gloves that glow with red LEDs which are mirrored by two glowing red eyes beneath the brim of a tyrants hat seemingly suggesting that this antagonist has the power to control one of Resident Evil's most notorious enemies the trailer further teases the fan theory of project resistance being a four player co-op game possibly eating a new resin Evil Outbreak title the situation in the video certainly appears like a four player horde like situation and one of the characters jackets looks like it could be a Raccoon City University jacket a location featured in Resident Evil Outbreak further information will be available at TGS this week starting on Thursday September 12th gameplay footage has been promised in anyone planning to attend the show in person can see the game at the resistance booth Oh exciting I've said it before and I'll say it again the re engine is my favorite engine in video games it just makes things look so good to the point that you watch that tree line is this CG or is this an engine it's an engine that is insane it's a beautiful it's gorgeous alright shadows and everything adds so nicely to a game like Resident Evil because it adds to the fear there's nothing scarier than seeing the little flicker of reflections in water or shadows that you think as a zombie coming around the corner and like that I feel is what really kind of reestablished what survival horror games and Resident Evil games in particular can be and then to see what they did with DMC 5 a totally different genre of game but it still added so much because it's just breathtakingly beautiful to add it now to a four-player horde mode Resident Evil is it necessarily what I want from Resident Evil no but this trailer I was like alright you're kind of ticking the boxes of things to get me interested with all of the like this looks like Ari 2 multiplayer I'm down for that yeah and I Baron if you wouldn't mind pulling the trailer up that would be excellence who can take a look at it for people who are watching with us right now umm I wouldn't have believed you if I hadn't played Resident Evil 2 remake for myself and just seeing how fantastic the graphics look in that game and how well it played in the and everything they've done to revamp real quick I do wanna say I'm not entirely sure that it's not CG but I'm with you having played it it does look like that when the moment engine of disbelief is there the moments in re two playing through it where I was just like how is this a game like we're plentiful absolutely I'm with you and like the lighting and everything super atmospheric so of course not only is Tim excited but my was good games co-host Britney bra Walker was all kinds of excited when the story this morning yeah she was tweeting about it last night she she was gonna wake up early for the reveal and so I tried to get her on the phone this morning but she's uh at the vet with her dog Reb just doing some routine checkup work don't worry everyone's okay but she did text me this I am a glass case of emotion all caps I really hope this is a true co-op and not for B one it looks like a could be four view on with the mystery man flipping the switches I'd like to think that set mystery man is Wesker pre re five [ __ ] with some unfortunate souls that found themselves in the worst possible place it has to be pre re five because of the game Wesker one of the main baddies of the earlier games becomes a toasty lava man and he's real dead I love that we have traditional re bioweapons and since the garb of these kids looks in the 90s I'd be surprised if we see anything from RE 4 and up all interesting stuff yeah I could buy that I do think it's gonna be 4 V 1 asymmetric type gameplay with somebody playing as the guy behind it I kind of study the different traps and unlocking they just exploded I guess their garb does kind of look a little 90s but I mean that could be from today too though it's retro chic baby very chic so Brittany also wrote it'd be amazing at this game assuming it takes place sometime around re2 showed us a side of the city from a survivors perspective and what those weeks were like post outbreak in Raccoon City my nights are it's not gonna have much story at all I think I think she's being a little bit hopeful alright having its time I appreciate that I appreciate that tying in cuz like if I remember correctly the outbreak games aren't Canon to the the main storylines I'm the wrong person des but I enjoyed the outbreak games back in the day but I'd never really liked one of them for their story it was more for the like novelty of playing an re game with other people right and she said TL DR give me more outbreak and I was kind of looking at some of the responses on Twitter and it seems like re fans are kind of splits like half of them really love outbreak the other half are like I don't want this thing I feel like it's not re fans that are split it's video game plan fans because I re fans love outbreak I think it's more of a thing of the people that are you know more just like oh I'll dabble like like me I would say like me yeah it's just like I'd rather re remake three or a new Resident Evil whatever it is as opposed to this right but I think that the people that have played all of them religiously are gonna be super stoked cuz those were some of the better ones like there was a I keep forgetting the name of the OM Brella there's an evil umbrella something that came out there was a kind of a successor to outbreak and it was not good last gen I'm looking up the list of games Resident Evil umbrella core yes 2016 yep that's it did not like that game this is gonna be more similar to outbreak and also just there's a level they've been knocking it out of the park Capcom cap got their back baby like ever since monster under came out monster in the world they really just kind of like hey look we understand that we've had a couple years of really really really bad decisions but we're gonna put out quality content Monster Hunter becoming their number one selling game then we got on about the timing on this but Resident Evil 7 right fantastic Resident Evil 2 fantastic doesn't me cry 5 fantastic like boom boom boom boom I kind of give them the the luxury to kind of do something that seems a little bit different now because I trust that they're gonna put out a quality product I'm with you yeah I think it was Resident Evil 7 that really kind of kick-started at all because that was the first and then Monster Hunter world came out and Monster Hunter was kind of a bit of a slow burn and obviously had a pop at launch but it's continued to sell well and now the new DLC ice-born is and so I think it's gonna be issues to see where they go with their other franchises in addition to where they take the franchises that have been doing well for them so yeah we'll know more later this week I imagine Friday's kfj D you guys will have something to say but let's move on to the next story shall we mmm-hmm this is another one Barrett that I'm gonna ask you to pull up you can see the hyperlink in the title there Nintendo patent shows curved Joey Kahn design what woods Nintendo has patented a new joint Kahn design which would allow for controllers shaped a little differently with the top half of each tilted downwards this of course is from Eurogamer this story let me see here where did I leave off there doesn't seem to be any added functionality here just potentially more ergonomic fit in your hand each joy kong would didn't sell dock on to the main switch unit using a hinge attachment rail the patent dug up over the weekend on reddit is publicly viewable but it's worth remembering that this is still far from confirmation the idea will actually see the light of day if it ever does Nintendo has a history of patenting ideas which never leave the idea stage remember the sleep monitor with a ceiling projector remember the working Gameboy shelf for your smartphone no the controller with scroll wheels I don't remember any of these things what about that flexible Nintendo switch hoop oh wait that one's actually real it's unbelievable we'll see we'll see whatever that is or is it gonna go the way of the little health adapter thing you just stick your finger in it you know Tom about know the vitality sensor no I don't remember that at all I had the balance board the double does a scale that you could like do yoga on or whatever we actually we used it when Thanksgiving to do pre and post weigh-ins with everybody just for funsies for seeing them with one girl in our group gained seven pounds that Thanksgiving oh my god and for her please oh my gosh what blood pressure we don't need the video just like yeah click on that image yeah a water [ __ ] came out on stage and said this is the thing that we're doing and then they never did it but that was that man it was definitely full of some weird ideas I don't know how I feel about these curved joi cons I don't think that they're ever gonna actually come out but I can see an intended is getting weird they like to iterate on other things and might as well put out more stuff for people to buy because they know that people will get the ergonomics of it but also just like this doesn't solve any of the problems of the Joye cons I've never been holding the the switch in handheld mode and being like damn I really wished it was just a little bit more comfortable I'm like I wish I had a d-pad yeah I wish I had bigger buttons I wish the joysticks were bigger yeah yeah like there's a lot of wishes I have Barret I'd put another thing it's black on the dock you see that yeah if you can open that up this is another thing a new pattern appears for an improved Nintendo switch VR headset design so building off of what they did with lab Oh which I thought was when they when we originally saw those publicity photos her lab Oh with the kids like holding it up to their face I was like this is not a thing that's actually happening right like first off who wants to put cardboard on their face that doesn't feel comfortable then you have to hold it up there I think I was hosting with Fran that day and he kept talking about how it'd be like the best shoulder workout ever though if you just had to hold stuff at your face level for like look at how cool a time that could be us Andrea it could be us be doing the VR mode of Smash Brothers now we need a Photoshop of this if there is an enterprise best friend out there what's Photoshop Gemini old and is Andre from GameXplain I has been doing all of the the VR things that have been coming out for Nintendo and like according to him it's like it is kind of a range a lot of them purchase like what it what is the point of this is a waste of development time and then some of them like these are kind of neat experiences that work better than they should yes but it's just kind of seems like such a weird half step that only Nintendo would make yeah they do like to experiment I want to give them you know praise for innovating and doing things that nobody else is thinking of but also being able to fail quickly and move on because that is the sign of I think somebody who's very successful to say hey I'm gonna try something and if it doesn't work out I'm gonna move on to the next thing really quickly and not try to like make it work even though it's very clearly not working what do we know you didn't think that we worked know that we worked in many ways what didn't work is like we're gonna shoehorn these motion controls into every game every game now that you're getting bored of that here's a vitality sensor [ __ ] nah son daddy get [ __ ] too but he has bad taste oh my gosh he does sometimes have been doesn't you say that the Wii controller is like the best controller no I just we got into an argument one time about him saying that how many amazing games that we had and I was like named five name five amazing games and he just started naming games that were on the way different things like yeah we've had a lot of games I misread can't even accomplish you're wrong says the Nintendo sleep monitor is coming with Pokemon go Plus for Pokemon sleep it's so much Dead Yet that's right that's right and he also writes that the Nintendo health sensor is not for checking blood pressure in the hospital it is called a pulse oximeter and it is used to check heart rate in oxygen saturation in the blood well thanks thrilling gameplay mechanics there it's all about that oxygen saturation Tim oh man well let's move on to another controversial story is it an X button or a cross button as Vick you later Eurogamer the symbol that is the southernmost position of the four buttons on your Dual Shock controller what do you call it thanks X if you're a rational mind you'll probably call it the X button right that's what I call and that's what my passcode I mean we've all seen detractors those unsettling people who wait for it call it cross ha they're just being contrary we all know the truth we know we're right except we're not after the latest what you call this button debate raged on social media PlayStation UK decided to wait in only instead of clearing everything up all I've done is blow our collective minds a carton deflation ex is wrong I'm wrong we're all wrong and it's if I can barely take this my fingers are shaking so badly it is a deed called a cross triangle circle cross square places in UK insisted if cross is called X it's not then what are you calling circle o I mean no one calls it oh it's definitely an X like there there wrong here let me here's the thing I don't understand why this is becoming a story now like I get that PlayStation tweeted it so it's all thing but if you look at any of their merch or anything they never put out it says cross like the sacred symbols like it's its cross like they've said that yeah they are [ __ ] wrong like people call it X but it doesn't matter it is cross it's like the guy who made gift like he'll pronounces a deal with that the last thing is like like PS I love you xoxo that we had you no one calls it oh no one's upset about that like visually you look at it you get it you know what I mean yeah this is anything when you're talking you saying numbers and like alright you're giving someone's phone number who says zero people say oh I say zero sometimes I know you don't I I do don't believe no no I'm sorry Tim like when when uh when there's an error on a website mm-hmm what do you call that 404 there you go yeah doesn't mean I don't say zero when I give my phone number okay I'm with you I'm with you but it was interesting is that there's a you know you had dropped in this image of somebody responding to the tweet that PlayStation UK made talking about crosses having the same distance between each stick but that X is former rectangle but doesn't a lowercase X have aren't they the exact same as a cross because this looks like an uppercase X to me no even a lowercase X it has it's just smaller than the like capital don't look at him here so I type them into the doc here doesn't make him really big wait what's happening no stop it computer if you tie back three times and hit Search crazy [ __ ] happens don't do it did you pull the damage looks symmetrical oh I feel you but I mean I haven't I'm not measuring it with Photoshop it's possible that I'm drawing so this is the tweet that we're talking about it's from at SAE Crimson responding to PlayStation UK says because this debate grinds my gears I'll finish it once and for all crosses have the same distance between each stick crosses four more square exes don't have the same distance between each stick excess form a rectangle basic geometry and then he's got a little diagram with an X and a cross next to each other but like I said if it's a lowercase X mm-hmm not sure how it works out here's the thing that's our lowercase X though that pink thing no it's a cross I feel like this is one of those things like PlayStation UK coming in trying to speak for Allah please also color with a u yeah there okay cross this out continue to call that button the next button or we can just wait until all the game console makers decide to get together in a room and say hey you know what PlayStation buttons got it right let's just call everything X square circle triangle so then everyone will understand what button they're supposed to press at all times unlike Nintendo and Xbox I'm sorry I understand ABXY are like they were what started at all right but at this point it's too muddled it's too confusing yeah people are too used to too many things at the very least Alexa use the accept button as the southernmost button Nintendo making it the right button like it's the Japanese thing that's a problem that's the only reason is they do that because like back on the day back in the day in the PlayStation Metal Gear Solid Final Fantasy games there was the right button as well so weird Tim I don't like it use in color and right side except buttons what's next calling these buzz cross buttons heck no I'll just did right in about this is to say the X button is actually cross button but who cares it just seems like this is an argument for argument's sake to me this button will always be an X button where most people won't even see this and continue calling a meteor or shooting star even though it's technically a difference in both in these cases I didn't realize that how do you fall on this debate it will always be next to you or do you listen to the logic some people have put out will fall the way the inventor it secreted to be also this is not the inventor this is somebody on the social media team for PlayStation UK just like running wild with this thing they're not running wild like there's there should we call up like hardware architect my Rosie and be like what's going on there's a brand style book that says cross for PlayStation guys but it's next is this like the ad at 8080 thing people always say both I feel like that is a tomato tomahto really no one says tomahto have you ever been someone that says tomorrow my son let's date and have a funny accent I've met some people in Australia who say tomahto and some people in the UK that say tomahto mmm a friend of mine once had a t-shirt that said you say tomato I say [ __ ] you and I loved it it was the best yeah and it was like a really smiley tomato on the front I was like I want that shirt anyway I digress me getting that shirt Tim I'm so far away if I wanted something in my hands today like what came to the bow and grab digital shots where would I go the official list of upcoming software across each every platform is listed by the kind of fun and games Daily Show host each and every weekday dududududududu I always do that best I want you to know that my final show with you I want to

there with an online games like creation of the 2k sports franchise pre Boonton menu that is now common for all consoles vmu games some of the first second-screen experiences and of course the Sonic Adventure series music it was the first console I ever owned and it's still one of the best consoles of all time I asked today that we all take time and reflect on our Dreamcast memories and remember the last console that Sega made you know I'm just gonna come out and say it the Dreamcast I think is the most overrated console of all time and people's memories of it always surprised me and I get there's different taste out there everyone has their things I will say though Borton you're making a very compelling argument here there's a lot of things that I haven't thought about in the context of influencing video games and where they're at now because like he's right like the 2k games were the first real console online experiences that I feel hit mainstream yes you could play games before like even as far back as like the Super Nintendo using online connections and stuff but the two key games made that something that was like a experience that was part of the general zeitgeist and I feel like a later Halo kind of like knocked out of the park changed the game with Xbox Live but you needed that that boost that the Dreamcast gave the the pre-boot menu and stuff that's right it was the first one it was the first kind of introduction to a lot of these a lot of these different features that we now just have it all open yeah but in terms of memories of Dreamcast I I remember being very excited going in I was always a sonic kid I mean of course I'm a Nintendo kid first and foremost but I love platformers and I loved Sonic and I couldn't wait to see the transition into a 3d game and when adventure launched with it and then later going into adventure 2 I was so hyped to be able to play it even though I didn't own the console and I wanted it so bad and it wasn't until years later that I played Sonic Adventure 2 battle on the Gamecube when it finally got released I was so excited that I finally got to play this game and then I played the game you're right the Sonic Adventure music is just chefs cos it's fantastic escape from the city are you kidding me but the games are at most a third good a 2/3 bad yeah I'm looking at the list of Dreamcast games trying to remember what I even played on Dreamcast because I didn't spend very much time with my Dreamcast I was very much a Nintendo 64 girl and but yeah none of these are like sparking like oh hey yeah I really remember playing that I feel like the Dreamcast is the Jared Petty of consoles not to mention Gary petty twice in one episode say one more time he'll he'll appear but you know it had we had the weird games like see man you know and it had it did have the NBA 2k games and I fell to K games and then on top of that there was the sonic adventure games and I feel like there was a lot of just obscure Japanese experimental games with a shampoo and then there was Shenmue the rise of Shenmue right like that that was a big moment for for Dreamcast for Sega but at the end of the day there's a reason things would happen the way that they did it's true bear do you have any Dreamcast memories or were you not born yet which last week see here's the one like the real shout out sorry bad the last thing is a shout out to Dreamcast for its successes it was so good at emulating arcade games and the infant because the infrastructure was the same so games like Power Stone games like Marvel vs. Capcom - like the Dreamcast had the definitive console version of MVC - like that's important especially during that time when our K games were maybe not an all-time high but close to it Barret yeah I was an n64 kid it was this Sega's last console mm-hmm there's a reason for that but a lot of people are saying Jet Set Radio they wanted to give that a shout out so Jet Set Radio another game though that honestly I never loved the soundtrack was cool the look was cool but yeah I played it like way too like I've played that like my friend's house in high school and I was like I don't get it why is it school we're the wrong people to be celebrating the Dreamcast all right let's go on to the next question here Evan M Wrightson says good morning Tim good morning Evan tomorrow is the new yearly iPhone reveal and that would be remiss to not mention it with Tim on the show because Apple has recently been publishing games from real traditional game tips that game company comes to mind do you think we will see any gaming news at tomorrow's iPhone conference mobile games are a big deal to most of the world it seems like the perfect time to speak to that audience however without knowing too much about how Apple structures their announcement and conferences will we see any exciting news about Apple mobile exclusive games thanks for all you do and good luck the indriya down in LA Evan M yes yes absolutely Apple arcade is absolutely going to make an appearance and we know that for sure because for the first time ever kind of funny and Greg Miller were invited to go oh the iPhone event and that would only happen if they're gonna talk about games is he going right yes going that's really cool pretty damn cool wanted to go to MIT but the weird thing is it's like I don't think it's gonna be as cool as you'd think like going to an e3 press conference is fun because there's like crazy and fanfare just like there's an energy to it where's like the Apple presentations I mean unless you were there from so for some of the like real iconic ones which tomorrow is not going to be yeah and like the rumors going in that at this point seemed pretty confirmed well here's some stuff about Apple arcade we're getting out the iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro some form of a cheaper one and [Music] the big one more thing a moment that people are expecting is a tile like system where there'll be this little circular apple sticker kind of thing that you can put on to stuff and they're expanding the Find My iPhone feature to be just find my and then you can like okay it on your laptop that's not an example because you can already do that you can put it on Barrett's hop and then yeah that's I think that's really kind of what they're they're pushing there's like leaked images of like keychains with it on it yeah you have a wallet you can stick it inside your wallet or your purse or something because I need to find him at all times we had an engagement ring scare do you think I could put it on to the engagement right you could no but you should have a separate insurance policy for it you need help with a scare we like freaked out for like 10 minutes and then we just realizes on the nightstand it was like okay this is why you have a ring dish and our in the Drake household we have three locations for the ring dish and that's the only place the Rings go you take it off they must go to one of these three locations so you always know where yeah it was a weird spot cuz it she never puts it on my nightstand in my nightstand does not have a ring disc but she does after that happened she's like I gotta get a [ __ ] ring disc for that nightstand mm-hmm and you can get so many key ones we should make a kind of funny ring dish let's do it it would be cute the little face so I wanted to pull up a story that was posted on Mac world today talking about the Apple arcade release gate release date games lists and price rumors so this was posted seven hours ago by David Price who said that Apple arcade was first revealed of course at Apple spring press event back in March and that the release date is scheduled to be mmm we're hoping that they're going to give the release date I thought they'd get here we're hoping they're gonna give them released it at the event tomorrow we're ideally in a perfect world they'd say it's out today but if not out tomorrow or this week that they'll hopefully lock launch it or soft launch it sometime this fall the price is rumored to be $4.99 a month and you get a free month one-month trial will be available as with news plus the standard fee will include family so it's up to six people will be able to share a subscription and according to reports Apple will collect the monthly fees from subscribers and the revenue from these subscriptions will then be divided up between developers based on how much time users spent playing their game mm-hmm what games are included and just so we go back to the question here from Evan Apple has been working with big video game developers and publishers for a long time I'm not sure why Skyy from that game company was the one that you thought at first but since Apple's been making games that major publishers have been releasing stuff in the App Store so I think it was like the first time that they had a big deal kind of critically acclaimed game studio working on an original game that was exclusively exclusively well I mean I guess even then it's not but yeah exclusively for mobile right right which did sky and hip gum in the switch all right I think it's going to at some point yeah but whatever it's like undeniable that Sky's focus was mobile I was like before we had Infinity Blade from epic but like that I would even say is different because epic and now they were kind of a bit more of like a household name but I think that then that was their mind no one was surprised they're working on mobile stuff because it was money to be made there well I mean it was chair that made Infinity Blade and I vividly remember when that first game came out because I was still hosting that iPad show like way back in the day it was a really big deal because games on ipad you know word this brand new thing that were happening and having games specifically developed for the glass and and touch controls was a very specific type of gaming that a lot of people back then and some even today don't consider real gaming they consider it casual gaming and I'm not here to debate the merits of what casual versus hardcore is because I think a lot of people have a variety of definitions but I've always been of the mindset that mobile games frequently could overlooked by people who only play on PC and console and there's so many fantastic mobile gaming experiences out there so I'm excited to see what they're gonna bring I hope that they have some really cool reveals with apple arcade I hope we get the final pricing I hope we get the release date I've been someone who's loved playing games on my iPhone and I would love to see what they're gonna offer so that is starting that I believe the same time the games daily is starting tomorrow yeah we'll have to be like get a live report at some point we'll check in during the show counterpoint to your point about this is okay I too enjoy mobile games very often but I've never found myself really enjoying the the mobile games the way that they present them at these shows and I think I'm pushing out apple arcade won't change that because I feel like whenever it's these big triple-a titles that they're trying to push mobile triple-a titles right it's like it always kind of feels trihard like it feels like they're trying to change people's mind stuff like no but look you can have your console experience here too well as I feel like the value and power of mobile games is kind of that time wasting in a good way value of just checking in every once in a while to play through and get the thing of the day or whatever it is and I feel like the games that kind of really succeed on mobile are the ones that just happen and then you start hearing about right mm-hmm whereas like the ones that Apple are kind of trying to cure it for you in my experience aren't the ones that I'm like alright this is what's up Super Mario run comes to mind I think there's two different two different things to unpack there I think I'm with you that Apple clearly is working with major tentpole partners in probably what is a paid sponsorship type scenario right I'm sure Apple paid for excuse me Nintendo paid for placement for Super Mario run the press conference as Apple wanting the headline to be associated with a company like Nintendo absolutely and I think that's the thing is like they use this more as like that in the same way that you a has all of its sports games in its press conferences at e3 to get the Wall Street Journal headline I think it's the same thing of Apple wants to have the real players in video games as part of their gaming section of their press conferences so that people like the IGN's of the world would be like oh [ __ ] you know I mean like they're partnering with Nintendo you need a much more detailed and interesting write-up about a Mario game coming to Apple then here's racing game number 3004 absolutely agree with you 100% it's really an interesting strategy because the mobile games that are the successful are played by people who never watch a show like KF GD you never read i GN calm and I am kind of curious as to how Apple is going to lean in to the people who are actually buying games on their platform and playing hundreds of millions of hours of these games monthly with Apple arcade and what they're going to choose to focus on so yeah I hope that I'm wrong I hope that Apple can come out with a game that they're like look weird we've learned so much over the last decade of the App Store existing that we are finally ready to present to you a reason why Apple arcade makes sense you know I just doubt it well we'll find out tomorrow next question will probably be our last one so let's see here mmm is there any one of these that are speaking to you mmm what do you think 20:38 Pokemon CEO at the end there yeah why not looking back at your freshman year in the industry what advice would you give yourself bonus anything in regards to networking yes the link tree link from oh yeah he already said you guys so Tim looking back at your freshman year in the industry what advice would you give young Tim presentation matters a lot how you present yourself visually and how you speak to people and all of that really matters and your first impressions are so so so important and you don't want to get written off as a joke to people and I mean you guys have seen me my entire career at this point and it's just like it'd be pretty easy to look at me how I used to dress how I used to act and be like oh this kid this kid [ __ ] kid you know what I mean try to not look like a kid the sooner that you can have that grow up moment I think people will respect you a lot more and you'll respect your work you don't want to get stuck being known as the intern you don't mean even if you are the intern you want to be like you want to graduate from that as soon as possible there's nothing wrong with being the intern that's a good thing well we all do our time yeah you got it but I just think that people there it's pretty easy to get stuck in having everybody think of you a certain way that's gonna pigeonhole you at the end of the day and I think a lot of that has to do with just how you present yourself how you present your opinions understanding that like not everything is about you and you maybe you shouldn't come up with hashtags say that you should host things hosting everything that's really good advice looking back at my freshman year in the industry I would probably tell myself to believe in myself more I had a lot of struggles early on in my career being surrounded by a lot of what they would deem as like hardcore video game nerds telling me that I wasn't a gamer enough that I didn't play the right kinds of games that my knowledge wasn't as deep as theirs and specific franchises therefore I was unqualified to do my job but I look back on it now and I never understood today why I let it get to me so bad back then and I think imposter syndrome is real for people of all walks of life no matter what kind of job you're in and you just have to wake up every morning believing that you are doing the best that you can do by doing the best that you can do and just keep proving them wrong you know don't give up on yourself and always strive to make yourself better and keep educating and keep pushing and if I could you know talk to you know Andrea like at the very beginning of my career that's what I would say to myself and anything in regards to networking I have a key piece of advice there don't ever let your ego get in the way and just always say hi to people always introduce yourself and remind people who you are because a big thing is everyone's had that moment where you're walking and then you see somebody that you went to high school with and you're decide oh I don't want to talk to them you don't even you just have that feeling where you try your best to avoid eye-contact and all of that you know the best way to just own that situation look at them like hey all of a sudden that means you are in control you were the better person that was able to do thing and like they're not gonna judge you for that they're gonna be like oh I recognize them they recognize me and if they don't recognize you it's totally fun it's just like okay at least I threw some positivity that way and in the industry something I learned pretty early on is I and to this day this still happens where I've been with Greg so often at events or I've been with with people that like know more people than I do and I constantly am like okay I know you but I don't know if you know me so introduce yourself just say hey I'm Tim said give say who you're like I'm with IGN or whatever and they're like oh I know whatever it's like you just need to help them understand who you are and don't ever feel like like oh man they should know who I am don't ever feel that way it doesn't matter how big you get always act like nobody knows who you are and it's funny that this is coming up because I remember with you it would be this way I met you it feels like a decade ago at this point this is like yeah like I guess 2012 yeah I was 2012 seven years and and in those first early years I'd see you every couple months at different events and stuff but I knew you knew Greg but I was like I don't know Schumer's who I am I'm just the intern or I'm just the this or whatever but I always would act like I know you say hi reintroduce myself if I needed to or whatever and then I hit a point now we know each other you know but I just think that that is that's real important advice that I see a lot of people [ __ ] up networking is crucial to your success in whatever your walk of life is or whatever your profession is and particularly if you want to go into an entertainment field it's really all about who you know and that was a tough lesson for me to learn as a young person as well because I think we all want to be judged on our merits and not judged on who we know and not necessarily get an opportunity because we knew the guy who knew the girl or you're friends with or relatives with somebody but you always want to work with people that you've worked with before when I go to hire somebody I usually think who have I worked with already that I can that I can you know hire and so you get those opportunities by networking so if you do have the opportunity to go to a mixer or an event I know sometimes it can be challenging particularly if you suffer from you know social anxiety or you don't do well with crowds or if you're more of an introvert going into those large group settings can be really daunting for you but I would really push you to get outside your comfort zone even if it's just to like sit at the bar and maybe sit by yourself or you know to like you know bring a single friend every opportunity you have to meet somebody at an event could be the next big opportunity for you and you never know when those introductions are going to happen we're going a little long on this but the one last one I want to make about it is those situations where it's like there's a mixer or something about video games go there's a pax where there's community meetups go talk to people and meet people because we all like the same things we always talk about this was kind of funny meet and greets come talk to each other or we all like video games so start talking my video games and you're gonna be able to get a conversation going next thing you know you have a friend and I just went to a wedding in Tahoe that was from one of Gia's friends none of them could give a [ __ ] about video games or any of my life anything's going on and I'm stuck with a bunch of people in a room that I have nothing in common with and I'm just like I hate this I just want to get a patch right now and it just made me realize that it's like wow there is so special about our industry and that there are places you can go and so many different opportunities to meet people that are like-minded that it's not just about advancing your career but you never know if that is your goal you all you need to do is meet somebody and it's gonna change everything amen to that all right and that is going to do it for this episode of kind of funny games daily tomorrow's host is me and Gary Whitta whoo because Greg is gonna be at the Apple event and then Wednesday is my final KF GD with Greg send in all the questions it's gonna be fun and then Greg and Tim are closing out Thursday and Friday so they'll talk to you
