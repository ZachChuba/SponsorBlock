- [Dan] There it is. You can see the water. Splashy. Yeah, there's definitely water in there. What've we got here? - Based on the eye it
looks like a rock but, Yeah, that's a Brazilian enhydro agate. Judging solely on taste I'd say it's about two million, five hundred
and seventy nine thousand, four hundred and twenty ... Yep, twenty four years old. - [Dan] So we've got a really old rock, that has water inside of it. And I think it's pretty
safe to assume that the water inside of it is
about the same age as the rock. - I'd say that's safe to assume. Old water. - [Dan] We want to pull
the water out of this so that Mitchell can taste
test the oldest water that we could get our hands on. - That's gonna be good. - [Dan] And then we're going
to grow a culture of it in this sheep blood agar and then we'll also
take some other cultures of Mitchell's mouth and maybe something else that he licked just so we have some baseline comparisons. Step one, we gotta drill a hole through it to extract it. (drill noise) - [Voiceover] One eternity later. - [Dan] Apparently quartz is
a lot harder than we thought This is plan B. Oh! We found the water. Loosen the vice up, we'll try not to dump this. Get in there nice and deep. - [Mitchell] And then what do we just ... - [Dan] Yeah, just, yeah.
Something like that. - I'm a little worried. - [Dan] What about? - Death. (Dan laughs) - [Dan] Salty? Kind of a stink to it. (Dan laughs) - [Dan] For these two, we need to get a good swab of your mouth. - Not the whole mouth, just the tongue. - [Dan] See what we can grow on this one. Okay and this is probably
the grossest thing that Mitchell has licked. The gas pump handle. - [Mitchell] Oh I've
squished it into the blood. - [Dan] We've got all three samples now. Next step Mitchell's
going to take these home sit on them for a week to incubate them And then we'll see if Mitchell will die. - [Voiceover] One week later. - [Dan] Results are in, first up Mitchell's tongue. What's your prediction on this one? - My prediction is that one is for sure going to be the nastiest. - [Dan] Well, we have
nothing to compare it to, but that doesn't look that bad. The gas pump, that one, Oh gosh. - [Mitchell] Mushrooms growing in it. - [Dan] (laughs) Remember when you licked that? - [Mitchell] Now I've got those
antibodies built up in me. - [Dan] (laughs) For what? - [Mitchell] For gas pumps! - [Dan] The rock water, Let's see if Mitchell
should be dead right now. Hmm, oh there's definitely
some stuff in there. That really surprises me. I thought for sure that water
would have been sterile. - [Mitchell] See here's
what this goes to prove. Because my mouth has so many antibodies it has killed everything that would have grown. - [Dan] So when you licked these, your mouth actually cleansed it. That makes sense. - Proven by science. - [Dan] I guess the
last thing we have to do is just cut the rock. (upbeat music) And now we got a clean edge where you can see inside. It's all beautiful. (upbeat music)
