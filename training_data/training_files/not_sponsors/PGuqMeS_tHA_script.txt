you you are a hundred percent allowed to stick a catheter up anywhere in my body it'll be an honor you've been on earth to me can you do a workout stream with your model i mean i can't but like moving voluntarily true like no wait but the reason i was saying that is because i see you have these like pre-built-in dances so you don't even have to do it you know you mean this thing right this yeah yeah oh my god that looks so cool thank you this is me actually dancing can you believe it it's i believe it i'm gonna dance like this for 24 hours you're secretly a kpop starlet i am i have oh my god do you think riot games would hit me up oh that would be such a cool collab kda featuring code nico let's go let's go i can dance like this for 24 hours ah god damn okay 24 hours i don't know what's going on let's start glitching one second what was the craziest gift or the most unique gift that you got for your viewers um i don't know so much about what i got as opposed to what i've seen in certain wish lists tell me tell me like how do i say this um very very very very large or anime related coomer gifts like uh like figurines or like things you can interact with or utilize figure figurines with joints um yeah stuff like that and just how do i say clocks yeah wow i gotta show you something so i'm here for it i've been i wanted to get as much of your merchandise as possible so i got your youtube name thank you i got this mousepad it was it doesn't even come out yet right yeah it's how did you get that i yoinked it and this is really impressive thank you this is a fake pokeman as well you probably got that off amazon yeah i probably did so much fake pokey anyways i've noticed that i was looking i don't know what i always see another streamer miss gif you probably haven't heard of him looking at all this pokey merch on amazon i don't know why i don't even me that comes out with it how do you get so many of fake stuff on amazon is it is it miss kit doing though is it miss gif oh my god maybe he's the one making it and he's the one accidentally looking at it in order to promote on history ah that's genius exactly that is something that misgive would do actually you're right you're right wow how did you do that don't let him fool you with his adhd act exactly don't let you fool you so this is this is my desk right and then we wanted to get almost everything emerged but you know we we couldn't do it and then it took him so my assistant okay my assistant dorm uh found this pookie collection okay and it's actually what's pokey lol's bedroom collection and so now we just have a bunch of pokey lol bed sheets and pillows okay and now also his his body pillows and um honestly kind of cute i really like it did you know um years ago i used to live with poke laws really yeah we used to live together so we have many stories and back then we kept this facade that we were secretly brother and sister because i'm pokey and he's poke you know yeah people would get our names mixed up all the time and sometimes he would get business emails for me or i would get business emails people thinking i'm him so we would be like yeah actually we're just siblings we're not the same person but we are siblings do they still believe that i i bet some people still believe that uh probably there's probably some people out there for sure it's the internet people believes whatever they believe in everything [Music] that is kind of a banger [Music] i hear that you are a fan of ratchet music is that true a little bit i was gonna ask when you were dancing i was like can she twerk just wondering i mean you can do everything else you know i mean i can for you for me yeah for you i can do a twerk would you like to see it oh god she's got the movement in oh my god did she did you used to go outside sometimes yes really unfortunately yeah especially just to work out because when i thought about it like i mentally felt very guilty knowing that i'm on the computer for like 10 hours i was like i might as well go out for like 30 minutes a few times a week what does it lift a little weight um depends where you go in l.a yeah it's interesting what what what is it like again depends where you go a lot of people asking for your instagram handle i would say yeah that's la for you oh my god wait hey you wanna hear a funny story yes please which i found to be like the epitome of l.a this one time my friend who is like kind of la instagram girl sort of she was throwing a birthday party and she invited me and i was having a phase of like i want to make friends this

them whatever that night ends early and i'm about to head home and at the end of the night someone's like oh like i want to tag you in something you're like do you have an instagram and i had spoken to them a couple times throughout the night um i was like okay i call my uber and i show them my instagram and as soon as they see the number of followers on my instagram you know that one emote in chat that people use when you're gonna twerk where like yeah the eyes like yeah that one your face literally did that literally they did that and then all of a sudden i was just 50 times more
