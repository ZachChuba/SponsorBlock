hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with apple crumble coffee cake the hats right finally after all these
years i've come up with a delicious solution for people that can't decide
whether to make an apple crumble or a coffee cake and not only does this
feature the best things about both of those recipes but i think all fans a
Dutch apple pie are gonna love this as well so with that let's go ahead and get
started by quickly mixing up our dry ingredients which will include some
all-purpose flour some salt some baking powder and some baking soda and then
once we have all that in there we'll take a whisk and mix this for about half
a minute at which point the first of our three very simple components is done and
we will set that aside and move on to component number two which is our
crumble topping / filling and that's going to include a whole bunch of
chopped walnuts that I lightly toasted in a dry pan first and then to that we
will add some brown sugar and I'm using light brown but dark brown will work as
well and then we'll also do some white sugar as well as a nice big pinch of
salt and of course because this is a bacon that features walnuts and apples
it's pretty much a requirement that we have to add a spoon of cinnamon and then
last but not least we will add some melted butter and then we'll take a
spoon and give this a mix until it is very very well combined and by that I
mean every single piece of nuts and grain of sugar is coated with that
butter so keep mixing until that happens and when it does it should look a little
something like this and that's it our second component is done and we can set
that aside and move on to our wet ingredients which is going to start with
us creaming some sugar into some room temperature butter and finally for once
I remember to take my butter out ahead of time which I normally always forget
to do and then it's too hard in this step takes forever but this time it was
actually relatively soft the only problem was I picked a spatula that was
a little too flexible so it still ended up being kind of challenging to do but
anyway one of these days everything's going to come together and I'm gonna
enjoy some butter and sugar creamy nirvana but anyway if stay at it and
keep smooshing in smearin it will eventually all creamed together and
become nice and soft and relatively smooth like this
and once it does we're gonna switch to a whisk and we're gonna whip in two eggs
but we're gonna do so one at a time and that's because this mixture is mostly
fat and an egg is mostly water and as may have heard they do not like to
mix but if we do them one at a time and we wait for their first one to get mixed
in very well before adding the second they will partially emulsify as opposed
to completely separating which is probably what will happen if add
both at once and by the way at any point while you're doing this if it does look
like it is separating don't worry just keep whisking and eventually will smooth
out insure this step is easier if use an electric mixer but I don't okay
by doing this by hand I'm gonna burn off exactly the same amount of calories as
one portion of this coffee cake all right give or take about 400 calories
and besides this only takes a couple minutes but suit yourself I mean you
guys are after all the Snake Plissken of your coffee cake mix ins but the whisk
works just fine for me and then what we'll do once both eggs are incorporated
is go ahead and add some vanilla and please use the real stuff all right real
people don't use fake vanilla and then we'll also at this point add one cup of
plain yogurt and then we'll combine all this with a whisk and by the way I used
a relatively runny but beautifully tangy sheep's milk yogurt but a regular plain
Greek yogurt will work as would some sour cream and then what we'll do once
that's been mixed in is go ahead and dump in our dry ingredients which we
will stir in very carefully with our whisk and please start slowly otherwise
all that flour is gonna fly out and then what we'll do once almost but not quite
all that flours mixed in is switch to a spatula to finish this off being careful
not to over mix this okay we're just gonna need to give this a few folds and
it's totally fine if there's a little bit of flour here and there because we
still have to add our apples diced apples to be specific and how I like to
do those is by first removing the core with four cuts okay one like this and
then we'll set it down on its flat side and then three more slices right next to
the core like this which can then nibble on along with any random Apple
shards and then what we'll do is take these
four pieces and go ahead and slice them across like this and to whatever
thickness we eventually want our cubes to be which for me is going to be
somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch and yes feel free to eat any of the end
pieces and then the finishes will go ahead and stack up a few slices and then
we'll make one cut down the center before turning them and slicing across
to create some relatively consistently sized cubes and yes of course can
peel these but that's a total waste of time okay as you'll see those skins
completely disappear in the final product so I went ahead and dice two
Honeycrisp apples as shown and we will add those to our batter which we will
then finish off by carefully folding these in oh and the reason we're doing
such a small dice is because we want these to get nice and soft and tender by
the time our coffee cake is cooked and if we cut our apples too big what will
happen is our cake will be done and our two big pieces of Apple will still be
firm which will be sad and texturally inappropriate so take your time and make
them small and that's it once our batter set we'll go ahead and transfer exactly
half into a generously butter baking dish and I said exactly but just diet I
don't want measuring and then once we've transferred in half and spread it
out as evenly as we can we'll go ahead and top that with exactly half of our
crumble mixture and again just going by eye and of course we will do our best to
distribute that as evenly as we can and then once that's been accomplished we
will go ahead and spread over the rest of our batter and to make that a little
easier since we're gonna be doing it over that crumble mixture I like to
spoon over dollops like this first before we try to spread it okay that's
going to sort of give us a head start and we should be able to spread it out a
little easier without worrying that we're mixing in and messing up that
center layer of crumble and then you've probably already figured out the next
step which of course is topping this with the rest of our crumble getting it
as even as humanly possible and once that's been applied for one final step
we'll give all that a little gentle pressing down with the spoon to sort of
ever so lightly press it into the batter and that's it our apple crumble coffee
cake is now ready to transfer into the center of a 350 degree oven for about 40
minutes or so or until it looks like this and to make sure this is baked
enough we can test it by sticking a toothpick or wooden skewer into the
center and if that comes out clean it's done and if it comes out with wet
undercooked batter on and put it back in but this one was perfect
which means all we have to do is let this cool all the way down to room temp
before we slice in and serve it up and as far as the servings go I think this
would make 8 dessert sized portions or six if you're doing them as an entree
and for a first slice that actually came out pretty well all I needed was a
little bit of relatively minor crumb tuck in and then I went ahead and took a
few pictures before I tucked in and yes that coffee cup was just a
problem ok this was shot at like 5:00 p.m. which is way too late for me to
have coffee okay have to be a lot older to drink coffee at 5:00 p.m. but
anyway that my friends was just a magnificent bite a coffee cake the taste
the texture and the appearance was just perfect in every way oh and can see
any skins no neither can i nor can feel them so do not waste your time
peeling those apples not to mention we've increased the grams of fiber per
serving so now besides tasting amazing this is probably good for and right
here can get a great look at my patented layer of crumble in the center
coffee cake technique and I said patented technically is patent-pending
but anyway the point is that really is a secret to what makes this coffee cake so
great ok it's almost like we're baking a coffee cake on top of a coffee cake and
while these things are also great playing without any fruit when you
combine those beautifully sweet apples with that subtle tankiness from the
yogurt really do end up with something very special which is exactly
why this would be such a huge hit here next fancy special occasion brunch like
Mother's Day or totally casual no occasion brunch but no matter when or
why serve this I really do hope give this a try soon so please follow
