there's a new game launching into early access this week that looks pretty interesting it's called grounded it's an open world multiplayer survival adventure game on a miniature scale you and your friends have been shrunk to the size of an ant and must explore build and survive the perils of your own backyard one of the reasons i think this game might be worth keeping an eye on is its developer obsidian entertainment who are known for their work on neverwinter nights 2 alpha protocol fallout new vegas pillars of eternity the outer worlds and that's just a few of the titles that obsidian are known for point being they've got a good history of making games people really like they're also currently making avowd a first person rpg that was easily one of the main highlights of the recent xbox gaming event i think because of their fairly well established track record with making good games that leads me to believe that there's reason to be interested and grounded at the very least so i wanted to make this video to let you know everything you might want to know about the game where when and how to play it and then also give you some of my initial thoughts below so we first learned about grounded not too long ago it was back in november of last year where the game was revealed at x019 after the reveal we got a story trailer which kind of set the stage for the adventure there's this robot narrator informing us that we've been shrunk the machine that could return us to normal is broken and we must build a shelter and weapons to survive while trying to fix the machine and uncover the mystery of how we got there so so far a lot of basic stuff but we actually began getting a lot of developer vlogs which went into a bit of detail and more specifics about the game the first developer vlog just gave a basic introduction they said this is a co-op one to four player survival adventure game where you must explore build and survive you start by picking from one of four characters max willow pete and hoops and then you spawn with nothing must craft tools harvest resources build weapons and shelter kind of all the boilerplate generic survival things that you expect they mentioned that item crafting involves taking resources to this analyzer that lets you discover new recipes and some items can be craft on the go while others will require a workbench you're gonna have to set up your home base using this blueprint feature lets you map out the design before gathering resources to actually build it you can also place markers which lets you set points of interest in the world to help you navigate the yard a little more easily and then they talk about how the world is filled with tons of different insect wildlife some of which were neutral some are aggressive and if you're one of those people out there who are deathly afraid of spiders there will be an arachnophobia mode to help deal with that now in the second developer vlog we got uh kind of a few more uh fine point details about how they're trying to streamline the survival process so they mention again how you can create and place custom markers that's going to be a vital part of the experience as the map doesn't have any default markers on it the recipes in the game again are discovered through this analyzer and they will be shared with everyone in the match if you're playing a co-op map all of the armor weapons tool and tools in the game can be shared with friends as well and there will be numerous tiers of quality for all of that stuff and they talk about how there's gonna be storage units in the base they mentioned that when you die you will drop all the items but they can be recovered by uh picking up your backpack where you died spawn locations in the map are set to this lean-to that you will place in the environment and then they also touch on the fact that there is a hot pouch blueprint quick chat executable and emote radio there are radials for each one of those things and then in the last dev vlog that we got they dive a bit into the base building mentioning how you start off by unlocking this basic axe which you will then use to chop down grass for planks to build walls doors and floors and you can also chop down all sorts of of the plant life in the environment like these dandelions can be chopped down to give you these weed stems and all of these different materials will allow you to build a different quality and durability structures and it's gonna it's gonna incorporate this basic kind of 3d construction first you're actually going to place down these blueprints and then you have to bring the resources needed to actually construct that thing and all of the co-op players if you're playing with other people can see those blueprints that you place and can bring the materials to actually build it the game will also have available this creative mode that will let you focus on building without any threats and in this mode all of the game's blueprints will be available and then finally in the video they showcased a bunch of different types of bases constructed by the various members of the development team so those developer vlogs kind of gave us a nice general look at the game but we got this single player gameplay video that shows about 21 minutes of game play and really dives into a lot of the specific details um not only about like what kind of survival game and what different things you can do in grounded but also like what are some of the things that set grounded apart from other generic survival games so the video starts by showing the inside of this base with this lean 2 which again this is the spawn point and you can also rest in these to pass time if you want to go through the day and into the night period those will be done here inside of the base were also some vanity items like these chairs and uh lights there's a craft bench a couple of storage chests right outside of the base they showcase this water storage which is done in this spider web net and then throughout the base as well there's all sorts of little structures that will fulfill various roles they also spent some time talking about how there are thirst and hunger meters in the game so when you first start up you're gonna be thirsty and hungry and you're gonna have to search out for good uh food and hydration they we got a good look as well at the day night cycle in the game with the sun rising and engulfing the entire yard they showed a little bit of construction where you again you set up these blueprints in this like tile grid structure and then you have to take the resources back to the blueprints to actually build it and it's also mentioned here that your base will get attacked and you'll have to use resources to replace those damaged sections they're showed off the ability to swap it between first and third person as well and then also the fact that besides hunger and thirst there are also health and stamina meters and then doing things like chopping down chopping down plants or attacking will use up some stamina which will require of course like a balance and make sure you don't overdo things you get to explore and as you do so you're going to find all sorts of natural elements like different types of grasses mushrooms rocks and twigs but the environment is also dotted with these man-made objects so for example you might come across this juice box that you can take a sip of to get some energy and a lot of these man-made objects are also going to play into the overall story of the game which is a big element i think that's probably one of the things that they're trying to say the gra is going to set itself apart from other survival games is to focus on world building and story in this game they talk about different bugs having different characteristics so there are like these weevils where if you follow them they might lead you to mushrooms because they're attracted to mushrooms or there are aphids in the environment that will make us a good food source again as mentioned earlier there will be armor and weapons tears in this game and the armor is also gonna have different properties so there will be like tanky and damage dealer variations of armor and then besides melee weapons there will also be ranged weapons in this game we got to see a good look at a bow and arrow in action there will be the single player campaign where you follow a story but there's also that multiplayer that's more focused on the base building and the survival and that is capped at four players it's not a big multiplayer with like 50 or 100 players in a server quite a bit different from what the focus is with a lot of survival games that are out there they mentioned that the environments will be changing based on time of day and this kind of refers to the different types of insects you might find around certain ones will be more likely to come out at night and you know you see a lot of them walking around surrounded by grass uh stems and stuff but there will be all sorts of different landmarks and kind of zones in the environment so for landmarks they came across this abandoned ant hill and in doing so they also encountered this orb weaver spider which completely obliterated the character that is where they got to showcase how dying works when you die you go ahead and you spawn back onto wherever you set up your lean to and you actually drop everything you're carrying on you when you die so this requires you to go back to your body and pick up that backpack i think it's worth noting too that they teased and touched on kind of some mystical elements to this world and story i think that makes sense in general given that it's a game about being shrunk down to the size of a little insect clearly there's something magical or mystical going on here um so as you go through the single player story you have this little robot buddy which was showcased in the story trailer and he kind of helps you through the adventure and uncovering the story as to why you're here and again they then dove into the fact that obsidian is really trying to continue their overall focus as a studio on telling great stories within the game and even though that's not something you expect from a survival game necessarily that is a focus here there there is a big emphasis on the storytelling elements and then finally they uh right as at the end of the gameplay video they walked into a new zone because there are different kinds of zones in this game this zone was called the flooded zone here they discovered this marshy landmark they won't only be visually different but the zones are going to have different flora and fauna in them and then it all wraps up with another giant spider taking them out so after the gameplay video they did a q a which again gave us a bunch of really cool details about the game so i want to run through some of the more interesting questions and answers so they were asked if there's multiplayer and his response was it's just a co-op a single player or co-op adventure with one to four players there's nothing competitive you're not on a giant server again with like 50 or 100 other people it's a pretty contained experience compared to what a lot of other survival games try to do they were asked how long it's been in development and he said a little over a year and a half i think that plays also into the fact that they're launching into an early access version of this game this isn't going to be like a full-on release here uh they were asked how big the development team was and they said that it's 14 people uh it's one of the smaller development teams that obsidian has had for a game and it actually started off as a passion project and i think you can kind of see that looking at this game it seems i'm not surprised i guess that they're it's a fairly small development team working on this title they were asked if the game has an ecosystem the response was yes it's a huge world with hundreds of insects that have their own behaviors as an example ants will hunt for food to bring back to the ant hill and if you start hoarding food at your base the ants will notice that your base is a good source of food and so they might try to break in and get it and there's also predators in the game and they will have like different hunting patterns as for the kind of prey that they tend to go after will there be tool and weapon degradation yes there is both weapons and tools will have durability they will wear away and need to be repaired or just straight up recrafted and they're still kind of working on the details of this based on player feedback asked about a hardcore mode he said that there are different difficulty options with the harder very versions ramping up combat as well as survival challenges and the team is also talking about eventually adding this extra hard mode but no specific details there up they were here this is a really important point here when asked if anything was randomized versus handcrafted evidently the entire world is hand crafted there will be elements that are randomized such as the creature behavior the entire backyard is one handcrafted experience the location of things and all of that is structured it is one particular thing it is not randomized or procedurally generated and i think that's a important element that i'll touch on later here they were asked about character creation and the response to this was no there is none there are the four default characters in the game that you can pick from and they have their own unique personalities which is tied into the story and the game world and customization will basically solely come through weapons and armor it was asked about base restrictions to which she said you can build any size base that you want it can be as massive or as small as you want although there will be some cap on height as to how tall of a base that you can build so i think with that gameplay video this really gives us a clear picture of what what ground it is and the kind of scope and scale that it's going to have now again as a reminder this thing is launching into early access and they have a few details as to why and what that means why are they in early access basically they say that from their previous experience in crowdfunding they find a lot of value in involving the community in the development process and so that's how they would like to approach approach grounded as well where they get the game out there in a playable state with a decent amount of features to let the development flow with kind of what the community is looking for in terms of how long it's going to be in early access they say that they are targeting a full release at some point in 2021 now what about what the game will have in the early access version so in the early access version when it comes out tomorrow it's gonna have the groundwork laid for their intended storyline there will be three major biomes the grasslands hedge and haze it's gonna have crafting base building single player and online co-op the first two tiers of weapons and armor at least 10 different insects as well as the arachnophobia mode and just looking at that list feels pretty limited pretty restricted with only two tiers of r i mean i'm not just going to read this whole thing again but yeah that's that seems like it's a small a relatively small scale in scope and i'm going to be very curious kind of how much time and um and just how much game there is to be enjoyed when this thing comes out tomorrow now how is this early access version gonna differ from the full version well they say with the full version they're gonna complete the storyline they're gonna add steve steam achievements and cards there will be more bugs uh more environments and biomes besides the three that we're getting now more crafting recipes as well as additional features and updated systems to improve the entire experience uh the price will go up as well over time this is pretty common place for early access it starts cheap the cheapest and then gets progressively more expensive leading up to the full release so with all that information here here are some of my first thoughts i i think that they're gonna have to be very careful um the fact that there's no competitive elements and it's only a co-op and single-player experience that is quite a bit different from what a lot of people look for out of the survival game genre so i think when it comes to like a lot of the people who like the hardcore steam early access survival games of which there are probably hundreds at this point right you know of like the dayz variety things like that they're not gonna like this game at all i don't think i don't think there's gonna be any appeal for that audience i think it's pretty clear that this game is trying to reach a different possibly younger audience just with the general style and setting um but again this is obsidian and they've mentioned numerous times in all of the talks and videos about the game how they are gonna have a big focus on the story so there that's a question how long is that story campaign going to be i'm curious if there's going to be any big challenges like boss creatures you know we've seen some big spiders but there's a lot that they could do in this world where you are the size of an insect like imagine a dog boss well i guess you don't want to be attacking a dog i don't know there's ideas you know there's things that there's a giant rat how about that what about a giant rat that you have to fight i just throwing out throwing spitballing here but yeah are there going to be any massive challenges or is it just going to be the basic loop of you fight insects you gather grass and twigs and stuff and you build a base in armor um are there any kind of big difficult goals to work towards um that also ties into how's the long-term progression how interesting are those gear tiers things to keep player and players engaged beyond that main story and i'm also very curious about besides the fact that there's like no competition here it's a single-player co-op only like the replay ability with the static world with not a procedurally generated landscape that changes every time you make a new backyard or whatever it's always going to look the same the layout's going to be the same the points of interest are going to be the same every time you play this game how is that going to affect the replayability again it's a game from obsidian obsidian has a great track record they've made some fantastic games i think that in of itself is enough of a reason to at least want to give this game a look it's it's a lot different and it's clearly trying to target a different audience than the standard survival experience but i still think that there could be some interesting stuff here i think it really comes down to um how much there is to do and what the long-term progression looks like but there you go that is a look at grounded hope you guys enjoyed the video and yeah i'll check it out tomorrow and um if i think it's worth it i'll i'll make a follow-up alright thanks for watching guys until next time i'll see you later
