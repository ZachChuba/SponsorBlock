welcome back to new rock stars I'm Erik Bosse this is Phillip Molina and to meet you this yeah we're remitting you every time because you have to be a new watcher and welcome if you are this is a big question folks this is a show where we dive deep into the real nerdy questions very mature serious adults grown-up questions like space Hitler's sexual history and that's this week's why should I send you this I forgot it's your fault and spoiler warning for the rise of Skywalker by the way you've had some time and if you're one of the great viewers who watches the show with your kids we love that you watch new rock spurs videos with your kids that you bring the family in but this might be an episode that you might want to just play in the background cuz we still get the the view metric but Adam watch let the boy watch sir you party watch learn this is how I learned how these things work as I watched the the late 90s version of YouTube which was a bombs world or home movies that I stole for my neighbor and fuzzy pay-per-view yeah oh oh yeah geez sexy we got some booze in the mugs and who knows when I'll get when I'll kick in it already has started but we'll answer some other smaller questions later Phillips got some gear that he did some homework get out of here okay okay I'm just so excited to see but what is there a big question this week Philip okay a lot of people saw Roger Scott Walker and it was a film and in this film we find out a certain thing about a certain temper it turns out that Palpatine he [ __ ] yeah he did apparently I want to know everything I want to know how he [ __ ] I want to know when he [ __ ] I want to know why I want to know who okay I want to know how much a very artful way of asking who is Ray's grandmother but the u.s. that is not what I'm saying you did school up but I want to know how she [ __ ] okay all right I'll get to some of those questioned out Palpatine had a son that son is named only as Ray's father we never even learned his name from the credits of the rise of Skywalker he's played by actor Billy Howell we also can probably determine that Palpatine son is not a clone even the cloning does exist and in the expanded universe and legend stories Palpatine does clone himself this dude is probably not a clone because one he doesn't look anything like Ian McDiarmid and you think they try to make him look with Oh face behind me for the first time the other reason we know that Papa teen son is probably not a clone it's because rises Skywalker kind of showed us what Palpatine clones look like the way he resurrects is partly by cloning and that Palpatine is gooey and so is this one this one so are a couple Palpatine's we'll find out this episode so I got my answer he do it gooey he did it the old-fashioned way the gooey way is how he had a kid so by using raised age which we know and by estimating the father actor's age we can kind of get a window of when Palpatine probably conceived when he smushed and by knowing that historical period we can look around at the people in Palpatine's orbit to figure out who his partner could have been because we don't think it was a one-off like one-night-stand it could have been but if it's gonna be someone we can narrow it down to a couple options so let's do the math by galaxy there's a fertile yeah well if you think if you're Palpatine you're not just gonna [ __ ] anyone you're gonna you're gonna see so when you can trust it's got way darker than I thought it even just Rey was born in the year fifteen ABY and that makes her nineteen when the force awakens occurs that occurs in 34 ABY and just in case you're not sure about this ABY and BBY are kind of the Star Wars equivalents of BC and AD right before the Battle of Yavin and after the Battle of Yavin now actually in the rise of Skywalker visual dictionary they came up with a new way to determine this setting the Year Zero at the Starkiller base destruction of the hosnian system which to be fair is a much bigger historical event but we're gonna stick with BBY ABY that's the one that most Star Wars lovers know and love so Rey's parents left her on jakku when she was six years old so that would be at 21 ABY and that is also the year her parents died because we learned a Verizon Skywalker after they left jakku that's when hochi caught up with them and killed him and that's the same when we see actor Billy Howell who is aged 29 years when he shot that that scene 29 years now so probably it would be 28 years whenever he shot that scene in Star Wars years Ray's father would have been born in the year 7 BBY but that's if he was 29 so probably we're looking around 6 BBY or might have been conceived actually year earlier so we're back to 7 BBY what was going on in the year 7 BBY in Star Wars history well this is about halfway through the Emperor's take over with oldest 66 and still strengthening his control over the galaxy the Death Star is almost done being built he's probably at the height of his power but he was you know disfigured I was gonna say he cute or no no he's this this is this is after mace windu melted of you he won't you know from a certain point of view but he'd be around 72 years old he was born in the Year 84 BBY so at 72 years old that's just around the time you want to start having kids I guess I mean Larry King I looked this up the oldest man to ever father a child was named les Kali of Australia he had his ninth child a son at the age 92 oh poor woman oh my god there was a third wife yeah a 92 year old wiener well human males are able to conceive children at that age obviously but after the age of 30 male testosterone drops one to two percent each year some guys some of those just keeps getting higher DNA integrity declines it makes fertility less likely yeah is like your DNA hey but here's some good news look forward to the testicles don't reduce in size until after age 80 so it's 72 years old got some big ripe plums on this guy 70 at 80 they start to get smaller yeah and that does affect fertility exercise your nuts they were like the same some elderly inmates are getting their nuts checked every gosh does this apply to Papa Dean because he is a very powerful force practitioner in normal physics and biology doesn't apply to that body you can imagine his swimmers like Luke and the Death Star trench just using the force to find their way to that egg and blow it up the targeting computer you but one thing I did find in my research is that male fertility can be affected by bodily harm in radiation which that was deflected said lightning that caused that so yeah yes so they got they they might have gotten fried like they look like that to his nuts don't have an unlimited power they're super smooth those balls are smooth as eggs now some people are saying that Palpatine could use his Darkseid abilities to conceive a child via midi-chlorian magic or whatever so you wouldn't have to have intercourse the boring version of having a kid there is that whole not firmly Canon back story of how Anakin was conceived in SHINee's would they have since said the writers of that are saying that they don't want people to think that means that he created Anakin right I don't know what else it could mean but yeah I mean it was it was kind of in the comics and there was like a draft of George Lucas's script for Revenge of the Sith were Palpatine tells him this so to me that seems more Canon than not but he didn't put his own DNA in Smith he disease need and father a child he just kind of like manipulated reality to have this thing be immaculate so why would he do it that way once and then a different time later do it the old-fashioned way I think that's what they're saying that the whole Shmi story isn't canon and the only time he has fathered a child was the father of Rey now we have also recently learned that force healing is canon in the star wars universe so if you did have a wreck tile dysfunction he couldn't know you could just force heal oh my god so that says everything your dearly every time we masturbate on this portal in our own tener they go from flaccid to Iraq's airing and then life finds a way I always like to be there when the boy did break sooner so you think he might be suffering from edie or something right at that age it's very hints calm it's available for not as yet yeah you're saying at that age he could be suffering from Edie uh-huh and then you just glanced over that I think you're implying that he used SIF powers to undo his Edie mhm I think we have to assume maybe at age 72 he must've slayed some puss you can say cuz Marina said it first that's right she said it was fine he has you know a mushy noodle it looks like that yeah and you're saying he needed to make it all dentist somehow he was able to get to al dente and you're saying oh because you're saying in a galaxy far far away they don't have viagra yes that's what I'm saying so but they probably have something better than viagra swill sit lightning force healings so he uses force healing on himself yes now another dimension of this question is as a Sith would Palpatine be allowed to because the Jedi don't allow you to take romantic partners to the Sith have the same rules it's not clear there's some debate online but unlike the Jedi the Sith are not bound to the same dogmatic rules they are they always go rogue that's their whole identity but they probably would not want to I mean Palpatine manipulated Anakin to pursue love because that made him more vulnerable to control most Sith would probably not want any attachment they're loners they don't want friends on attachment it doesn't mean you don't slay but they can't be vulnerable right so you're saying they but Darth Maul double dong inch I mean even a momentary moment of orgasm would be enough of a blackout to have a city boner like I wake up a month later in a hospital bed that's life begins and ends in a hospital okay so did Palpatine ever have a partner in the legend stories or in Canon well in the comics and the literary material puppet II was a bit of a player he had a harem he had concubine harem a Herriman has been described one of the concubines was named ro ganda is Marin she was a former Jedi youngling who was kidnapped by the empire and used her force powers to infiltrate the imperial court and she had a child with another imperial leader to try to pass off the kid as Palpatine's legitimate heir it didn't work there was also another woman in Palpatine's orbit named listen is hard and she was the director of Imperial Intelligence she's a badass she tortured people in a prison underneath course hunt and she briefly ruled the Empire after the Emperor's death in the Battle of Endor but neither of these women are canon in the live-action universe yet one woman is who was innocent or 'but and i think is the most likely option to be in love her and raise grandmother sly more you may remember her she's the bald female and baron who's seen beside Palpatine in attack of the clones she was like part of his like guard you know she's a senior administrative aide she was one of the few people who knew that Palpatine had a dual identity as Darth Sidious she knew about all this and she was force sensitive she used her mind-control powers to blackmail her successor to get into his inner circle and in the literary material there were actually tabloid rumors that sly and Palpatine were having an affair and she disappeared and it was believed that she gave birth to a son who is the legends character named Triclops [Laughter] really nineties Jedi Prince books this is just what there's a lot of goofy story to eyes but he just had one monocle so they could American clubs named by bullies clubs is not canon but slime or has been in the movies the characters there we don't know what happened to her her force sensitivity sensitivity plus her knowledge of Palpatine Sith identity plus the timeline this period to me makes her the most likely candidate to be raised grandmother but that's among characters that we know about the other likelihood is that there's just some other woman that he met and he had this baby with and we may never know her name or Lucasfilm may just like say this was her name this is what happened let's move on this is a story of it it's also just possible that he fathered dozens of kids all over the galaxy like ego the Living Planet you know he hooked up with every life-form he could and that could be something you could imagine Palpatine wanting that or he could imagine him being afraid to trust just strangers and only wanting to father a child with someone who is very close to him like slime or some high bright we talked about this before and I had brought up Kiera from solo that was a nearly Clarke's character she did have connections to Maul in the dark side many of speculate she could have been raised mother remember not a grandmother she was born in the year 31 BBY that would have made her 24 at the time type 24 and 72 that is three times older your age once again Larry Kane and this is this is not a tight 72 like old cap was this is a very loose 72 look if you had to ask me if it was someone that we know currently from the Star Wars universe slime or seems like the most likely candidate he could have taken as a lover or someone some stranger that we may never know so that's who he thought and when he fought a seven BBY seven BBY huh and how he fought for Seeley I hate this I'm so happy that we answered this question philip has an interesting question he's gonna answer for us after may apply just visit our B in HD CEO slash speeds and we are back and now we're gonna move on I can't believe you guys came back I cannot believe you stay with you we're gonna some bite-sized questions but Billups got one big bite so Phillip this question was submitted by at baby once a Jeep how do you how do Wolverine baby needs a Jeep how do Wolverines claws work when his wrists are bent so imagine that just bent wrist that risk but the claws go up into your wrist so in your own you get out of my question okay at first it's kind of like why is this a problem he like he can bend his wrist right right no this is so much more complicated I created a very accurate representation you created yeah all by yourself I stay up all night doing this Alexi helped okay he helped Wolverine he goes like like you come come they retract ya come at me Museum metal because I magneto coming at you yeah and he's like ah you got real close yeah try it again I gotta go on to you what happened of afraid to so that's like Wolverine story now you guys know what will Prince like here's the issue does he have to be careful about his risk yes he actually always has to when they draw him into comics he has to come be coming at someone with his wrist perfectly straight in his hand straight so flash witless you can't do one of these it has to go straight you can't becoming like with with a punch or a hook and it gets really complicated actually as to how it works alright so the reason is if his claws are stored in his forearm which it is in various forms of like x-rays that they release and also movies and stuff yeah they they can show it actually there's different versions where it sometimes is on top of his other bones sometimes it's between them his own ends radius and then it pushes through the meta carsales and we really moves the bones out of the way so it can shoot out of roughly where the knuckles are so here's the issue he started to extend his claws but his wrist is bent then the claws can't bend to so they would shoot out of the wrong part so if I were to bend this see now where these claws are theoretically coming out of is out of my wrist yeah up here yeah instead of out of where my knuckles are or if I went this way I can't do it because I'll actually have to pierce my own hand yeah come throw your home and they actually showed this there's a time there's two times very interesting one Wolverine got really drunk once out of nowhere has he had like basically space liquor and it actually affected him which it almost never does cuz of his healing powers and so he gets so drunk that he forgets to straighten his hand and it shoots out of his palm all three claws and he's like whoops and he looks like realistic but another time in the age of apocalypse story you can catch up [Laughter] he gets his gets his hand well I think it's like melted off by Cyclops not Triclops the and he has no hand and so he's fighting and people are like oh so he doesn't have claws no you stupid idiot i stuff the claws in the form and he shoots the claws out of just the stump oh but it works pretty cool yeah it's very cool here's what's so confusing about like the physics of all this okay if he were to bend his wrist later also a problem I'm pushing the claws all the way through uh-huh right that's like as far out as they go so now they've left his forearm and they're theoretically just in his hands now now come at me okay don't stop me you have short pencils when I use these noodles al dente is fine trust me I trust you uh you don't get injured me you don't I don't want to break it but well yeah I don't have another sharpener so if it goes up and he goes ah and he all the claws all the way out to the knuckles they would snap off when he goes to actually try to pierce my hurry because there's there's no the leverage is all the way on the outside and they're barely hanging on by these little baby nuts here okay yes so then this means okay his claws must be a lot longer than right they still have a significant portion of the club when it's out what are you trying to do you'll see okay so there are a lot longer claws you say Eric Eric take her away No so you're like oh the claws are a lot longer and covered in saliva so then this is how they stay in right that does make sense for when you push them out first like like now come at me come on donate okay so if it goes I get it in my forearm is much large the amount of claws that go back here is a lot longer it can push out and it's still strong so if I if you if you came at me it wouldn't break I have all this power but the problem is when I reverse extend retract and go back it literally in your elbow yeah so he would have to walk around like you do sometimes comfortable or like the woman who never moves her arms in Seinfeld yeah exactly so he wouldn't be able to bend his arms for that to work so immediately this character is like so deeply flawed his claws cannot work I have an answer as to how his claws actually have to work it's like the only way that this makes sense one is yes they do have to be a little longer than what he sticks out there okay okay it's not fully extended there is still amounts left up into his former home but it's a very precise amount that's actually the length of his forearm because his claws are part of his mutant abilities and not what was given to him what they had mentally they were bone claws they're bone claws then they would naturally just kind of be almost a replicant of his own arse radius so they're just the right length where they're exactly the length of his forearm and then they extend a few inches out but any artists that over extends them and shows which they do all the time they show these like multi footlong katanas they're compensating for something mm-hmm Liefeld designs yeah exactly because he doesn't even need them to be that it's unrealistic their swords at that point he basically just wants them to be about finger length knives or or even like maybe six inches out like four inches still inside which is roughly the you know a 10 size 10 shoe means you have a 10 inch forearm do you know that your foot is the size of your forearm hold on look now people know I'm wearing shorts you've been trying to hide that for years how about to rip something so doing he's got clothes that are exactly the size of his forearm a significant portion of it still stays inside his form it does not stick out that far everyone else is just exaggerating this is a really key part look at his costume design look at the gloves and look at the little metal shades that they included little righties oh the scenes that go right over each blade they're actually directly to address the come at me problem with his snap off they hold him in place but and here's my proposition he must internally have his own bone version of those shades in there that's also anchoring them so that the leverage problem doesn't happen where they just fall out Wolverine got bone seeds yes and if you look in a very classic design x-ray design it looks like they kind of attempted to squeeze that in really quick they put these little circles there and they didn't really like acknowledge them but that has to be it so he has little bone holes in there that hold the claws in place and then partially it's up there and it's exactly the length of his forearm it's the only thing that makes I love it now what if they retract like lightsaber toys where they they fold bolt and then fold yeah could I do that like a human penis so really you only need this much space and in here that it could work yeah so they don't and now they know I know where start open just try to get you to show your legs how's your bite size in the last episode of hey we have time for one the fan mail question right send them your fan mail at the post office box address listed below this one is sentient by snacky Zack who asked what are your new year's resolutions and have you broken them yet oh man mine was to drink less well my new year's resolution was to learn how to shuffle a
