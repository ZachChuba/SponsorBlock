hello this is chef john from food wishes
calm with bob's kabobs that's right there once was a man named bob who
showed me how to make this kebab he wasn't the chef the chef's name was
Jeff but still he did a great job and while I'm not able to tell you too much
about Bob due to some very strict non-disclosure agreements I am very
excited and very happy to be able to share this recipe and now the grilling
season is upon us this is definitely something you're gonna want to work into
the rotation so with that let's go ahead and get started by mixing up our spice
blend which is going to start with some ground cumin a little bit of coriander
some Aleppo chili flakes a generous amount of kosher salt as well as of
course a little shake of cayenne and then last but not least Bob secret
ingredients a very small pinch of cinnamon okay if you can taste the
cinnamon you put too much but just a little tiny hint in the background
really works well here and then what we're gonna do after we give this a mix
is use our spoon to push off about 1/3 of the mixture to the side and the
reason for that is we're gonna use 2/3 to season the meat and then the other
third will get sprinkled on the outside before our kebabs get grilled ok so once
we have that separated we'll go ahead and take a pound of ground meat in my
case lamb but you can also use beef or a combination of both which is very nice
and like I said we'll go ahead and transfer over 2/3 of our spice mix along
with 2 tablespoons of very cold fresh water and that's it once we drizzle that
in we'll take one clean hand and we will mix and match this until it's thoroughly
combined and this is one of the few times when
we're mixing ground meat where we don't really have to worry about overworking
it too much since traditionally once cooked the
meats supposed to have a little bit of a springy texture okay not tough but
slightly springy and that's partly the reason we added some water to this which
of course is also gonna add a little bit of extra juiciness and that's it once
that's very thoroughly mixed we'll go ahead and cover that in plastic and
we'll pop that in the fridge for about an hour or so or until it's nicely
chilled ok cold meat is always easier to handle in shape plus it will give those
spices some time to work their magic oh and while that's happening let's not
forget to soak our wooden skewers in some water so they don't burn up on the
grill and then what we'll do once those are
soaked for about an hour and our meat mixture is nice and cold we will go
ahead and pull that out and then take 1/8 of the mixture and we will roll that
2 ounce portion into a nice ball after wetting our fingers with some of that
water we use the soak these skiers because as you know damp hands make
smooth balls and then once we have that into a nice smooth ball we'll kind of
shape it into an oval and then skewer it making sure we go right through the
center and then what we'll do once we have that squeezed out to about 3 inches
or so we will also want to kind of taper both ends down to a point which is not
only gonna help this stay attached to this gear it's also gonna make it look
supercool an enticing okay as you may have heard me say before it is a proven
scientific fact that people love pointy food and that's it exactly how Bob
formed his kabobs and while most people think of chunks of meat on a skewer when
they hear kebab here I'm going to show you the other style of kebab sometimes
referred to as kofta or kofte or Coupe de the features ground meat and while
both versions are great this is the style that Bob and I prefer but anyway I
went ahead and formed the rest to make a total at which point I do like to wrap
them and chill them again although if you wind you could cook these right away
but personally I like these very cold before I cook them plus it's always
easier to have things prepped ahead of time and while those were chillaxing in
the fridge I went ahead mixed up a quick yogurt sauce which was simply some plain
Greek yogurt some very finely crushed garlic a little bit of freshly chopped
parsley as well as some freshly squeezed lemon juice and then enough fresh cold
water to thin this out to the exact consistency we want and once all that's
in there we'll go ahead and give it a mix and yes this would have been way
faster and easier with a whisk but the spoon was already dirty from scooping in
the yogurt and I remember Bob used to always say the already dirty utensil is
always better than the more effective clean utensil so it took me an extra
minute or so but eventually I got that all stirred together nice and smooth and
know I didn't add any salt because our meats gonna be very well seasoned so we
should be ok and we can refrigerate that until needed and then you remember that
third of the seasonings we saved if we can find it we're gonna go ahead and add
a spoon of sumac to this and if he can't find it don't stress but if he can't add
it in as it does add a very interesting sort of
tangy citrus like flavor and then what we'll do on SATs next is pull our Bob's
kebabs out of the fridge and we're gonna season those all over with the rest of
our spice mixture and while you're doing this if you want to do a little bit of
fine tuning with the shaping feel free oh and I should mention a lot of the
kebab recipes will actually have you add the sumac to the meat mixture but Bob
was a big believer of only putting it on the outside but anyway suit yourself
I mean you are after all the Robert Duvall's of these impaled meatballs but
if I'm making somebody call Bob's kebabs I am gonna kebab like Bob and he thought
it was better with this just on the outside and that's it once these are sad
we can go ahead and cook them up which I'm gonna do by grilling them over some
beautiful japanese-style charcoal and well of course any kind of grill would
work these narrow hibachi style grills are perfect for skewered meat but in any
event I'm gonna grill these for about 10 to 12 minutes total turning these about
every 3 minutes or so so that hopefully the entire surface faces the heat and as
far as done this goes you could use a thermometer and cook these to about 135
internal temp but for me when they go from feeling kind of mushy to feeling
kind of firm and springy they're usually done and like I said these took me about
12 minutes all together and that's it once I felt those were done both
physically and mentally I removed those to plate and headed back inside where I
serve those up on a beautiful platter of tomatoes cucumbers and red onions did I
dress very lightly with some salt and some olive oil and after arranging those
as shown I went ahead and scattered over some more freshly chopped parsley and
yes brushing off some parsley does count as food styling I also dusted over some
more sumac since that is going to be really good with those vegetables
underneath and of course we're also gonna want some grilled pita bread
nearby and then I went ahead and finished this up by spooning a little
bit of that yogurt sauce over the top which I thought would look nice for the
pictures especially garnish with one last sprinkling of sumac and that's it
this beautiful batch of Bob's kebabs is done and ready to enjoy and for this
first one I'm just gonna enjoy it as is right off the skier and that my friends
was just incredible ok I think Bob would have been very proud just an incredibly
flavorful bite of meat perfectly seasoned inside and out
and there's just something about lamb spice this way that when you combine it
with the smokiness from the grill just elevates this to a whole other level and
please stop looking at that parsley on my thumb and while very delicious plain
what you really want to do is nestled this into some nice warm pita along with
some of those nice cool crisp fresh veggies and of course lots of our
garlicky lemony yogurt sauce and if there's a better thing to eat especially
in the middle of grilling season I just can't think of it right now
and as I mentioned earlier well I prefer this done with lamb it's also really
good done with beef or a combination of half-and-half which by the way Bob was a
big fan of he used to say why choose when you can have both but anyway that's
it had a kebab like Bob I only wish he was around to see this and not in the
witness protection program where I'm not able to get him a message but anyway
hopefully somehow he stumbles across this and if he did I think he'd say the
same thing I'm gonna say now which is I really do hope you give this a try soon
