months of Skillshare for free back in 2007 vinyl was nearly a dead medium it was consigned to the most indy corners of the world aficionados and collectors thumbing through dusty old crates one such collector was a man named John Murphy one day Murphy was shopping for vinyl in a store in Edmonton when he found an album that caught his eye the artwork was simple a dreamy man on a white background the album was called la mujer and performed by a man known only as Louis Murphy bought the album for $1 and in doing so kicked off one of the strangest mysteries in modern music let's take a closer look the Lewis LP II offered little information about its creator but it did place the album temporally l'amour was released in 1983 in some ways this comes together all too clearly in the music the whole album is laying atop a soft bed of synthesizers but the sound of these synthesizers isn't when you tend to think of when you place yourself in the mid 80s instead of flashy and over-the-top Lewis's synthesizers are nuanced more ambient than anything else in most places you can hear this on even rainbows turn blue where they provide light atmosphere behind a twangy guitar another of the album's signatures [Music] on things just happen that way the synth seem nearly entirely disconnected from Lewis's odd piano music the album credits a man named Philip leaves with creating the signature synth sound that is omnipresent on l'amour one of the draws of the album is the way that atmosphere sits over almost all of the music it's calm strange and fragmented Lewis finds a mood at the beginning of I thought the world of you and Susan it until the end of romance 4 - it's a mood that seems to be looking back to the despairing folk of Nick Drake with more than a touch of Bryan Ferry and Roxy music but more captivating is the way it looks forward it seems like it would fit next to the ambient melancholy of contemporary bands like the antlers this detached other worldliness begs a thousand questions questions that aren't answered much by the lyrics Lucis singing is slurred and incoherent yet beautiful when you do pick up words or phrases they seem to paint pictures of small intimate moments of romance or the forlorn feeling of those moments lost in keeping with the title nearly every song on the album seems to be about love in its own broken way it seems utterly unbelievable that something like this came out of the drug fueled scenes of Los Angeles in the 1980s the disjointed nature of the songs the mumbled inaudible lyrics and the haunting beauty of it all was enough to set Murphy and his friend Aaron Levin on a journey to find out just who Lewis was the album's package gave a few clues namely that the copyright holder was a man named Randall Wolfe another detail was the photographer who took the album's cover photo ed cover Lewis is a strange footnote in the career of Culver who got acclaim for documenting the West Coast punk scene of the 80s some of Culver's photos even became the cover of a few punk albums including Black Flag's damage and bad religions how could he'll be any worse among others but Colvin remembered his shoot with Randall Wolfe the man known as Lewis Wolfe showed up to the shoot driving a white Mercedes convertible with a beautiful woman in his arms he paid culver with a $250 check but when the photographer went to cash it the check bounced the story of who wolf was seems incongruent with the vulnerable misty beauty of Louis's music but it does go in line with another one of the album's mini eccentricities the track romance for two was dedicated to the famous Sports Illustrated model christine brinkley all of these details create a fuzzy picture of who Lewis might be but so much remains a mystery when Levin uploaded some of Louis's songs onto the blog weird Canada in 2012 the Internet began to speculate as to who exactly this man could be some thought perhaps he was an extraterrestrial visitor come down for a brief moment to gaze at us with piercing eyes and share his ethereal musics for others he's a jet-setting Playboy bouncing around the world stopping briefly to record a beautiful album others yet have him as a criminal and a con man an elusive musical DB Cooper of sorts and through these theories more details about Lewis have come out Murphy and Levin got in touch with Randall Wolf's nephew who said that he had been a stockbroker and recorded more music in Europe legend had it that wolf lived in an apartment full of all-white furniture it even came out that he might have recorded some unreleased religious music in Vancouver later in his career as collectors were searching for their own copies of lamb or a few stumbled upon the jackpot a second Lewis album this time his name is scrawled in the cover as Lewis Balu and he poses a next to a private jet and the white convertible Mercedes described by Culver the second album is called romantic times and it opens on a crooning love tune that seems to quote strangers in the night [Music] as a whole romantic times is less a fury it's got a bigger more developed sound than la more with saxophones and electric drums romantic times has become an even rarer collector's item with only a handful of original copies ever found it's so rare in fact that a copy sold on eBay for $1,800 in 2014 all this brought new attention to Luis and with it a reissue of his records by the label light in the Attic and even though he's been brought into the spotlight we still know painfully little about the man named Luis apparently most of his family has settled in British Columbia but he remains estranged from them letting the Attic has said they're holding the royalties for Luis but so far he has yet to come forth and claim them and maybe it's better that way maybe Luis works better as a specter as a mystery as someone that we will never truly know all about and Louis's story is more than just a great mystery it's a reminder of the countless unheard pieces of greatness out there today it's a reminder that somewhere in the back corner of a record store sitting in a dusty milk crate is the next unknown masterpiece just waiting for you to find it so now you're feeling inspired to go and teach yourself something new [Music]
