[Music] hello everybody I've come to the Isle of Eric off the west coast of Scotland for a whirlwind tour to grab some coffee some really good landscape photography some people photographically call this place Scotland in miniature because it's got everything from mountains waterfalls woodland wildlife so I'm just hoping to capture a small portion of that get some really good pictures before we get into your next move with Squarespace right let's go [Music] we are straight into it this morning I'm just really starting off with a very simple composition to get this mountain behind me here this is the main biggest mountain on the island and it's called Goat fell this is actually the first time I've seen it's been shrouded in cloud the entire time that I've been here so far so I've got up especially this morning in the hope that I was going to see it and catch a bit of a sunrise the Sun is actually setting or so rising over here I'm hoping that the Sun is gonna catch on goal fell itself but the weather's been so changeable that there's a good chance that that is not going to happen so I've started off with just a such a straightforward composition because I want to capture that mountain and it's all its glory before it disappears so I've got the 17 to 200 lens on there I'm actually out at 70 millimetres and it's just gonna be so straightforward it's just got a tiny bit of the C in there then we're just going up to go felt with those really quite interesting clouds behind at the moment to try and introduce a little bit more interest though I am going to do a long exposure and I've already taken my test setting which is f11 that's I could have got a face to get maximum shop without the lenses but I've gone for f11 because I want to just increase that exposure time a little bit an ISO 100 and then 1/4 of a second for the current lighting conditions to get the exposure right I've got the 10 stop filter already on the front of the lens and with that at f11 it means I have an exposure time of about 2 minutes 2 minutes 8 seconds to be precise there's nothing complicated about this shot whatsoever it's just a really nice sort of starts of the day I'm walking distance from where I'm staying the so much cloud around I'm not sure I'm gonna get it now it's raining a bit actually over the mountain now I'm already focused in just on the mountain so let's turn on the vault timer 2 minutes 8 seconds 2 second time to get it going and I wait 2 minutes and see how that turns out [Music] [Applause] well I know I'm in Scotland already because it's hailing it's raining there's nothing dull nothing dull it's all about coming to Scotland one thing I was fine as well with being in Scotland is just how much more isolated and out-of-the-way the great outdoors feels now our Ahrens not a big place so I'm not that far away from civilization but it always just feels that way partly it's because of the landscape partly it's because there's much fewer people around than there is in the other parts of the UK Scotland is huge but there's not that many people that live there so about as many people live in London as there isn't Scotland you also get just in the middle of winter you get these massive leaves look at the size of these its these massive leaves that kind of feel prehistoric and the landscape just feels much more untouched by man than it does elsewhere and we are only in Scotland so it's not wilderness or anything it is affected by man but just far fewer people and I like that it sometimes makes it tougher it also makes it more of an adventure and more exciting so hopefully I can find a landscape photograph to do that kind of feeling some justice it's really pretty heavy though so I'm gonna put my rank on yes another example is the pine forests that you get in the highlands and in certain parts of Scotland they're just so dense and nothing like you get anywhere else in the UK they're absolutely huge but just look how dark this one is behind me it's so dense and so dark even right in the middle of the day it's about one o'clock at the moment that's the brightness of the sky and then we spin around this way just total darkness it's absolutely incredible I'm not particularly a woodland photographer so I'm not going to even attempt to make something of it but I do love the woods I grew up in the woods playing in the woods some fascinated by them and these pine forests are just incredible absolutely incredible [Music] okay so the hike out into this Glen has just been absolutely worth it because just look at this stunning scene behind me I've stumbled across this waterfall and it's just so impressive it's so impressive and it's just absolutely beautiful is it sort of snakes its way up to goat fell in the distance there and my goodness are those mountains looking extraordinary as well it's such a striking Mountain anyway because it's very direct triangular shape and then you've got some of those crags over to the right-hand side of it as well just adding a lot of drama to this scene it also rained really heavily overnight and I think some of that must have fallen is a bit of snow or some of its turn to ice on top of the fells because it's just looking beautiful with just that little sprinkling of white on the top of those fells pretty much that's the sort of mood and the style I want to capture it's exceptionally windy so I'm having to keep my back turned to the wind so you can hear me and also the noise of the waterfall is very very impressive as well I'm playing around with a few compositions so far and I've settled a lot of probably experiments a bit more but I've settled for the moment on a vertical shots because I'm really like this large stone or massive stone here which has some part of the water coming down it the main part of the waterfall is then just here and that kind of winds its way up several little Falls then it goes a bit flatter before we go up to go fell in the distance I just really like the curve of the stream here so I've gone for a relatively wide angle I'm at 35 millimetres on the vertical and this pull here at the bottom starts down in the left-hand side of the image and then it just works its way around and up through that waterfall reach strong foreground interest and then it works its way up to go fell in the distance there which is intermittently being covered in cloud it's covered in cloud at the moment so I will capture it like that let's just do that now because I'm all set but it also I'm hoping that it will clear again it was clear when I first got here I hope it does clear up so I can get it both ways but having it shrouded in cloud could be really interesting but I do also want to capture it without the cloud and then see which is best so for this shot fenders turn into the wind for a minute I want to smooth out that water a little bit I've tried it without and I just don't like the frozen waterfall look so I've gone for the six stop filter just so I can still compose through the live view what that will also do is with that cloud that is around at the top of the felt you'll just smooth that out a little bit and add a slightly ethereal feel to it as well as in the wash I'm going to turn my cranks out wall it's quite noisy settings wise with that six stop filter on I'm at f11 that's enough to get sharpness from back to front in this case because I'm not too close to that foreground and that's giving me ISO 100 a shutter speed of 8 seconds which is perfect for smoothing out that water and providing a little bit of movement in that cloud because it is moving really really quickly so I've got the two second timer on I'm composed I'm really happy with the composition that cloud is moving around so beautiful bears I'm gonna capture it again two second timer there we go eight seconds later we'll have a shot but I'll have a little play around I will get probably get down here actually and shoot it a little bit closer get a sort of horizontal shot as well just because I'm here so I might as well but I'm not sure which I'm gonna like best I can't talk you through that one because it just can be too noisy down there but I put both images of for you to see now you [Music] nice I've just rushed across the island got back down from the mountains and made it to the coast again the beach just in time to grab a sunset shot now my options are severely limited because I've been chasing the light essentially the island is so small that you've got obviously coasts on every single side and I have chased his light down literally I've driven at this light until I got to the coast and this is what I found and it is moving that gap in the clouds where there's that little bit of orange was beautiful yellows as well just moving it's just moving across the sky so fast so I've literally been adjusting my composition as it moves the wind has died down as well and it's just a stunning it's now just a stunning evening absolutely beautiful and it's just got me thinking about these Scottish islands quite a lot a lot of these islands along the west coast of Scotland they can be absolutely brutal really brutal and it's not a case usually of just pointing your camera in any direction and making a great shot it doesn't really work like that on these islands I've found it was the same when I went to Mull a few years ago and I found that here as well you've got to really work for it and I think that's kind of very similar to what life is like here people have got to work for it here same as on molt same as on a lot of the other islands because island life like this is not what as straightforward as living in the cities that I'm used to the ferries that bring me the brought me here they're the lifeblood of this place and it just makes you think a little bit more about our relationship with the landscape our relationship with outdoors and Aaron in particular just has it all yeah it's just stunning and to be able to finish the day with some colour in the sky like this is just exactly what I wanted very very special anyway let me talk you through the shots all right like I said I've just been following this little band of sky around and I'm just smoothing out the water very very gently with the six filter that's on the front here okay let me just just the exposure as the Seas coming around my feet now anyway I've got the horizon on the bottom of the rule of thirds pretty much then just going up into that sky which is now getting a lot of pink up in it smoothing that water out with a 10 second exposure I've gone up to f-16 just to expand that exposure time I'll get that exposure time just a little bit longer to smooth that sea out nicely I'm hoping I'm gonna get a bit of reflection from that color in the sky and it should be an overall good image there's some really nice Pink's coming into that now just as the Sun is setting so stick around till the end for the information on the end screen but this video is man to get 10% off your first order I hope you come visit this place because it's just absolutely stunning I'll see you on another one very very soon subscribe like doing you need to do and that's it I'm Adam this is first man photography in the beautiful Isle of Arran [Music] [Music]
