all right ladies gentlemen welcome back to another episode of our Elle craft I've got such a close up on my face right now as always this is sponsored by description thanks to them for sponsoring anything have you gone on at all since last time not that I've worked on although I did log on a little bit earlier just playing with some settings and it appears to have turned winter everything's cold yeah I can see my breath and I also I popped up here for just a moment and there was a snowy boy yeah I don't know if the snowy boy is still here anymore I don't I don't know what you're complaining about things look fine I can see my bro wow it is wintery oh oh I'm freezing oh the iron probably doesn't help that I don't know whether the iron really factors but uh let's see do you have some I have some wood okay how do we write oh my god how do we explore when it's like this you got a you got it like I know that there's in an update wool will allow you to stay warm easier but on you or like I I don't I don't I know that I have expressed all of the words that I know of how that works okay sounds good see because I want to go and I want to explore that other other thing that we found the the treehouse mm not rating treehouse the other kind of surface dungeon thing though that went down oh okay I didn't know there was a treehouse it's the giant tree house we saw Oh dad thing I have far away thank gotcha gotcha oh I'm down to check that out I just figured you know we're in the more immediate vicinity of the other thing so could just kind of check that out first yeah thank goodness for all these cobwebs step up I'm trying to snag myself a little bit a little bit more wool that way it'll be easier to regen this and the health Chanel Chanel shall not let's see is this like that a fire okay I like myself on fire yeah try not to do that it always hurts a bit any other stuff over here oh thanks where'd that wait what kind of block is this I don't know apparently I don't know how to light a fire Oh redstone block huh but I'm warming up now I think oh are you just because they can't fire are you doing I'm terrified is everything okay no I don't know but it seems to have suffocated whatever it was it was a terrific do you remember in ultra-modern revival in one of the nightmare dimension things there was I think it was the nightmare dimension there was this plant thing that would be on an island right I think it was that kind of thing yeah that I believe it was called the trifid in fact but that was terrifying I wasn't expecting it I don't you know the whole monster is kind of just popping out of random spots it's kind of scary ya know it catches a little off-guard you're just not not quite prepped for it no you aren't no you you very much aren't oh I gotta say that it best far either the torches don't go out or else they last a lot longer than I where I think they just last it kinda and I would need to play with that oh yeah I am okay with this oh yeah I'm so ready to get lost in here though it's gonna be fun I'm so ready his bones are ready so yeah I was mentioning before we started recording those like hey I've always noticed in shaders and stuff that it's all like very yellow colored and that's because of the torches you know flame like I get it but I adjusted it after I was like I want you know my more even whiter light and I so I'd fixed it and then promptly notice that everything looked wrong and I didn't wanna get so so good on me so it turns out that the default shader settings are the ideal shape without what I mmm old pretty sure that mobs can just like hit through walls here yeah yeah you know it's no bueno doesn't sound way no that is a very very jambe dungeon you oh dude this is actually great we can farm we can farm some mega mega XP over here oh good XP would be good because levels oh yeah that's a spider spiders glowing eyes make them like not infinitely but significantly I have also I got a hot tip where did you get a tip on see how this works okay I'm testing and testing right now and I will report back momentary all right please do it sounds very important and I'd like to hear it so then it becomes consumable when you drink it but you do but you do hit the you know live your life do you boil by putting it in a furnace yeah okay dude there is a rare blood sucking zombie the deceiver in here and I think I remember a mod way back when it was in hexxit or something like that that caused these special mobs that when you demonetized one it would give you like some really cool loot drops and stuff I think that might be what this dude is here and that would be amazing I got iron leggings with cooling on them that sounds like the opposite of what I need right now but I'll put them on anyway this thing is great actually oh hey you're here don't don't go in there don't go don't go in there I'm not going in there okay gotcha get some levels cool well we'll work your way there from what where'd you work your way in here from I came the same way you do did you have to you guys been around you I believe spotters wear out after a minute though no so that you specifically can't just farm well I can use iron swords now wow they all want you oh do there's another special Moy no you oh the spawner did you suspect I just yanked me to him oh my sword broke yeah the spawner didn't just disappear actually shoo Oh crane it makes so that does make sense because I was wondering why there weren't spiders down there okay you have to have bee defense eight to where iron right what's up what's up you see we have that's a halberd yeah dude this thing does 11.5 attack damage quality legendary damage reach one shield breach when in hand 10% plus dig speed 11 or 10 percent plus attack speed 15% extra attack damage and plus 0.5 reach and I can use it oh my god sounds legendary there you go there's the thing there's the thing if you want it what is this an iron boomerang can I use it nope I need eight attack a healing self interesting okay yeah anything iron basically you you need to have a little bit of a bonus on that level eight right I'm at level seven on my defense I'm working on it I'm working on it how are you on bandages cuz I did just acquire lots of wool I got one right now but I'm not taking a ton of damn damn at the moment I don't have any wild this place I can give you some wouldn't it be wild if this place connects all the way over to the other place it would be wild mm-hmm okay let's see I can make another decent amount advantages I mean if you get hurt let me know I'll hand him off to you I also got something called an immunize er a special potion that cures immunitech tears immunizes against poison cures and immunizes yeah against poison hunger weakness nausea and paralysis okay so swords are not workable on cobwebs though unfortunately oh I have another spawner ooh nice is it a trumpet boy spawner by any chance no okay cuz it is a zombie spawner mother's dad you don't want to pass out this frickin halberd bro two of them see you side by side side side by side yep oh wow that's tricky dick I hear a lot of guys too so and that's good like the the zombies that we can kill guys as opposed to the guys that can kill us guys right right yeah the guys there's a rare exhausting zombie of lightning oh geez oh hi there oh there's gone now on to you they're all into you I am just very desirable what can I say I dude whoa the reach to reach I knew that's insanity you have that dude this thing just oh my god it demolishes mobs wow this is insane ow and all these wither or thorns or something every time I hit him it hurts just a little guy ow hey get off me what the heck okay I'm okay okay I need water do you've any water on you no good did you collect the stuff yes okay cool what'd you get I haven't looked yet look it all over here paint dogs Photoshop it's all over Oh God give me water okay who why can I not like this oh is it go bad do I need to put more what wow really what I got plaster so that's good okay oh there's some plaster you know I'm assuming we apparently can't do much with it requirements magic for okay I'm trying to think what else is worth leveling up it seems like there are a lot of things we're encountering that require magic to be leveled so I might level up a little bit of magic am I going that magic direction uh-huh all right and boom level eight defense now I can eyes there you go mate take those I will just put on pants yes I'm wearing pants nice dude those will keep you protected what am i fancy fancy you have a crown that's pretty cool is that what the is that what fancy boy dropped I have yeah I don't know what it does doesn't it just says ender Queen's crown oh dude we get to the end of the ender men are gonna just praise you oh okay well that was uh was a successful run down there I'd have to say I I wonder if we can make an anvil is the anvil crafting recipe standard to wacky okay that's far I mean I don't I could be wrong but so far the recipes haven't seemed to be too far off okay well let's see because this halberd is dope and I want to ensure that it does not go by you do not need the requirements to use this item you need level 12 in building oh wow quite the level Wow okay well that seems like a good one that we're gonna want a level up then I wouldn't have to say you know gear I really like the details of the buckle going around the back of the leggings it's pretty cool but it seems like you've got a bit of a vulnerable spot it's like your Achilles rear knee I mean I just yeah I I make it a rule enough to show my knees to anybody the whole Achilles myth always bothered me cuz I'm like why don't you just dip your hand a little bit lower into the water why did the heel have to be above the water level why didn't you just it's pretty impressive that you're able to hold your entire boy by his heel but why didn't you just get your hand in there a little bit you know never understood that part yeah I never understood either still well not not particularly but is there are you boiling water oh yeah see when when you boil it you get the the water it's not terribly fast but then you can place it and drink it you can't take it out of the bucket you put oh you actually place it in its own thing and then it's drinkable yes ha that's very interesting indeed aliy do I like that you stole the bucket kept it on you and now I can't do it anymore because you decided to take it oh you would like to keep drinking so it doesn't I thought maybe it got you back all the way up to full no no no it's still it's still just a now I'm at full okay I just did a real oh there is that that was I did I did that do I was like okay I'm falling from everything yeah the chunk loading here is a trip dude it really is okay so I want to find sugar as well so sugar cane might be good to locate here's some spare water for us and then I was thinking we should just hop real easy yeah I want to explore that little um you know the quarry looking thing and then maybe we can go over to the tree house of terror alright okay I know what you're talking about yeah the tree house Oh terror yeah you know okay so that's purified water that's just sitting there and I'm gonna bring I'll bring to purified waters with me I'm gonna make another bucket purify it and then I guess from there let's go on a little adventure because we want to explore yes yes do we are so geared we're so ready to go we're ready to rock and roll yes see the problem with what you've done there is that I didn't shift okay I knew that was going to go down cool all right let's go adventuring now that we're both able to wear iron armor and wield iron swords and that's a giant rat swords but that's fine oh shoot oh yeah the halberd of heck the halberd of heck Wow I threw it on the ground oh okay all right dude which way do we want to go let's go that way this which okay that is non-specific going this way down here is Bonner or something yeah spawner in here Bob webs are great oh that's the spawner for spiders are they poison spiders regular spiders I haven't had one spawn to know okay I've got a little I've got my little bobble icon on now I don't know it's it's like here you're wearing a crown whoa that ow don't hit me with your pickaxe you ran in front of me I was literally standing still and you hit me James spider case Wow okay we don't want them we don't want them there bad boy they're bad just just seal the gate seal the gate it didn't poison me it hit me a couple times me well you got lucky you must have an immunize er all right so you're wanting to seal this up maybe let's go the other way well I probably keeps going for a while but then there's more to see I bet but I can Explorer these sign yeas here's a chest cobwebs a nametag emerald emeralds cool cool I bet we can't use emeralds for very long time a couple of cold Oh Cobb wait I don't have an axe I have an axe on me giving the chest takes a second would you like me to yeah there you go life is easier when you bring an axe yeah I know we do want to we do want to keep getting cobwebs for the sake of wool for bandages yeah that's okay I'm breaking it cool just making sure Tim just making sure Dube is making sure house a there's a site branch you missed over here or you mean that goes up yeah yeah I figured I know there's another part that goes up what the heck dude what's with all these mazes they're amazing okay yep there's a little another tree area so this seems very similar - yeah I think it might be the same structure actually but the other one was like underground okay you know I'm thinking since this this appears to be pretty much the same thing we've already done maybe let's quest on over to the tree house I'm just following Torchic wait oh this actually is the same this is the same dungeon yak I'm about to end up back in the cave yep I just ended up back at home okay Jesus don't be monetized bud okay exactly what I told you I was shorted shorted by that dude he just came and I had a helmet on but yeah no I was fine and it was like boom just dead I disapprove I disapprove well that's not what you're looking for yep I agree let's make a day and then I've got to go try and help you with some of that I wasn't at least do you want like any year anything that used to go back you'll come in yo come here no you take an iron sword there you go take that okay use an iron sword how many times can I tell you then take a stone sword or make a stone so you can sit how do you say no I was like what are you sit right clicked on that I can't right click oh maybe empty hand we need more ah yeah dude I'm sitting dude this is sick okay we don't have any oh here's some need to get the mark torch yes very money more torches you have a stick I have several sticks dude several sticks indeed all right dude I think as long as you got your stuff back I do it's about treehouse time dude it's treehouse time yeah yeah see how how far we get before we end up good good stupid oh no that's gigantic holy mother of god what are you fighting oh I'm not fighting that that's not gonna be something I'm fighting okay well what did you see oh just come back to the cave entrance it's hard to miss okay you're and you you need to correct yeah they're the giant fireball that looks big it's a big boy it's very big boy I can I can take these buds out the blue water wrapped I'm going to be fair he doesn't see me doing much oh he's hugging fireballs they're harming far they homing missiles no I can't tell but they're probably gonna light the forest on fire which is probably not good oh yeah they'll an is lava yeah yeah it's go kill him with your halberd because it's very cold up here disagree with that assessment and I did get a blaze rod from one of those other dudes here's what we're gonna do I am just really quickly I'm gonna go ahead and I wish that fairy would regen me I'm gonna make a few more bandages okay well shall we shall we go quest to the treehouse I am up top ready for you he dokie I'm going to bring furnace and let's hope for the best poor boy yeah I'm Ronen on nine porkchops in my inventory and that's about it Oh give me a little bit of regen thank you Thank You fairy you're so nice okay I got a I'm gonna be careful of fireable wayna I assume he just kind of hangs out on top of the volcano but III bet you want to go closer and just just I just want to see what he looks like full size yeah sure I'm right behind you he's large yes he's quite large what's he called he's called a umber lappam number loader Amer lobber I'm just a little bit worried about the little ember lava balls yep yep I'm gonna go elsewhere I feel like it's just not gonna go in our favor let's go to the tree house he noticed that you were there I noticed he wasn't he did okay do we know how to get back here didn't he be I mean I guess we monetize and then we end up back there okay so I don't like my chunks allotted far enough out but I believe it was over in this direction right where yes there it is I see it I see it hey I overhear you as you we also have another Dungeon II looking structure along the way with there's a lot of structures oh it's a creeper face that seems safe okay we'll focus on later we did say requesting to the treehouse well is that the thing I was with yes attack I guess it's chill yeah I am glowing and have night vision well you have some weird effect on whoa dude deep with them what I see inside of myself I see inside of you what the heck bro oh there's a lot going on over here yep freakin x-ray vision on certain mobs this bizarre we should probably get that cow there's a dinosaur that appears to be hostile eating that cow I want no don't steal my meet you feathery dinosaur which is apparently how dinosaurs actually he's it's a velociraptor okay I'm gonna help no it's not it's a Venter Raptor I'll get rekt freakin Vento Raptor no more venti Starbucks for you that's where you're going with a venti Raptor dude it's like I think it's an effect from your halberd what is what adds magical effect is no I think it was from the wispy dude oh hey there's a skeleton spawner here oh oh is this gonna be a place where there are lots of spawners everywhere there's a lot of cobwebs and when fire thing there's a book Oh 30 times and Honus what oh but buddy buddy buddy oh my god yeah yeah I know that feeling dude I was full out that he just grabs my face I gotta come back I gotta come back I'm running back I need my stuff I'm coming back I'm coming back oh no oh no oh no are you near my gear oh I'm right all over your gear oh good lord Oh buddy it's a bad news shoo Asian we don't like this the treehouse was a mistake and we didn't even get to it yet oh there's we Oh creepers and I don't know how we completed the challenge knife or duel okay not sure how that works I've not picked up much oh boy oh boy I gotta get your gear in I guess it's just all over the place don't hedge shot God dang it how do we do this how do we deal with this situation this is a bad sitcom back I'm no okay that do you monetize come back sleep and then things will be better things will be okay well I didn't have much choice anyway yeah let's give it an option they said this whole head short thing is a problem it's it's I mean we're wearing helmets yeah well not anymore we aren't is anything I am bringing well okay not really not really well okay the best you could take this iron axe that I can't use yeah I can't use either that's gathering oh well okay it's all right we're running back we're just gonna run back over and over and hope that we do it within 5 minutes and nothing these spawns I want my help or my halberd is the best I should have just tortured up that spawner that was a mistake Frick Frick Frick boys Frick Go Go thank you for letting out fire ooh god oh god oh god oh god oh oh god okay I managed you get out with not everything demonetized okay is my I don't have my halberd god dang it where's my freaking halberd bro it I I died more towards the entrance you were deeper in I know I know I'm trying to find my freakin house honor oh yeah good point good point good point I don't know Nick Nick you have the iron pick I have an IVA stone pick I can do it here you go here we go there's your iron pick the guy I got it we're good okay thank goodness thank goodness okay it's possible your halberd flew oh it's right here I found your oh thank frickin goodness boots I think uh here's a helmet for me I have boots you have boots oh no those are like I don't know where I don't have leggings have a chestplate but I have a helmet that you're like okay yeah no skeletons boners are bad bad news so the only bummer with not having my iron sword is that I'm not gonna be able to harvest any cobwebs but we do have a lot of cobwebs for stem sword if you're no it's okay um I was okay so this kind of reminds me of um yeah the old hexxit because these books here I don't think are very integral to anything they're just like a bunch of random passages from stuff right if you feel like some additional reading feel free here if you're looking for a little bit of lore then there you go okay alright so so yeah they are well they'll start spawning at night yeah I don't think it's worth building an entire structure for now because it's limited uses anyway so it's like yeah let's just keep on during the daytime exploring the treehouse in the hopes that we can not wait you monetize what's up Jerry wind chimes so yeah get you get the heels yeah that's what I'm doing so what's our best way to enter here will you what are you checking out I think this is dragon work mmm cool sounds like fire huh let's enter the tree where where shall we enter is there a grand entrance anywhere hmm down there oh is it over here no out I figured that would be the place but it doesn't seem to be the place you get in I just cut in oh okay I guess that work eight oh wow this is oh my god dude imagine if we fall have your water bucket ready does this go it's still a very long ways as the problem is my bucket of water I might end up drinking so if I do fall you know regular regular water bucket is fine you don't actually consume it I think my water is purified oh I I have one of each okay cool so we can always get back up to I'm getting a little parched myself so yeah I think that it gets us back to what is it like seven and a half water if you drink just black which doesn't seem that bad I kind of like that deal as long as there's no like risk of you getting dysentery or something you make it up oh yeah quite a view this is gorgeous dude do you see that thing floating in the sky over there I'm pretty sure that's the snow snow boy that I saw earlier is it maybe not there is a flying boy though yeah I see him I see him over there okay I wonder if there's anything else a little bit higher yeah there's a little been a fun adventure this is oh there's stairs up no are there oh yeah no I hit my head - I was like is there another side that's better no dude just imagine if we had vein miner tree capital dude wait adjust lag the entire game out okay come on I'm not hurting anymore I'm not hurting anymore okay temps are going out if this is good yeah oh my god dude winter really just came what I can tell the campfire is single-use I mean it is nighttime - so um like I couldn't really like the one in our base after it went out I don't know how long and then then also you know we are higher altitude so it that much of a difference between the ground and a couple hundred feet up oh yeah really when you're like oh yeah no okay and realize wait a minute thanks mean it is okay I just realize you just like shop oh wait we can't chop it into planks I guess unless we've actually placed it down that's interesting is that true quick shift wrinkly wait what how come I can't chop this with my ax let's go can't either I wonder if it's part of a bigger structure if it disables it okay alright here we go I'm gonna go I'm going it's gonna probably bring my temps down but I want to see what's up here okay my temps are going down damn I getting cold how are you like you were making the weirdest path I'm just building straight up oh you're just blocking up yeah I was I thought I thought you were taking a path so I was like wait that's weird I can't well uh we have successfully managed to there's not really anything here just a big tree just a big tree house huh yeah okay right I had baked them now here now I am cold and I am very cold I don't like being this cold where's that we're stuck we are stuck I don't know how to get back home alright but I don't know how to get back home without freezing we might have to just chill up here for the night literally do you have more cobblestone I do yes sixty four okay good then as long as we have sticks wood and cobblestone we can make another campfire is necessary okay so any s'mores or stories you can tell no I just want to get out of here really now I am on fire now don't step in the frickin thing I didn't mean to walk in there kept fire oh nice nice bro what your hey hey you were you swept away the cobblestone Oh with your shift I just told you it down you throw it down into the leaves and that's why I dropped down to get it and then you put the water to and circle anyway it's fine do you need the college done I just I was gonna make a spare campfire and now I can't there you go shift shift currently there you got it got it got everything is fine there's nothing doors like oh it's right down there let me just jump down and then water everywhere haha that works perfectly you want to take the speedy way down brah don't take this beauty way down you know take speedy way the quick way yes you should take faced way down three years so over here seems like bad fire you the campfire I don't have I do have a campfire and I'm trying to make sure that I picked up that table that I just dropped alright alright do it do it you ready are you ready okay yep here we go okay he's just going far far down my mans is fearless we good did you make it all the way yeah nice dude and I see you were scared I wasn't so scary stuff I wasn't skirt oh it's a zombie villager okay you ready are you running back I mean the I mean the place where the zombie spawner is okay I'll let me give these Pig just wait this second Gothel de monetize this pig oh okay you're just gonna try to take advantage of that for a sec minute oh the range though dude I just need to I need the level up to be able to have the anvil I'm sure eventually my halberd is gonna be out class but for the time being it's been a time being it's fantastic do we need a little campfire ruski if we want working on it I'm working on it I it isn't lighting very well oh there we go okay now sticks ow frickin wither boy ow okay I do like those guys though even if they're annoying to deal with okay zombie spawner is out i got an iron hammer with enhance knock back nauseous blow lesser smite for attack damn damn eight hmm interesting you know a lot of bandages which apparently I can do what why I got a lot of levels actually if I get magic up to six I can use this let's see what happens whoa yeah these are good these are amazing tech what a good these bandages are good yeah get your magic up the the magic six ones because you can actually let me see it's from the what mod is it I don't know rough tweaks I think it's rough tweaks it's the third one if you search bandage it just heals you every time that you right-click it it just it's like you're charging a bow and it has 12 uses and then it just keeps on healing half a heart each time so here you can take these for now until you get magic up to six because these are cool dude this is clutch Oh key dokey all right I just got a big old Wraith coming in too so that's nice you got wait there's a raid for me in game oh okay all right all right give you a moment my dude bie I really was expecting more and I don't know if there were side off in Chester so something to flick us off the top or something like that - I figured that they were like oh yeah it didn't seem like the core area led anywhere either but you know what this is whoa this is well okay good mm-hmm so we can make over bandages yes sir cuz even the fancier bandages uh they what the heck why go for the other thing you're punching you know you go for the other thing you walked in front of oh my god I blame your parents okay oh Jesus that rat just like hits here and then it was gone so even the nicer bandages that I'm using now Claire the magical little six that you have to make the basic bandage first and then you also have a healing salves so it's really nice actually that you can get these from mob drops because otherwise there's a little pain yeah yeah yeah fortunately yeah okay so we've ripped apart this place it's now day time do you want to try and get back to home base or why me we should yeah we should probably run back to home base just cleared an inventory a little bit and we we did some pretty good work pretty good exploration pretty good conquering and questing it's just how about snow pan out come here to monetize the giant mecha wonder what happens if you accidentally hit a dinosaur I mean we killed that feathery one a minute ago a big dinosaur a big one none of this small dinosaur BS yeah I see well you should go up and poke one or if the Umbrian lobber is still there than we can you go check you want to try to fight that dude seriously saying that's an option you could you could do if you're feeling bored I mean it's certainly an option but is it a smart option not absolutely absolutely not it's not a smart option there's the creeperface there's some pumpkins okay oh he's still there he's very much still present and accounted for good if we blow I would be much more confident that's what we see have some arrows but yeah why don't you lows there's a giant flappy thing along the way there's another wisp all right I'm gonna make a bow and I'm gonna poke the Beehive as my final act of today's episode I need I need some water and then here I've got three arrows you can have and your endeavor oh thank you I appreciate you helping me out with this situation I mean I just you just what yes my shaders appear to have gone nuts I was just blinking either that or I was it was some effect but maybe you're dehydrated my the the lights were blinking and yet no one was home so I wonder why you actually I wonder if the game classifies particular areas is like a tree structure and you can't shop while you're on the I think there's an MBT today a tag that gets into the block when you place it that allows it to then be converted into planks no one I placed it while I was on the tree yeah I was able to make planks too so you were able to make planks oh I was not able to I don't know why you're so broken okay no let me ask you for this nobody asked you for this input so anyway do you happen to have that song I do I'd love it that underneath you thank you all right purify something you ready to wait watch watch I'm gonna get a bow and it's gonna be like you can't use that right now yeah it's probably gonna have to level up your levels alright well let's find out here we go gonna make a bow which one what are we I wish you the best in your quest and remind you that I have a crown so I hope that you were able I need to be level 2 on something which ok that seems fairly accessible level 2 for agility okay well let's probably repeat level 2 agility there we go shouting me that is a let's go poke the beehive don't touch it I want you to touch it on the butt and I'm not gonna do that oh you lookin at me you looking at me he um it bounced off of him it bounced off it didn't do any that was oh there's a oh yeah this fire is a fire lizard lizard lizard okay I have ranged your Halbert I have range i oh oh kersploosh oh you're fiery the phone no they dropped fiery things though a kersploosh dog hell I'm on fire down oh no no I must get to the water right when I got to the water it gave out yeah was when it went out yeah yeah okay well we still can't pick kill big dude with arrows cuz I was pretty sure our three arrows were definitely gonna take him down but ya know does that work so we're just coexisting for the time being I guess you can call it that he doesn't seem to be too eager to let go on the move so that's nice that's nice alright well I have food and water and everything is okay well shall we wind it down there for this episode yeah out the links in our
