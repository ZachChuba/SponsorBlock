alright ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another episode of RL craft continuing where we last left off here in the dungeon we smooth things out a little bit should be a little bit nicer as we continue here although there is a chance if things get super laggy again we might have to do a quick difficulty toggle just so that we can you know have a playable game but otherwise we'll be you know we'll be doing things as per usual but the quality of the recording is the priority anyway that or you can play whatever else you want fun multiplayer minecraft also and sorry to have this on your end but because people are gonna be wondering I have a bandaid on my face on my end um pretty much got a got a little thing got a little issue um I've mentioned it previously on my stuff but oh nice do that cobol's go and ham I'm hoping it's a it's a sore from like an infected pimple or something and not skin cancer me the way I trim my beard so that was the only thing kind of standing in the way of it showing all of its gross Ness so I'm just covering the gross Ness that's all don't worry dermatologist appointment on Monday so hopefully that'll sort it out anyway I know all your people needed to hear that all those guys like instantly came at me bro yeah very there is a there's a big boy in there though dude I need to I need to summon some cobalt go ahead and eat the chupacabra me get myself all nice and good again because I like we only have we only have 12 we started off with like a bunch I feel like did you have some previously yeah one down one down a lot of stuff dies oh you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna break this I feel like that'll yeah Oh mother trucker Oh getting zapped through the frickin wall no oh no he's Lizzy my god I need help holy sweet mother God okay okay holy crap there's a chest in here dude and there's a lot of guys in there oh and I'm at somebody break this if I can what do we got what do we got oh we got some emerald torches things like that quick quick quick Yeats behind you yep okay we're good we're good whew slightly overwhelming at least you know the spotters can't spawn forever right got him got him we're doing good there's that sham blur um who is in the water who's a special boy who could have some real Oh careful I'm hitting through this I don't wanna hit you okay creeper oh that's my favor that was an Enderman yeah it was an Enderman as for the the thing where they you know make us go foggy what Oh retreat for a moment okay so question is there any wood that I can retreat oh we got one of these um eyes are laser dude bro so so if you can grab stuff tonight what I had was a lot of oh my inventory must have just kind of filled up but yeah I grabbed him most of your stuffs I'm gonna make more chests because apparently we need them quite quite significantly badly so your stuff got eated to the wall which is problematic because there's a there's a Superboy on the other side of the wall I mean I noticed that there were a lot a lot of really kind of bad things I don't feel like that emerald ring is really worth carrying from him oh he's a problem it he's a prize he's a problem yeah because he oh oh god frickin facehugger get it up get it off darlings yeah um it's a problem because he actually regions like immediately it's it's actually wild he cannot take damage and my summoning staff is one of the things okay I'm going for I went for your other stuff I went for your other stuff I'll see if I got it I don't know if I got it or not but did I yep I got you summoning one okay good there you go so I do not know how we're gonna take care of the super duper guy in there because of the fact that his region is instantaneous gigantic termite its students enter the wall what the heck oh there's another one there was like sticking its head through the wall I was bizarre dude it actually did drop a wood it was like a termite I do any cobblestones by any chance I do how can I have some of that I know perhaps I think kind of blocking up behind this doesn't feel like it's effective wrong-o is he another super boy who is not I'm just sitting here hitting him for all I can hit all right so or is it the blighted guy this is a lot of stuff in there that yeah I don't know how we would possibly be able to deal with I mean we kind of just have to like take him out through the wall at first I feel like now what the heck just hit me let me get this guy there we go see drop sticks is that really what he's ready drop sticks extremely great I don't think the shamblers are ranged so I guess at least you got that going here though they are so I guess they all insta heal so that's not a unique thing okay so you just have to hit him real quick is that have you been able to kill any of them I am almost yep there we go gonna hurt them really hard pretty much it seems to be the case there's a dark shadow oh good so it's an extra yeah that's is that the big boy yeah fire would he'd light you on fire yeah I guess don't make contact God it just takes so much freaking weight if you where did you go to why is he going over there come back over here you idiot I want your loot yeah well who's shooting the bow you have so much stuff going on right now this I can't see that students health bar and it is just draining my sword durability continue it's like my got amis I got em frickin Frick dog whoa leader ruh-roh Oh I thought it's a leader guru lunar GRU lunar drew I got it wait Deacon he faints through walls yeah no lunar cruise could go through walls that is a big boy that is a gigantic boy in the dark well then let me like this area up huh don't feel like this is working out like if we can get all these until they don't spawn anymore then we'll definitely be able to go and invade they are still spawning though is the unfortunate part is that part looking more realistic over there oh oh no not the rat not the rat I can't I can't okay there we go I'm trying to help you trying to help you without hitting it there we go there we go you good what is that a violent Cal pod done ripped yeah these aren't hard to kill that's but you can kill him and they'll spawn more like on death oh that's what I was saying of where I was annoyed it's like okay they animate you they have thorns no it just seems like they're hitting me every time okay oh god I think I hit you I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I'm in ok shave okay I think that I'm gonna take advantage of my 21 levels and level up a couple of skills right now and see attack it's broken spawner oh I think I can use a diamond sword actually no no way it's growing wow that's a big guy is he very very high on him oh no no those guys are fine dude and sir can easy peasy lemon squeezy all right famous last words obviously yeah Oh stone rapier if you if that will help I don't know if that'll help or not but stone Herrick what is a case TISS there's no idea with that bro leather boots leather tunic sick dungeon dude best best stuff I know everyone's like you need to explore you find amazing stuff and it's like yeah I mean maybe as we venture Oh what what spiders this is okay stairs that maybe as we venture in deeper I don't know I think I feel like it's pretty random but I mean maybe this there was a clear defined entrance to this so there's a lot of spiders and spawners at the top if you can get them if you look up oh they're out on that hold on oh god oh god we got a chopper dude yeah that's good yeah we want we want to kill that there is a heal thing in here oh yeah if you look up top and when you go around the corner and look up you can open a spider spawner Oh try and get we do the furnace right so maybe worth just tossing those chupacabra meats in yeah it's just behind this company up there all right did you snag these spawners or still need to do it no they're still there okay I didn't I tried to be non aggressive without my backup I actually don't see where they are it's up the column oh it looks like they popped oh okay cool a couple of breads cool cool we got a Sam Brown okay I see a spawn about which we're gonna want to be careful of that poison okay Enderman where's the end of it I mean are you are you looking at it or you're just calling it out calling it out okay I've been hurt before by him so I was taking notes these answers are good farm oh well we got like a big n't big end boy done dude done ain't no thang my iron rapier is in trouble did we bring the anvil with us probably not Oh No hey spiders oh geez you hate to see it Oh God make those call-outs do ya duty he was ready to get you holy dude now this is a car alright let's back it up make sure we're definitely not hitting at each other right okay what do we're making quick work for these boys though heck yeah we are Oh chupacabra what up dog there we go there we go ain't no thing ain't no thing all right more chupacabra meats always give them a ride back to the furnace okay so I just made the Diamond rapier and mine is a graceful quality with 15% dig speed for all the digging that I can use on the race pool and but 15% additional attack speed which is very nice yeah that's and I'll be able to use it once I get one more level up under attack but I wanted to have it so I'd kind of be like ready to rock and roll hold on give me some levels bud dude I could I could use a little bit of our level so I can get off I feel freaking weaker than before if there's a witch spawner I'm gonna be nervous yeah witches aren't terribly fun I also need Oh Frick you need one either no I need um what was that oh it's a glass bottle sorry I was like really enthralled by the glass bottles they look very fancy it's a bottle you know what calm yourself dude oh can I can I level up can I get the diamond to rapier let's find out attack no I think I actually have to get to level 16 to do it shoot but I can smell more chupacabra there we go I got three off that one dude ah I just need more arrows that's the biggest bummer though if only we could make more arrows we would be so set range all right range is like mega essential oh that's that's a super Skelly super scale you over here dude

help another person cuz it's more likely you're gonna do monetize the person than the darkling I feel like man everything is hitting my head a throwing knife a stone lance and emerald I want to try this throwing knife actually and see what happens whoa it gives you like a weight potion of region Oh get Brett whoa freaking Dark Link off me bro Oh is a room full of witches over here dude it is a

regarded differently whoa alright that was a good run though no one is demonetized so that's exciting I guess so yeah you're right okay well we need to they do drop the beds or so we need to get you one of those if you don't already have it equipped okay I just I just broke two of them I broke two of them a diamond pickaxe turns out you can get some good stuff in here so there's also an Enderman

need you to oh this is gonna you died in a rough spot dude oh that's you died in a real rough spot I'm gonna try to dump out my inventory so I can come back and fetch your stuff I wonder if I could use water to like push them away mmm okay so I mean it would push the items - oh you do bring up a point that is a point that you have there okay well uh this feels this feels like a recurring theme well I know I'm just I'm trying was complaining about how big of a wuss I was with the dragon so I've been you know we've been working harder Oh God there is so much stuff on the ground oh no three wards Oh Lord dude oh my god I don't know how I'm gonna do this I don't know how I'm gonna do this oh god oh god I don't I do not know oh there's another one yet they say they are a problem Adam a weapon uh uh weapon that I can get hold on let me take care of this first yeah weapon that I can give you yes iron rapier there you go thank you okay water okay oh there are so many if we get rid of all the wargs yeah oh well that probably blew up a few things except for the spawner didn't blow up the spawner yeah of course not yeah but I mean more like the items yeah you still have items already just back it off how though how can there be that just just just are you okay even there you good yeah yeah I'm fine okay alright alright I don't care full of each other okay alright here let me see if I can clear this okay going Sivan grab your stuff oh I'm grabbing everything I can grab okay oh dude there's a helmet helmet here helmet here hey there you go okay holy crap so what got blown up what got lit up so what's left let's regroup oh my um here are you another another iron rapier that's a that's a shield Bronco that's your shield though that's good okay there you go and let's see what else a potion of healing that was yours I think you had that healing selves and otherwise I think everything else is in the chest over at our regroup location hey you got my armor I got and you got the iron rapier look I got my art torches which was good and I got both rapiers I don't know it doesn't look like I really lost much other really really thirsty right now okay well done not bad nothing gonna help yeah absolutely I didn't think it was gonna work out that well honestly so yes it hasn't in the past historically speaking okay I wonder oh god dude I still want to clear this room and I wonder if the Diamonds can help make that a reality like we can just take keep taking them out until they stop spawning right yeah no that's been a it's been a perfectly valid thing it's just not the most ideal what the hell I'm so that's unfortunate man where was that past him it was just right over near the link at the edge of our thing okay that was very disconcerting I wasn't taking damage was that oh no it was just over by not in right at the creeper area but in that same spot okay where are you going okay okay give me a moment to clear out my inventory again I'm collecting your experience so sorry about that Oh freaking dark bling mother that's your frikar mother breakthrough well is there oh there's two no no no get off there's so there's a grue dude you died in the worst spot imaginable oh my god what the heck bro you died in such a terrible spot I was just torch yeah cuz torches mean nothing can try to attack you listen I'm just saying there wasn't anything there that looked to be hostile at the moment oh my god okay well almost that could have been that could have both of our stuffs right there and then that would have been fun okay I'm gonna need you to when you go in here inventory and look at stuff I'm gonna need you to not be wear any like make sure you're back at our starting area that's this that's the rules I wasn't so much in my inventory as much as just coming by and in the darkling just oh okay gotcha I thought I thought that you were like swearing I was about you I can't get can't get you while you're next to it yeah it does this thing will not do okay oh my god so did you pick up everything and drop in the chest yep yep it's in it's in mostly the new chest mostly the nude chest yeah I feel like I've done this before same verse now but now I'm a lava bucket don't know where that came from and I just I emptied some of my stuff that I was not saying pickaxe yeah yeah diamond pickaxe was also I put that in there there's also make extra bandages things like that it's kind of nice I don't have my rapier oh really yeah I don't know it hasn't been five minutes but I didn't see it over no I did it's just somewhere where you can't see it oh oh it's in the water got it I got it cool I did not whoa there's a spire in the water eh that was that's interesting okay I might have got some more spawning cool oh yeah I got I got a few more things that seemed to be a little hidden around okay here's what I'm feeling like I I feel like let's maybe we can see we can just kind of take these guys down potentially these guys are still here just drives you nuts doesn't it it really does because I bet like there are a couple of big boys in there and they could yield some actually good stuff that's the thing that's the things I'm interested in you know I'm interested in what sort of items they could yield and you know what also I'm really happy about is the fact that we're gonna know exactly how to get back to the way stone whoa whoa whoa is that a frickin guru that just spawned out of nowhere yeah no they spawn in darkness I mean I don't really know of a way to get them out of the water is the issue yeah no no I I get that we don't necessarily have an option for it but I'm just trying to think of what's causing it do they region is insane oh my god I bet you it is the water cuz I've only been able to get them outside of the water it's either that or they're special I can't tell but from your side I might be able to oh yeah okay so that one's been looted there's no and what the crap who shot me yeah you'll get shot randomly from things you don't see I noticed that myself and I was like oh this is less than the tail up Ewing don't know if the skeleton is still over there I'm just waiting to get hit in the head keep getting slowed you might be able to reach pretty far though are you able to know oh yes it's definitely the water alright I see that's a slight issue given that um oh they're all bouncing diamonds yeah yeah I don't I'm not sure how to deal with that one unfortunately like we've not got sponges so well I the way I got that one guy that we just killed is I just put some cobble down in the water and so the he this has lots of stuff in it yes we have diamond hoe it is a very exciting sounds useless potion a healing potion of regional silver hammer my inventory is full well whoa whoa whoa everything is fired Jesus Christ everything is fire oh god there's owner there's a lot of guys can't even hit him I can't even hit him got it got it got it got it god we got more zombies coming and do they're coming in right I blocked it out okay cool good call good call this dude right I got I got some loot in that one though I got loot give me the loot I don't know what what is a lesser sharpness for axe I've got 30 seconds of poison that's right always here actually hey hey here you go see if you can just put that in your baubles real quick and maybe we'll cancel it cool yep easy peasy lemon squeezy there you go unless you need it yes I'll take it easy peasy lemon Scorsese I'm out here dude I'm out here to help you got some instant health regen well region also got another enchanted Oh enchanted book reinforced sharpness one difficulty endowment three what in the world increases or decreases your damage based on your world's difficulty what what what's the idea oh I'm so stupid why are you stupid because we I thought I was like we don't have anything that could turn the alright oh yeah let's take care of these boys real quick oh boy there are a lot of zambese no freaking dark dark you get the four back alright wow there's so many zone that spawner has got to be exhausted I mean seriously dude Oh careful Chupacabra okay nice nice nice dude we're gonna get all that chupacabra me good great fancy I mean I stood over that way inspired yeah one spot where it's not really that needed oh okay he's out he's out oh oh I'm on fire we're jumping to the water I'm gonna kill him yeah yeah he's he's down but we're gonna get fancy boy next I guess mother Frick okay yeah did that did that drop fancy things right in the lava I might have picked up something I don't know oh okay I got a robber and I'm not really seeing anything particularly need anything particularly meats meat anything 400 skele bro in the other room carefully headshots oh god that hurt in this room yep yep yep I'm gonna I'm gonna back for a second okay cool because he I'm pretty sure he had shorted me based on the graphics that appeared I don't know what just happened my money that that's sort the 2-handed just went away uh it gets stolen by a special boy that's stolen I didn't just win away Oh easy there bud okay excuse me waiting yeah thank you excuse me lady jeez Karen Karen come on man let's just all right block these off for a moment yeah all right no a potion inch interests in health against liver I'm actually gotta love so many she delivers I'm actually maximum maximum health so yeah yeah I mean all the stuff that we're accumulating in here is making it a little bit easier to read you and all the bandages all the potions are read you I don't have permit orders do you have some torches I have one permit torch currently and no others you used all 40 that were in the chest I wasn't looking at so we have okay cool every about it I was like that was a lot of torches I don't think he placed down 40 what oh this is good news because I don't want to get Shue stood by skeleton skeletons I still think are the most hazard they're not they're not nice we don't like skeletons what is it it's a scout that will give me that me them arrows though okay you know what what is good is they will give us arrows so end Oh more arrows okay yeah let me just throw a javelin at their face real quick this is gonna be good it's gonna be good hey you know whatever works I'm about to throw a javelin at this which doesn't do much damage I've got poison it I also if I could stop picking a pumpkin seeds I wouldn't necessarily be mad about that here's an arrow for you an arrow oh I actually I picked up a bow apparently oh nice yeah that's always good that's always good and there's a there's a there's a now there's a fight going on between them and someone else over there they're having some infighting dude minecraft Civil War I think it's the the witches yeah I have noticed none of them that was the thing that I said fire everywhere - oh yeah yeah no definitely fire everywhere on that whoa well you know I feel like we've made some pretty I was about to say I feel like we've made some pretty good progress in this episode and then and then that when took place which is definitely an unfortunate circumstance every time yeah and I can't tell all right well I'm going to do my best to attempt again I wasn't in the room where all your stuff went into the room of course it did of course yeah it was extreme so what are you no I'm just I'm here to tank for you okay I'm here I'm your tank today yeah I'm trying to figure out look forward to the get good comments this okay let's see let me Google how to not get shot in the head by in Minecraft I'm trying to figure this one out because um it's it's dangerous it's this like skeletons are the most dangerous I'm trying I I don't know how I'm gonna do this and not get absolutely pooped on oh my god there's so many skills God how am I going to frickin do this okay I've gotten some of your armor back at least so we got that going for us I got you a weapon I got you that stuff I just don't know how to get whatever else is in there is the issue yeah I mean most of what's else is in there isn't terrible so this chest has other stuff the torches are useful there is torches torches are in here the bad torch isn't a good tour I had some good torches okay they're fighting each other which is good okay I got some good I got some more come to me if you dare oh it's a fancy skele bro over there fancy skele bro he just withered me or something Jesus okay so as I was saying I feel like we've been making some pretty good progress do you have some blocks to block off that one on the right side block out the one I'm getting shots like just just there's nothing on the this over here eight ahead yeah yeah yeah yeah if we can just block a little bit yeah so should we wind things down yeah try it out with your friends and see how you do also in that same description keep in mind that there is a link to the playlist so you can catch up on any any episodes you might have missed and that should be is there anything else you want to throw on here for us oh no I think that pretty much covers it we just we have a lot of stuff to sort through and definitely need to rebuild some of our armor but for the most part it seems like we haven't lost too many completely essential things and we have a lot of redundancy with weapons now in the chest itself this ran should be ready for next time all right bye guys [Music]
