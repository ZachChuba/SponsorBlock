this video is supported by Squarespace space travel seems to be going down a couple of different directions right now we've all seen the mock-ups of the bfr and the new Glenn from Blue Origin stacked up against the saturn v and touting how is the biggest rocket ever made I mean big is right there in the BFRs name of course so is king or falcon people get upset no matter how I do it so that is one direction toward these big super heavy reusable rockets that can put big huge satellites into space or a large number of smaller satellites into space or a large number of people you get that sort of economy of scale with those big Rockets but satellites are getting smaller and smaller with tiny little cube SATs capable of telecommunications imaging and science stuff that normally would require huge payloads so there's also a trend towards smaller rockets they're launching payloads like that rocket labs electron rocket for example which I've covered in the past there's a 3d printed engine that's so small you can literally just carry it around and their goal is to get Rockets going up almost once a week with much smaller payloads and keeping the prices down that way but earlier this year the race of the small got a whole new leader when the Japanese space agency JAXA put a CubeSat into orbit using the smallest orbital rocket ever the launch was performed on their SS 520 rocket which is literally just a sounding rocket that they added a third stage to in order to make it reach orbit the Rockets only 31 feet tall in less than two feet in diameter it's basically a surface-to-air missile they were able to get into orbit the ability to launch payloads into space on Rockets this small opens up a whole new opportunity for people who want to enter this whole new space race this was a huge win for JAXA but this was nowhere near their biggest success for this year Jack's S stands for Japanese aerospace exploration agency and it was actually a merger of three different agencies that came together in the year 2003 the Institute has faced an astronomical science or Isis fairly unfortunate initials was created in the 1950s at the University of Tokyo and developed rockets and satellites launching dozens of satellites and interplanetary probes in the 70s and 80s the National aerospace laboratories or nal was also created in the 50s and focused on aircraft rockets and other aeronautical transportation systems and the national space development agency of Japan or NASA was founded in 1969 and was possible for building launch systems developing satellites and tracking technologies the first chief of NASA was actually had a Oshima who was the chief engineer behind Japan's first bullet train each of these different space agencies had racked up some impressive wins over the years so it only made sense for them to combine into one coherent vision which they put together and called JAXA 2025 this vision involved the building of the moon base and then populating that moon base with robots to sort of maintain and help grow it and this also kind of piggyback off of george w bush's plan for nasa to have a moon base up by the year 2020 which as we all know has worked out perfectly Jackson got off to a rough start when their first launch as a unified agency ended in failure on their new rocket the h-2a in the pre jacks of days Isis actually focused on smaller solid rocket boosters whereas Nazz de on larger liquid fueled boosters or sometimes they license American Rockets as well but the h-2a was the first Japanese built rocket that they had to work with it's a two-stage rocket powered by liquid oxygen and hydrogen flanked by a duo of strap-on solid rocket boosters the rocket actually had a string of five successes underne as de but this first launched under JAXA fell apart due to high gas leak in one of the solid rocket boosters and this grounded Jax's fleet for about 15 months but since then it's worked flawlessly and actually in 2010 they introduced a new rocket called the h2 B they launched out of the tanegashima space center on Tanegashima island which some say is one of the most beautiful life sites in the world although rocket lab may have something to say about that now JAXA does have a manned space program although they don't have any rockets to actually get their astronauts into space they have to rely on Russian Rockets you know just like we do there are seven current JAXA astronauts and four former astronauts for a grand total of seven the first Japanese astronaut in space most mamuro Mori who went up on 1985 when the space shuttle Endeavour he did this through Nasdaq in the day today JAXA astronauts regularly traveled to the ISS the most recent one left in June of this year and while up there they help to maintain another of Jax's big accomplishments the Kibo space module the Kibo module also known as the Japanese experimental module or je M is the largest single module on the ISS it includes a pressurized space for astronauts to work and live but also an exposed facility which they call the terrace that allows for science experiments in exposed space and these experiments are handled and carried out by a state-of-the-art Karm also designed by Jackson some other major successes for Jackson include the Kaguya moon orbiter Washington 2007 the Kaguya mission which also went by Selene you know just to make everything complicated took detailed observations of the moon's gravitational field including the first accurate reading of the field on the far side of the Moon and was a mission that found permanently shaded craters at the South Pole of the moon that might be the best option for lunar bases in the future another standout project from JAXA was called the planets II mission also known as atsuki that went to Venus atsuki launched in May of 2010 and was supposed to enter orbit six months later but a failed orbital injection burn sent the craft in a heliocentric orbit in other words instead of orbiting Venus it orbited the Sun kind of alongside Venus so for five years at tsuki just kind of floated around out there waiting for its path to line back up with the planet but when it did the engineers at JAXA science this data that did a series of orbital maneuvers to get it into a very highly elliptical orbit which is not really what they had in mind but by god they made it work at tsuki immediately produced some interesting findings when it spotted what they called a gravity wave across Venus in its clouds a giant wave in the atmosphere that stretched from north to south poles JAXA scientists named this phenomenon the Venusian equatorial jet which is similar to the jet stream here on earth also when this mission was the Icarus solar cell which became the first solar sail to travel to another planet they actually did some really cool stuff with Icarus including steering it not by using any kind of propellant but by shifting between lighter and darker shades of material on the sail which absorbed and reflected various amounts of the solar wind but for me anyway the project that really puts JAXA on the map is the Hayabusa sample return missions Hayabusa which is Japanese for Falcon is a JAXA program that actually interacted with an asteroid and returned a sample of material from that asteroid to earth and some of the technology here is friggin awesome now the name Hayabusa sounds familiar it's because they actually made some headlines just a few months ago by reaching orbit around the asteroid Raghu and dropping a couple of Landers on top of that but this was not the first time that they've done this this was Hayabusa 2 Hayabusa 1 launched in May of 2003 and went to the asteroid Itokawa and while it was not the first probe to go to an asteroid and study it it was the first to actually return a sample of that asteroid back to her and to do this they had to achieve another first which is actually landing on an asteroid and then flying away and in the process they were gonna drop a lander onto the asteroid and leave it there called Minerva Hayabusa recently asteroid in October 7th 2005 and here's where things started to go a little bit wrong the first thing that happened was they lost a couple of reaction wheels which made it more difficult to aim the probe they had to use their thrusters in lieu of that which made it a lot less accurate so when they went to release Minerva the lander the thrusters actually had pushed the spacecraft further away from the asteroid than they thought and the lander instead of hitting the asteroid just kind of floated off into space they did however successfully touched down on the asteroid Itokawa and were able to collect some samples basically by sort of kissing it with the collector and then flying away back to earth the tiny sample return capsule burned through the atmosphere over Australia on June 13 2010 and landed in the woomera prohibited area in the outback just as planned it's pretty remarkable the sample return provided about 1,500 grains from the asteroid that contained the minerals olivine pyroxene plagioclase and iron sulphide and suggested that the asteroid was part of a bigger asteroid that broke away so well the first Hayabusa mission didn't go perfectly to plan it was still a major win for JAXA and a big first for planetary exploration so the Hayabusa - mission was quickly green-lighted and where the Hayabusa won had won minerva Lander Hayabusa - has two minerva Landers the Minerva - one and the Minerva - two yeah and the Minerva - one lander actually has two Rovers on it the rover 1a and the rover 1b both of which to have various thermometers and cameras on them and Minerva - - carried the rover - that actually has more cameras and other instruments like accelerometers on it and there's actually another Lander on board called mascot which was a joint project between the German Aerospace agency and the French Space Agency CNES this one features a camera infrared spectrometer magnetometer and radiometer so four Landers total all of them rovers but these aren't like any Rovers you've ever seen before no one you think Rover you think like the moon rover you think the Curiosity rover you think wheels you think of something to move it across the surface of something for it to Rover right these don't have that in fact they just look like metal boxes no wheels no legs so how do they move around they hop they literally just hop across the surface the gravity of the asteroid is so light that wheels or legs or anything like that wouldn't have any way of actually gripping onto the surface I mean the attraction is almost more like static electricity so they move by actually rotating different masses inside the box and the torque that that applies is enough to make it flip into whatever direction they want it to go in that's crazy so yeah if you came upon this asteroid you would just see a bunch of boxes kind of bouncing around on it that's that's what it would look like Hayabusa 2 arrived at Ryu goo and Joon and release Minerva to one and its two Rovers on September 21st just eight or so weeks ago and then the process these Rovers took a series of supercool pictures including this one that I swear to God I want to do a science fiction movie just so I can use this as the poster this is the coolest image and just two weeks later the mascot probe successfully landed so they're three for three so far and the rover two on Minerva 2 - that's a lot of two's is supposed to be landing on July of 2019 and the plan is for Hayabusa 2 to make three different sample collections the last of which is the most dramatic because it's actually going to send an impactor to the surface and blow out a crater and then select from some samples from inside that crater so they sort of a subsurface collection as well and by the way every time they do one of these sample collections they use these target markers that they drop down to the surface that are reflective and it lets it know exactly how far away from the surface it is and on each one of these target markers are names of hundreds of people from the Planetary Society and Jackson's own fundraising campaigns who help pay to fund this project so the plan is for Hayabusa 2 to leave Ryuga in December of 2019 and return the samples to Earth in some time in 2020 which will make the second time Jack's has been able to actually successfully return samples from an asteroid and they're still the only agency in the world that's been able to do it although NASA does have a sample return probe called osiris-rex which just reaches asteroid called binnu in the last month or so but it's not supposed to return its sample to earth until 2023 as for what's next for JAXA their next big project landing on another much larger planetary body the moon the smart Lander for investigating moon or slim is currently scheduled to launch in 2021 and its goal is to demonstrate precision landing on the moon using software based on facial recognition technology the slim Lander will attempt the pinpoint landing near the Mariusz hills hole which is a lava tube that was found by the Kaguya orbiter their goal is a soft land in an area with only a 100 meter wide error range now to put that into perspective the Apollo 11 landing had a 20 kilometer wide error range and this is an important step toward colonizing the moon because if we're ever going to get to that point we're gonna have to learn how to do very accurate precision landing on the moon and we've landed lots of stuff on the moon before but that's still not something we've perfected so between their incredibly advanced robots and AI their rockets that are winning the race to the small and their interplanetary successes Jackson may not be earning all the headlines in the world but they are carving out a very important niche in space explorations so the JAXA I offer a well-deserved pie I've got plenty of links to articles and videos about what Jackson's got going on some of the programs are working on down the description below go check them out learn more about it
