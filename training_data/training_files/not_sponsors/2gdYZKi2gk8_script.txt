are you having fun he's having fun [Music] Oh [Applause] ever as floppy floppy hey everybody welcome to another episode of lineless for TV today I'm going to be taking vietze Olivia and Jenny for a walk and just letting them loose and letting them get up to whatever they want to get up to it is a fun part of of what I do really look forward to these walks as much as the Lions do I get excited they get excited and it's just really about letting these Lions get out into this bigger area running chasing and feeling like a lion alright so we here with the guys hello guys you ready hmm we ready to rock fight see yeah it seems like only by 8:00 she's ready to rock today hello my boy you are you excited about going to walk eh ah Lucas yeah melody boy oh whoa whoa oh yeah she comes why should this is Kate I ready she was just biding her time she knows what this means yeah [Music] okay cumberly [Music] oh boy [Music] you try not to get jumped on [Music] oh my gosh always got a laugh at the excitement that these lines show heavy ROI [Music] [Music] you guys know how to keep you fit [Music] Oh [Music] yeah baby boy [Music] [Music] your point oh no no no everyone floppy floppy whoa everyone's floppy floppy could be let's go okay let's go all the lines singing in the background Braca so sometimes it's nice to just zip the lip i can't just enjoy their noises of the bush and the quietness and you know it just becomes submersed in the lions world which is not very vocal like our world humans do tend to talk a lot and it's a gift or a curse [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] many of you have been asking me this question why do I do this rosebery noise and I'm like well I chose my wife what it Roseberry is Joshua now that's the sound you make like when you blow in a baby's belly or you you know so I can only assume that it's this sound the sound that I'm gonna make now and if I'm right if that is the sound then the reason why I make that sound is simple it is a it's a passive sound it's a appeasing sound it's a sound that the Lions respond to or something non-threatening it's an affection thing it's an appeasement thing it's a it's a hey it's a it's me I'm not I'm non-threatening not aggressive so it's all of those things that's it's a fiction perfect demonstration you can do one on their back it's really cool to let these lines do this I enjoy thoroughly as do they just exploring and sniffing and figuring things out [Music] livvie just clawing the tree sharpening the clause or sloughing off the old dead nail material keep her clothes nice and strong and shop and it's actually just every time I see that it's quite incredible to see how powerful those claws off I mean you could never do that with your nail probably couldn't even do that with enough and it just shows the strength and also with that she would have left a scent so any the predator coming posture is going to smell that and I can see somebody else's lift a claw mark there but that's an old one it's a lot of the time they reach quite high up into the tree onto the trunk to give their full maximum height so that would then also show arrival our big they are or how tall they are so there's a lot of this psychological warfare going on odd for us to fathom but the the chemicals that are floating around the since we say to people who just think about the all the sins that are wafting through the a art in nature and we so oblivious to them we've become so desensitized the urbanization has the old our senses but there is hope because when you do go back to the bush and you you start to submerge yourself in the bush you definitely start to hone your senses a lot more and you start to hear see smell even taste things that you didn't before just trying to cross over this precarious little ravine and I'm stepping on it ah a very small little branch because I don't want to go back that way because there's a whole bunch of Blackjacks and that's what I was afraid of anyway bullies well it ends off maybe some black Jack's wouldn't have been that bad hello go oh what's going [Music] sure getting gray look at that he's got a white tuft [Music] jinnie are you looking like looking like if salt and pepper going to greet your sister [Music] some lines have a spine that they would like a remnants of a claw at the tip of the tail some say that it could have been to do with some kind of prehensile tail that lines maybe once upon a time head and who knows no one really knows what the tuft at the end of a lion's tail is is for and why it's there but evolutionary there's probably some reason for it and because it's not a deleterious straight baton better by the same token there's another positive trait it can just get passed on from generation to generation so it's obviously the it's not a hindrance and it's not an advantage but we really don't know [Music] [Music] heavy boy oh he's a tired big monster or you're a tired monster and put your weary head in my lap there we go [Music] okay [Music] the pride is now gathered under the tree and we are all just relaxing a bit Sun is high it's pretty hot though it is autumn and there is a cool breeze it's still quite hot out there our autumn days tend to hit 25 sometimes 26 degrees over here super content and chilled cats they are very relaxed and very happy and while I'm talking there's a bloomin tick crawling over there yeah for their shoulder so again one of these pesky ticks that have an eye for nowadays and here I want that latching on to my Etsy although we do follow as you guys know we follow a very strict D ticking protocol and so the lines generally in the sanctuary are tick free who are you going something like that ease off again all right guys so I just like to take this opportunity to thank you all for watching line Whisperer TV you do want to become a member will put the link down below as well so all that enough to say guys is until next time from me by its Olivia journey bye [Music] you
