quintessential underdog pretty much yeah yeah now you get the whole tragic backstory in place and everything bullying and everything but a cool things I like the whole super ugh 80% of the world has superpowers great gaming but so far like he's the only one I mean we see like everyday people yeah but yeah I guess he's the only one in this whole school that doesn't have a power right right so that's that's rough he doesn't have a quirk so in this way our cash is interesting um so let's see we're just taking some um either ku midoriya uh buddies Green Lantern guys come on and it's almost pink with pinky toes is from comic yeah it's all because of his pinky toe yeah and in what so like I kind of like oh it was just a preview for the next one yeah next is father yellow see its curator
