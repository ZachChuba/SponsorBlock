yo what is going on guardians and welcome back to another destiny 2 gameplay video hey in this video i'm going to be giving my thoughts on the travelers chosen with the catalyst it received this season now i got this catalyst banged out on the first day of the season so i've been at it for a while now and at that time all over twitter and in my stream chat uh kept telling me and people in tournament tell me they were raving about the catalyst and how incredible it was and now while this sidearm is potentially my favorite weapon in all of destiny 2 and while i have almost 9 000 kills in this sidearm so far i'm going to offer a different perspective on this catalyst i think to what others are started and now it's time to get back to destiny okay let's get into this catalyst i'm assuming most if not all of you still playing destiny have had this catalyst drop at this point it drops on playlist activity completions so you've probably got it at this point so getting your hands on this thing is pretty simple so let's list the things this catalyst does for the weapon when you apply the catalyst to the traveler's chosen the weapon gets two extra bullets in the magazine bumping in up to 17 rounds the second thing that it does is it gives the traveler's chosen osmosis which is a perk that changes the weapon from kinetic to whatever element your subclass is when you toss your grenade it will retain that change until it is stowed and the last unique thing that it does is it applies full auto to the sidearm so if you hold the trigger down it will just continue to fire at its max rpm additionally you get the benefit of being able to create orbs of light on rapid final blows now on paper that sounds like a lot so let's tackle each of those changes one at a time starting with the mag increase now the traveler's chosen has an optimal ttk uh time to kill of 0.6 seconds and that can be achieved with four headshots or three headshots and one body shot on a guardian with low resilience that's mega fast that's a really fast ttk if you hit all body shots then your ttk is a flat one second still pretty decent with a 15 round magazine you're looking at being able to comfortably duel two guardians before reloading and your reload will be buffed because of your stacks of gathering light after those kills you could stretch that in theory to three kills but you gotta be scary accurate in order to make that happen now with 17 rounds in the magazine you can comfortably duel three opponents if you allow for five to six bullets for each target now that doesn't happen often but it does happen from time to time so basically this weapon is going to allow you to pump out more damage for longer periods of time before reloading and that absolutely matters even if it's just a couple of bullets when you do the math that damage really matters so the extra rounds in the mag is an excellent buff from this catalyst that's two thumbs up from me moving on to osmosis osmosis opens up some creative opportunities for pvp including things like battle harmony or verdi's brow and even some charged with light options but i'm gonna level with you this perk sucks in pvp leveraging it means doing some meticulous setup but uh taking advantage of it means dumping a grenade and then being forced to stay committed to the sidearm since the effects of osmosis go away when you swap to a different weapon and i mean i've tried the battle harmony with it honestly it's just not worth it i'm much better off just using an energy sidearm of my subclass element right instead of not having to do all the extra setup and maintaining the freedom when i use a different slider i maintain my freedom to stow the weapon and not be penalized for it sometimes you need to put the gun away depending on your situation and the opponent's distance so this perk is a hard pass for me it is rarely helpful and when it is helpful it's not in my opinion worth the trade-off of your other alternatives it has some utility in pve but frankly no one is going to run this weapon over a mythic class or a thousand voices or something that's gonna dish out some serious damage to combatants or help with ad control conversely right osmosis is a two thumbs down from me on the catalyst moving on to full auto i'm gonna give it to you straight i hate it this perk makes me miss shots and i hate it sometimes the weapon will discharge a second bullet even when you barely tap the trigger so you weren't planning on that bullet you didn't dictate its exact moment of discharge on on hit scan weapons that's kind of important and you now have to wait for another bullet i hate it i wish i could actually turn full auto off i like my semi-automatic weapons to remain semi-automatic i want to dictate the exact moment each round is fired so i know exactly when and where it's going to go it's the same reason i hate full auto on pulse rifles and i never fire them in full auto when they have it i know this is a preference thing and many players love having full auto on this sidearm and others and that's totally fine but personally i hate it and i wish bungie had given me the option to turn it off so for added perks from the catalyst this catalyst is a solid one out of three for me i love having the extra bullets in the magazine but osmosis i could take it or leave it as it has zero effect on my experience with the weapon of pvp and i see full auto actually as a detriment which has hurt my overall performance with the gun if it were up to me i'd make it so that you could toggle full auto on and off so for me the biggest utility of the catalyst uh the biggest utility that it provides is the 17 round mag and the ability to create orbs of light meaning that i can more frequently leverage my favorite charged with light mods like high energy fire and surprise attack for that charged magazine buff i'm super happy that this weapon finally has a catalyst and i'm loving having the kill tracker and leveraging these mods in my build more frequently but the catalyst alone is a little underwhelming for the record it's still one of my favorite guns in the game if not my favorite and finding creative ways of leveraging those gathering light stacks is super rewarding and it adds so much to my overall pvp experience i'm super grateful to have the catalyst in the game now and i'm looking forward to grinding my kill count even higher every week on this thing thanks for watching the video if you enjoyed it please feel free to drop a like on the video thanks to all of
