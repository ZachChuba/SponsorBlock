hello this is chef john from
foodwishes.com with lomo saltado that's right i've never been a big stir
fry guy but when it comes to lomo saltado
i definitely make an exception okay first of all it's peruvian
and i love to eat anything peruvian but it's also a stir fry that besides the
meat and the vegetables also believe it or not features french
fries i know it sounds crazy and it is but it is also incredibly delicious and
truly unique and this is how i like to make mine and
what i have here is just over a pound of top sirloin steak
and all we're going to do here is simply slice this the short way into about
quarter inch strips and sure if you wanted to splurge you
can use a nicer cut like a filet or a new york strip
or something like that all right some people even use skirt steak which would
be very nice in this but top sirloin is fairly tender and
pretty affordable so i do think it's a good choice for this
so i went ahead and sliced up both those steaks and then we'll transfer that meat
into a mixing bowl at which point we'll do a very very
simple marinade of a little bit of soy sauce
and just a touch of white sugar and then we'll go ahead and give that a thorough
mixing at which point we'll want to transfer
this into the fridge for at least an hour
all right longer is okay but we want to do that for a minimum of at least 60
minutes so we will pop that in the fridge and
then move on to take a little peek at the rest of the ingredients
which will include some red and green onions some garlic some ginger and
cilantro as well as some roma tomatoes and some
beautiful orange peppers which by the way are supposed to be
these very specific peruvian peppers called ahi amarillo
but since those are hard to find we're going to use a bell pepper plus one
habanero and when you combine that very mild
bittersweet flavor of the bell pepper with that fruity and very fiery habanero
we're gonna end up with something very very close
oh and as far as prepping our aroma tomatoes we only want to use the meatier
parts so what i like to do is go around making
three cuts like this which is going to leave us with just
that center core which we will discard and then if we want we can deseed these
or simply just slice those as is or in my case just make a half-hearted
attempt to get the seeds out and then what we'll do once those have
been seeded not seeded or partially seeded
is we'll cut each of those in half to make six pieces per tomato
and by the way i only showed three in the shot of the ingredients but in the
spirit of full disclosure i did end up cutting one more up
for four total and that's it once our veggies are set
we can move on to the last major and most bizarre components
some french fries which i'm going to cook in some olive oil set over
medium-high heat in this non-stick pan and for this i like to use the frozen
crinkle cut fries but any french fry will do
and while you could deep fry these or simply bake them according to the
package directions i really do like to do these in a pan
like this since it's definitely going to be quicker than baking
and also i think we're going to be able to get them crispier this way
plus by doing them in the pan like this they will actually absorb more oil
which usually doesn't sound like a good thing but here i think it actually
provides for a better texture in the final dish and then what we'll do
once those are cooked long enough is transfer those to a sheet pan which
for some reason i lined with a paper towel
and then what we'll do is pop those in a warm oven and reserve them until needed
okay so our fries are set and then we'll take that exact same pan
and place it over high heat and we'll drizzle in a few tablespoons of olive
oil and we will wait patiently for it to
become smoking hot as in literally starting to smoke and
then once that happens we'll go ahead and start
browning our meat which we are really supposed to do in nice small batches
and please feel free to do that but i'm going to show you a completely
inappropriate absolutely horrible technique for doing
the same thing involving doing all the meat at once
which is going to be easier and faster but if you do it wrong the meat's going
to come out terrible so pay attention because what we're going to do is place
our median and spread it out and we'll let that sear on high heat for just a
couple minutes getting as much browning as we can on
that bottom surface but as you'll see after just a few short
moments you're going to notice a lot of moisture coming out
and as soon as that happens while the meat is still pink we must quickly
remove that to a bowl leaving all those juices in the pan at
which point we'll simply let those reduce all the way down to nothing
and then as soon as all that moisture has been evaporated and all we have left
in the pan are those beautiful caramelized meat drippings
we will quickly toss our meat back in being careful not to transfer too much
of the juices in the bowl back into the pan
and then what we'll do is grab a spatula and simply toss this meat around for
about 30 seconds to a minute and what's going to happen is all that
amazing goodness browned onto the bottom of the pan
is going to be deglazed by the moisture on the meat and basically stick to
it so that when we pull this off and scrape it back into the bowl
it's pretty much going to look and feel the same as if we'd done this in small
batches and is it exactly as good no but is it
so close that in a dish like this no one will notice the difference
yes much to the chagrin of culinary instructors all over the world
since like i said it is absolutely horrible technique but it works as long
as you get that meat in and out of the pan quickly
and that's it once our beef is done we can move on to final production
so we will take that same dirty pan and place it over high heat
and add a little more olive oil and we will toss in all our onions and peppers
along with a nice big pinch of salt and we'll saute that for just a few minutes
or until our onions and peppers just start to soften up
okay we don't want them soft at this point we just don't want them hard
then once we think that's looking good we will add our garlic and ginger
and we will cook that stirring for a few minutes just to take off that raj
and then once that's set next up we'll go ahead and add our tomatoes
which we are not going to cook very long okay we are not trying to make a tomato
sauce so we're just going to cook those
stirring for a few minutes until they just start to soften and they
just begin to release their juices and then as soon as that happens we will
pour in a big splash of white vinegar as well as a few tablespoons of soy
sauce and we'll also this time add our meat back in
with of course any and all accumulated juices
and we'll give that a quick stir to combine and yes that does look good
and just wait until you smell this and that's it once that's been stirred
together we can finish this off by tossing in our chopped cilantro
and our nice crispy hopefully still warm french fries
and then we'll mix and stir and toss and turn until those fries are coated in all
these amazing juices oh and for the record some people
actually serve the french fries on the side
so they don't get soggy but from what i'm told the real players always mix the
french fries in of course having said that you decide i
mean you are after all the major domo of your lomo but for me serving the
french fries on the side with this would be like the same thing as serving
a poutine with the french fries separated from the gravy
i mean come on we're not doing that and that's it
as soon as everything's been mixed together we can turn off the heat and
give it a taste for seasoning and i decided might need a little more
salt and i was going to add some cayenne but the heat from that habanero was
perfect and then once we're happy with it we'll go ahead and serve it up
believe it or not traditionally next to some steamed white rice
oh yeah the rare and exotic carb on carb action
but anyway i served that up and did a little bit of food styling
very little and then finished up with a couple sprigs of cilantro
and that's it my lomo salado was ready to enjoy
so i went ahead and grabbed a fork and dug right in and that my friends is just
a party on a plate i mean there's so much going on here i
don't even know where to start just so many big beautiful bold flavors
okay we're talking a little bit sweet a little bit sour a little bit salty a
little bit spicy it's just one of those very addictive
dishes that once you start eating you can't stop sticking your fork into
and while i will admit it's very strange to put french fries in a stir-fry
for some reason they totally work and probably because they absorb all the
other flavors from the other ingredients and yes the first time i had this i
could not understand the rice but that also inexplicably pairs really
nicely and i will admit i've not done a ton of
research about the history of this dish alright i do know it was influenced by
chinese immigrants to peru but even though i don't know that much
about it i will take an educated guess and say that this was probably invented
by someone that was drunk all right i just get that feeling but
anyway that's it my take on lomo satado i totally
understand if this seems a little bit crazy
but what would be even crazier is you not making this
which is why i really do hope you give this a try soon
