hey guys it's Chelsea from the financial the end of the video to find out how to win $100 and this week I wanted to talk to you about your brain because he or she is a huge jerk basically one of the biggest things that TFD that we like to talk about is how so much of our money lives are not really just a numbers game and we often hear about getting better with money in terms of like just do a budget and make the numbers make sense spend less than you earn and it will work out but everyone who's ever been in trouble with money and honestly anyone even who hasn't probably knows on some level that how good you are with money at any given time is going to be enormous ly impacted by your own personal history your psychology the world around you the messages you're receiving your friends and so many factors that have nothing on the surface to do with just the numbers and for many people sticking to a budget can be incredibly hard even when we know what we need to do with our money making that leap from knowing what's right and doing what's right can feel impossible and we've all seen breakdowns of people who are making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year yet are reduced to living paycheck to paycheck because they can't get out of the way of their own lifestyle inflation and some psychologists like Bradley Clontz think that it really boils down to the brain according to Clontz there are four main ways people think about money what he dubs money scripts the four types are money avoidance the belief that having money and being rich are inherently bad money status the belief that your worth as a person is tied to your bank account numbers money worship the belief that having money will solve all of your problems and money vigilance the belief that you should be frugal safe and discreet a sense of nervousness around money almost and even if you may not know which of these archetypes tend to really fit your relationship with money on a more broad level neuroscientists tend to agree that our brains are not super well equipped to handle money or even really to understand money our brains tend to be very good at things that are black and white like run away from that fire or eat when you're hungry but when it comes to more Nebu concepts around which there are tons of possibilities and no real clear sense of right and wrong things like money and how to handle it our brains are much less well equipped for the task which is probably a large part of why 8 out of 10 Americans experience some form of money anxiety unfortunately there's no hard and fast answer for everyone about how to get out of your brains way when it comes to money but there are specific patterns and habits that we can recognize and figure out how to stop preemptively or at the very least ignore and let pass us by so that we can be more in control of our choices and less impacted by all these external factors or these more subconscious / base instincts that are not necessarily rational when it comes to how we should handle our money so without further ado here are 4 ways to combat your own brain and get better with your money goals number one is aspirational spending so it is no surprise that it's a very base instinct for us to want what others have let's imagine that you are early man and you're out there you know I don't know if this is pre like commercial farming but anyway you have like a crop and your neighbor has like a really cool looking tool that's like getting him way more crop and you're like give me that tool and maybe you'll even kill him to get the tool this was rougher times anyway long story short there is a good reason for us to covet things that seem aspirational on a very base level often having these more aspirational or unique or intelligent or highly technological developments can mean a higher chance of survival and a higher chance of prospering and emulating others can also teach us really good skills like oh this person is very good at communicating I'm going to emulate the way that they communicate in order to further my own chances you might be able to pick up an interesting skill or learn a way to do something better the point is that peer influence can be very useful but there are a couple reasons why especially in today's world that instinct can really turn against us first and foremost we are now exposed to millions of lives that we never would have come in contact with in a different era pick up Instagram and you have a literal cornucopia of people to be jealous of and people to make you feel insecure about yourself it's causing you to want things that you may not have even been aware of or things that have nothing to do with your own life and because in places like pop culture or social media often the goal is to present oneself as happy fulfilled successful it's so easy to look at this item let's say that an Instagram influencer might have and immediately associated even on a subconscious level with being a happier person and this is again not a new thing it's called mimetic desire and basically it means wanting something because someone else has it because their ownership of the thing gives that thing value and there's actually a system in our brain that does this it's called the mirror neuron system and basically it consists of two parts of the brain that fire up under two conditions when you're performing an action and when you see someone else performing an action basically our brains trick us into thinking that we're doing what someone else is doing when we see them do it our value system then gives that action or the focus of that action like a cute handbag a mental boost neuroscientists have demonstrated this in very simple experiments like when they show subjects a video of someone selecting between two pieces of candy when the participants are asked what candy they prefer they overwhelmingly want the candy that was chosen by the person on the video even though that candy may not have necessarily even been their favorite flavor of candy the point is this is something inherent in how we view the world and how we perceive value but since we are now surrounded by these images and have thousands of opportunities a day to see these items that might otherwise exist in a vacuum for us presented as someone else's object of desire it becomes harder and harder to distinguish between what we intrinsically want and what we just see someone else enjoying and one really easy way to combat this if for example you're scrolling through a social media feed and seeing an item and feeling a strong desire for that item is to wait at least 24 hours first and foremost so you can let that initial pang of aspiration subside but second and perhaps more importantly go and view that item totally isolated without all of the styling without the person holding it without all of the mental associations you're making with that friend or influencer celebrity who's somehow inherently endorsing that item try to see it on its own in a vacuum and decide based on that if it's something you really want the more we can try and remove that feeling of I want this because they want this the more we can start to see what is actually worth us spending on number two is marketing warfare one thing that we all have to get better about being honest with ourselves about is how much what we want to buy or when we feel compelled to buy is driven by very very clear psychological tricks to make us feel that compulsion for example have you ever felt compelled to buy something because you got a free sample or you were offered a special deal or because you were maybe interacting with a sales person who's taken time to help you these are all very distinct strategies that companies will use to make sure that people feel as compelled as possible to buy something beyond just all of the advertisements that were bombarded with on a daily basis the path to getting someone actually into a store or onto a site and then buying that item is even more loaded with all of these various obstacles for our brain to get over for example with that salesperson they were so nice you don't want to be rude and hurt their feelings and not buy something or what about if they gave you a free gift well now you owe them something or what about the person that's giving you that really good advice or a good deal you now have trust with them you don't want to betray that trust or maybe they're even making an exceptional offer for you they're probably not we are social creatures by nature who function on these implicit social contracts so we don't want to feel that we have somehow disrupted that by not making a purchase so all of these little pathways are set up to make sure that we feel as compelled to complete the sale as possible even if we don't really want the product FOMO is another marketing trick that is used heavily to make sure that we feel a sense of urgency when it comes to buying I don't know about you but several years ago I started to feel like every single time I went into a store that used to basically have two sales a year everything was on sale for some reason and even if it wasn't on sale actively like on the display you could probably use some kind of a coupon code in order to finish the purchase and get a discount it used to have to be that I would have to wait and plan for the big sales at stores like j.crew or Banana Republic or loft aka the three stores I shop at in order to make all of my yearly purchases and now there's basically always a big sale going on at one or all of those stores and that perception that things are on sale way more now is not in your mind retailers are increasingly baking in sales discounts and deals into their pricing so that you always feel as if you are both getting a good deal and have to hit that sale while it's happening it creates that sense of urgency that FOMO about potentially missing the sale and lowers your mental barrier to making the purchase now this doesn't mean that you should never take advantage of a sale but it also means that you should be much more wary about what that sale actually means and how time-sensitive it really is number three is retail therapy now let's be clear you are not imagining it there is a real therapeutic effect when it comes to shopping but it's something that can easily get out of hand now obviously if you are one of those people who tends to be more vigilant when it comes to money you're not necessarily going to be so susceptible to spending as an automatic therapeutic option but for many of us especially those of us who tend to have that money worship or fall prey to that sense of aspiration it can be a very easy place to turn when you're looking for that quick boost of serotonin but it's important to understand what your brain is actually going through when you're self soothing by shopping first it's important to remember that from the moment you start thinking about that purchase your brain is already starting to think of you that way you're visualizing yourself in that new outfit or with that beautiful new redone living room or even with that book you've been dying to read this can stave off anxiety and make you feel automatically a bit more competent or put together because you're starting to add it to your mental picture of yourself and so that visualization alone can be an easy antidote to stress and shopping can also provide a hint of creativity because it uses your imagination even something as simple as a new track can can allow you to imagine how much better you're going to be about sorting out your recyclables and taking out the trash but for someone whose brain tends toward the artistic for example planning a whole new outfit or a gallery wall can give you that same rush of creativity and imagination that a day at a museum or a very fascinating film might so by understanding that it's more than just the actual purchase itself that's giving our brain that soothing rush you can start to find solutions to these various itches that don't require scratching via swiping your card yes occasionally making a purchase not in a great frame of mind is okay and will happen but there must be some outlets that meet those same needs without requiring spending so it's important to interrogate why you're stressed and break down from there what else you can do to meet those needs for example you've had an extremely stressful day at the office where you feel like you're not being listened to or your work isn't valuable or it's super mundane you might want to have a really creative imaginative moment by buying something really fun that makes you feel out of your day to day what are a few other things that could meet those same needs well as I mentioned going to see that really beautiful film or spending an hour at a gallery can stimulate those creative and fulfilling parts of your brain or what if you want to imagine yourself differently because you feel like you're in a total rut making a really concrete plan for an exciting project or taking several concrete steps toward a specific goal you've been thinking about can give you that same boost of aspirational competence without having to buy yourself that really chic put together outfit basically interrogate what your brain is looking to escape and what it's looking to feel so you can start to find budget-friendly ways of making yourself feel that way without going to the store lastly number four is the abstract versus the concrete so we've obviously talked a lot about ways that external factors can tap into the basest parts of us but what about how our brain actually thinks about things the calls that are coming from inside the house so to speak basically our brains aren't really that good at comprehending abstract things this abstract reasoning is something that is obviously unique to humans but it's also our most advanced way of thinking and just because we're the ones who do it doesn't mean we're inherently very good at it things that are concrete that are tangible and physical and have very clear cause and effect still feel much more real to us than things that don't for example this is why it can feel much harder to actually take out $200 worth of cash and put it on a counter than to swipe a card that is taking that same $200 out of an account that you can't physically see once you physically remove those bills from your wallet that money is no longer there for you to use and you can see that but that $200 that you took out of your account still exists in the ether until you actually check your bank account which if you tend to be avoidant is something you may not do very often and even once you do check that bank account it's still just an abstract number that doesn't really mean anything until your brain takes a minute to contextualize it and while debit cards can get closer to making your brain feel like this money is very real because obviously it's directly linked to your account and you can see that money removed immediately credit cards are even more difficult for our brains to manage which is why so many of us including formerly myself have such a hard time staying out of trouble with credit cards credit cards actively make us feel that we have more than we really do because our brain will easily tack that credit limit onto our actual account making us feel like we have three thousand dollars in our account plus two thousand dollars we can spend on our card so there are four five thousand dollars when really if you're using your credit card properly and paying the full balance down at the end of the month you still just have that $3,000 because you have to be able to fully pay for it but because that bill often won't come until a date in the future which again our brains have a much harder time picturing and making real than we do the moment we're living in it further increases the degree to which that money doesn't quite feel like a real obligation so there's very little pain in swiping that card just the pleasure of making that great purchase that that trustworthy salesperson convinced you was a good idea even when it comes to things like future savings goals it's no surprise to most of that our brain has a much harder time delaying gratification toward a goal that's abstract to us than it does making those immediate joy-giving purchases on a very base level we could die at any time so that future self is a lot harder to invest in than the current self which has feelings and beautiful things surrounding it and is hungry or stressed or has all of these various things that we're going to want to tend to right away so how do we combat this by making those abstract financial concepts as real to us as possible for example never have a savings account just labeled by some random account number always make it real words that are about the specific savings goal that those accounts are working toward start tracking your goals with other means like using sheets or graphs or pieces of paper things that make your brain feel like they're real and satisfying more than just an abstract number keep pictures and visual cues of the goal you're working toward don't just think about the house that you're saving up for start to create an inspiration board with images of the home that you want to create if you're using cards force yourself to check your accounts as often as possible to make sure that every time you're making that spend that real hit - the amount of money available to you starts to feel tangible if working with cards is difficult try to pay in cash as often as possible at least until you can start building up that association in your mind of purchase made money lost the more your finances and even the money in your account can feel like a very real physical tangible part of your life rather than just some abstract concept the more you will be better equipped to make good decisions about it so long story short our brains aren't inherently very good at dealing with money and with all these external factors weighing on us it can become more and more difficult to separate what is real from what is just a trick being played on us but the good news is that even just by watching videos like this one you are doing yourself a huge favor to relieve that money stress you might be feeling and therefore prevent yourself from making a lot of those stressed-out decisions in fact researchers have found that just asking for help with money results in a 20% increase in Oh all feelings of relaxation and recognition around the subject so yes talking about money is often half the the link in our description to enter as always guys thank you for watching and don't forget to hit the subscribe button and to come back every
