make your next move with Squarespace guys I have to tell you a very very funny story that happened a few months ago and I mean it would be funny if it weren't so sad and if so much money wasn't lost so a few months ago Josh was at a theme park and while he was on one of his favorite rollercoasters his phone somehow fell out of his pocket and he lost it forever now just put on a happy face and took it like a real champ but I know deep down I knew my big brother was struggling I'm fine so Josh had to go five whole days without a phone while he waited for his replacement to be hand delivered to him and I don't know if you've ever tried to go like two hours without your smartphone but it's a little weird now there are certain things you just kind of get used to like waking up in the morning Josh didn't have his phone to check as soon as he woke up eating a meal suddenly felt really lonely and going to the potty was now a chore and a lot shorter I don't even watch out of the bathroom anymore so maybe it was the 500th time that Josh reached for his empty pocket or perhaps it was just the constant nagging emptiness he felt but at some point Josh finally realized I think I'm addicted to my phone we have a winner oh well did I win a free-falling nope you're still out several hundred dollars it just got me thinking about how reliant we are on these devices and I don't mean like in a practical way like it's good to have a phone you know when your car breaks down I don't mean that kind of reliant okay okay I mean we're reliant as in we've rewired our brains over the last few years to think we have to have these phones on us at all times staring at them constantly feeling incomplete if they're ever out of our sight I mean really just like push your phone in a drawer okay walk out of the room for like an hour that feeling you feel is called a dick but why why is our default resting state six like most of the times we're staring out our phones we're not even doing anything anyway so why is this normal now here we find the human male staring intently at his listening device he can stare at it for minutes or even hours without looking up and announed a female approaches staring intently at her listening device at no point do these two creatures ever make eye contact and their only interaction is to look at a funny meme on the listening device here's the thing guys it's great to have the Internet at our fingertips okay I'm just saying I'm trying to make an effort to not just idly stare at this thing every chance I get I mean one day I'm gonna die okay that's the truth I cannot imagine a scenario where in my final moments I'm thinking this only regret is that I would have spent more time scrolling through the facebook app praying to God before a new notification why I just don't see it if anything I'm worried that I'm going to get old and have regrets about the time I spent on on this thing here but I'm trying to keep out of my hands right now honestly that kind of scares me actually I mean I'm only on this earth for a very limited amount of time I know we've all heard this but it's true and I don't think you know this thing enhances my life that much putting it back in my pocket if anything I think that it keeps me from living it so Josh and I are making a commitment right here right now on messy Mondays we are getting rid of our phones Josh give me your phone yes no do not argue with me yes good plan one I can get it in my contract so people are going to call it's hypocrites if we don't do this right now okay I can with it no no you know you look that's it we're in this together give me your phone so I am making a commitment right here right now on Matthew Mondays that I will be getting rid of my phone oh wow okay um how do you feel I feel like a human being like a like a real man Wow yeah okay Oh real quick uh I forgot about this can you can you text Sarah for me and tell her that like I don't have fun anymore because she's like out and I'm going to she's gonna check me out later oh so okay actually can I can I just use your phone work wait I can call her I don't know give me your phone I'll just just give me the phone let me give you this all stay next move at squarespace.com slash cow that squarespace.com slash cow next week on messy mondays nature takes a dark turn while gathering footage of the human species our cameraman came across something truly spectacular what was once thought only a myth now appears to be true a creature so elusive that even this narrator can barely believe it himself here it is our first video evidence the Bigfoot kid [Music]
