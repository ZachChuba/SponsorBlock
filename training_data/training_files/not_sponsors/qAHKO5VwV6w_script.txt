honest straight up you don't want the part but I stopped eating greasy foods for like a week and then like a week later I just don't want it anymore that's pretty good I can see there's a nice party tool and I wonder if it can actually like cook something maybe throwing hang on that yeah here's my question can you modify it to go really fast just like with that baby yeah so essentially you know someone comes over let me get a slice and you just like speed it up in a schuster slice at them oh no let me see whoa Robert out of it but I love your live-action rendition yeah I got you bro all right my mouth rate to the dope yeah I'm gonna say this honestly you know but I'll say the food's a dope alright next product windproof umbrella the weather will never defeat you ever again when you've got this wind proof umbrella it's ergonomic design prevents it from becoming inverted even on the windiest days yeah many different colors available to suit all tastes so this might actually be kind of helpful I mean we get crazy winds but not while it's raining but in some areas where like the winds are crazy your umbrella does like flip up let's take a portion out let's take a poll we're the last time we'll go one by one was the last time you use an umbrella that's what I just said here it's not as relevant to us but in like other parts of the world where it's like consistently raining on them this book could be helpful why don't they just move yeah yeah Seattle's not the place to live you don't like rain Michael add info hey this is my product is it bad luck to open this indoors asking for a friend looks like a bird wow this looks like a blackbird you know like the the sr-71 okay nerd it just looks like a Dementors just gave yourself seven years bad luck like eat some salt this is my parenting tactic I have a kid in the cycling yeah you're gonna do it again boom seven years seven years of bad luck seven years of spankings right Michael you want to go test this via some intense wind yeah let's take it outside own as a leaf blower hi guys a bag of orange base and so I got the umbrella here tan man is coming with the leaf blower we're gonna see how well this futuristic balloon will hold up if it inverts one you're a two-bit doubt guys asleep flower sounds really intense but it doesn't blow it's like I could probably just do it myself ready see an umbrella do anything like that but it doesn't do what it said it says supposed to be wind resistant yo Michael show them Instagram and on show them versus reality Instagram reality well this leafblower sucks more than it blows and this thing folds under pressure my n1 plus portable two and one electric scarf warming and cooling okay now I'm curious what's a warming air conditioner what do you mean you condition the air you can condition it hot or cold really that's conditioning it your condition your hair that looks at it no that's why he's balding dude are in the paint there yeah sorry what are those Dawson's Creek oh whoa he's plugged into something it's easy to take on the go it just permanently looks like his headphones on that he's not wearing you have to plug it in Oh trash best way to cool down body temperature while doing outdoor activities what is that you really want to stop me run to be like ah that's it alright let's just let's have this maybe the car maybe I will mine and test it out cool packaging you sold that for me right ah his head's way too big it's like a little chef now oh it's yellow we love a racing yellow imagine my Honda Civic doesn't match the hoverboard

plug it in there's no battery on this that's why what if this gets so hot that it burns your neck and you just are branded they just have their like brand name on the inside so we are we're lit up here your best friend on the party we are lit up here we're gonna put on cold it's cold do you feel it it's pretty quiet I must say it's cold is it loud what is allowed no dad's kind of old sometimes you might yeah there's so much pressure my head didn't even know I'd say this would be more futuristic if you didn't need that cable like if it was just all within that and that was it it's I'm gonna try dude it's warming up is it as hot as I don't know the chemistry in the room right now Oh and hot no not can be I feel like this could work it's really dumb looking and you have to walk around the battery but you know if you wanna I mean what's the use case though like you forget your jacket but you don't forget this like what I'm gonna take the job it doesn't function and be a little bit better if you just didn't need the cord I mean it's pretty like that's a new modern-day scarf that's a nice product next product all right so we got a futuristic looking vacuum tube speaker right he has you a common sight let's watch this little video first aesthetic all-white I like it by Michael Bergdahl all right so they change different colors on the insides I'm sure you can set it to one if

test mountain mode cool so plugs in and then it cooks up to bluetooth more wires ah with the bass right here San Siro you see what the heck is that take this yeah obviously what I didn't even have

stage are you gonna cut it litleo Lupe Fiasco these bank robber I don't know about you but that that was not good audio so hold on you've been only hearing trouble and that's put us in so here's the

it was here and now it's the past guess what AGS what does that stand for all good sugar all good sugar oh good good world's most advanced wireless laser projection Bluetooth virtual keyboard and mouse for iPhone iPad smartphone tablets so ideally this would be pretty cool what do you mean ideally is it not cool well like ideally if this functions well it will be sick but if it's poorly then it stops address riddle me this when you're typing it's projecting it onto your fingers no doesn't stay under your fingers so they should make one where it's a table and it projects under so then you're on top and you gotta bring around a table about well I I was gonna make yeah that's an Asian make on I bet you can't even see it in the light yeah that looks like trash right there it's for people with dim rooms I'm assuming a discard this is perfect for you because you're sick so you want to touch anything physically you're just touching a light I hate that noise there's a laggy just doesn't what is the goal of this missus half the things they're convenience I feel like I'm on a typewriter like surrounded by monkeys hey let this monkey give it a try see I type relatively quickly as you can see this is with me right now right holy moly this is the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life broke it dog yeah it stopped working dude and it's not even in show you out type did you have to hit one key at a time and if you don't do it like that it's like I'm just not even gonna do anything all right listening sucks yeah that's super finicky and janky but how cool the future be if it didn't it's not made for the future guys next product beach duel breakfast sandwich maker timer silver guys look at these eggs nasty that biscuit doesn't add up here about biscuits not math oh they had a little pepper is it yeah this looks good so the whole goal here is that you can pretty much put everything on separate layers I'm gonna cook it and pull these puppies out of imagining and then boom if that works I'll eat my shorts hi Elise hi she looks like she's handcuffed to the table she's dripped in Christmas colors she seems like she's forced to be here cooking plate and top ring add an eggs with the other piece of bread and clue what you put them on top that quick wise I don't believe it she doesn't have a soul I don't trust her those muffins and not nutritious well Elise we're gonna listen to you here we're gonna add this to card and if you lied to us I swear Lee better watch out on this agree on this slide right number batter okay so we greased this we greased this puppy up let's do what she says all right so boom first level you're gonna put your first bun right a man follow along first bun done level oh wait I need the the ham don't think this is right cheese but we're gonna go along with it no good I know you like cheese I feel like cheese would be better no this is a good spot for cheese I guess and then we're gonna close that boom no I don't you guys know I'm an expert and then according to at least you put the bun on it that's what homegirl did what you know psycho that doesn't mean that's what she did we all saw it Oh yep and the yolks leaking out the side of your kids yeah a few moments later all right Oh spicy boy my eggs definitely not cooked Oh yikes it's jiggling still okay wait let's just like tick oh oh no oh Ali slide Oh No the preheat just won huh reset this will do a minute hey Michael see how your egg turned out dawg it's stuck in there all right it's cooked it's cooked so slide why that baby yeah I mean it cooked me an egg it could melt in my cheese my ham still looks a little questionable no I don't want to start though three two one come on kids I mean it's an egg all right the product works it does its job it is pretty efficient we were just a little bit inefficient and not letting it preheat at first yeah but once that was done properly then you set the timer you only took a minute for the egg to cook so
