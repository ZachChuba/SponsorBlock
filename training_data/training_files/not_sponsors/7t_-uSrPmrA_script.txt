what's up wisecrack jared again director ari aster stunned and delighted horror fans with his 2018 familial horror film hereditary so expectations for his follow-up were understandably high and according to contemporary horror king jordan peele astor more than met those expectations creating quote the most idyllic horror film of all time now peel enjoys his horror film served with a healthy side of social commentary and deep meaning as we've covered in our videos on get out and us so his response got us thinking is there something meaningful going on in this gnarly vision of the swedish countryside or is it all bear carcasses and no substance let's find out in this wisecrack edition on midsomar or midsummer i'm just going to call it midsummer deep or dumb and as always spoilers ahead alright let's dive into a recap midsummer introduces us to 20-something dany and her douchey boyfriend christian who's about to dump her but when dany's sister kills herself and her parents christian can't exactly peace out motivated by guilt he unenthusiastically invites her to tag along with him and his anthropology grad school bros on a trip to sweden for a special once every 96 years mid-summer festival they arrive at an idyllic swedish commune and almost immediately gets weird two old people jump off a cliff in a harakiri esque ritual this chick puts a pube in christian's pie and people dance and moan while tripping balls these british people are reasonably like wear out and promptly disappear has anyone seen connie things get progressively creepier and the grad school bros are subsequently killed one by one in creatively horrifying fashion but things are going comparatively better for dany who wins an all-girls stone dance competition gets crowned may queen and is celebrated by the whole community then christian gets roped into a weird sex ritual that dany sees through a keyhole but she doesn't have long to mope because there's about to be a cool human sacrifice and she gets to select the ninth person to be set on fire we patiently wait your verdict she picks you guessed it christian danny smiles as he and his fellow sacrificial lamb humans burn the end to figure out if this film is deep or not we first have to decipher astor's bloody depiction of a midsummer festival it's important to note that this film is not overly concerned with total anthropological fidelity midsummer though an iconic swedish holiday is not a bloodbath where grandpas jump off cliffs or hapless foreigners are put in funny hats and burn to a crisp according to poe tid holm author of the book celebrating the swedish way midsummer is all about celebrating summer eating herring drinking aqua beet and staying up late it is a light and happy tradition he notes that it is held to welcome summertime and the season of fertility and involves dancing around maples decorating everything with ferns and plants and visiting holy springs as for that death ritual title also clarifies that to the best of his knowledge there have never been any sacrifices on midsummer not even in ancient times and what about the weird sex stuff that was completely the twisted brainchild of astor however babymaking is a big part of midsummer which is why a lot of swedes are born a square nine months after the sexy solstice cool and about those psychedelics apparently celebrating swedes are far more likely to get boozy than they are to trip balls duly noted but don't go thinking aster made up everything during a particularly industrious acid trip dude did his homework spending months researching and eventually drawing from swedish traditions and folklore as well as norse mythology indeed harga is a real rural village and much of the film's imagery is consistent with real swedish midsummer celebrations complete with a maypole similarly the somewhat creepy paintings on the barn walls are also true to real agrarian swedish societies people really do eat herring and wear flower wreaths aster also plucked other religious traditions like the blessing of the crops from a famous 19th century anthropological study by james george fraser these lighter details all faithful to swedish culture are complicated by the film's darker turns but we'll get to that later astor even went so far as to learn the scandinavian runic alphabet which was used to write germanic languages in northwestern europe before the adaptation of the latin alphabet he told the ringer that every item of hargra clothing is decorated in specifically chosen runic symbols and in different hieroglyphic language they invented specifically for the film a notable example comes when christian dons a white robe before entering the world's weirdest fertility ceremony the robe is decorated with the upwards arrow tiwas symbol associated with the nordic god tier who represents bravery masculine energy and virility fittingly tears sacrifices his hand to save the world which is appropriate for a dude who's about to be well sacrificed dany in contrast has two runes on her dress that showcase her character's duality an r-shaped rivo which symbolizes journey and an hourglass-shaped thawgaus rune which could mean new beginning or loss of hope both symbols are up for interpretation but each feel relevant to danny's journey as far as the death stuff goes aster was likely inspired by long debated viking mythology and folklore certain written and visual accounts from the prehistoric viking period depict sacrifices of horses dogs birds and yes humans which apparently occurred every 9 years these accounts have been disputed by scholars but they pretty much agree that if human beings were sacrificed it probably happened before 10 50 a.d so regardless some creative liberties are being taken other striking moments are also infused with elements of norse mythology for instance christian is put inside a bear carcass before being burned alive bears are significant in norse mythology viking men donned bare skins before battle and some even believe that the skins protected them from fire perhaps even more grotesque is the fate of simon the british guy who kristen finds splayed open his lungs somehow still breathing this gruesome sight is a reenactment of the blood eagle a viking torture ritual that involves inside outing a dude the blood eagle was first documented in 865 but scholars are unsure whether it's possible and none have exactly volunteered to be the guinea pig then there are the harga love rituals some of which bear resemblance to reality for instance we see the harga young women picking different types of flowers in real life they would pick 7 different kinds of flowers and put them under their pillow to conjure dreams of their future mate instead christian seducer maya places a carved love rune under his bed in a more shocking moment christian discovers a pubic hair in his pie a love spell astor insists comes from actual swedish folklore at a different point christian's drink is slightly redder than the others suggesting that there's menstrual blood in there which aster also says comes from lore we've had trouble confirming either practice and attempting to made the people at the library think that we're weirdos so don't say we don't make sacrifices for you guys anyway the point is that astor had fun combining truth and fiction old and new mythology and history to build his creepy haven of cell phone-free agrarian life for ritualized human sacrifice is as normal as sourdough bread that's certainly not a criticism if every horror film was confined to reality the genre would be pretty boring but in using this potpourri of references is aster trying to make a deeper point let's look at the two very different ways the film's outsider characters react to these rituals we'll start with dany who despite the demented arsenal that's going down ends the film with a smile what are we supposed to make of this has dany become evil or is there something more to it we think so and her character arc proves it danny begins the film pretty firmly ensconced in a cold alienating secular society filled with icy lonely city streets the colors are muted and we get the sense that this is not a happy world after losing her entire family nobody really comforts dany and her boyfriend only stays with her to seem like a good guy her world feels pretty absent of community and emotional support she's shown alone in her house with phone calls providing much of her communication with the outside world her detachment is apparent in her first phone call with christian the camera is set squarely on her face without a single cut to him implying that she's talking to somebody who isn't fully present i'm very lucky to have you several other conversations are shown in mirrors which could imply that people aren't really connecting and are only seeing each other's superficial public face her boyfriend is constantly trying to get away from her i was just gonna go to that party for 45 minutes forgets her birthday and pressures her to take hallucinogens despite her recurring panic attacks early on their swedish friend pella tells her that despite being orphaned as a child i have always felt held by a family a real family which everyone deserves you deserve it's clear what she's lacking love empathy and community and that's exactly what she finds when she encounters the harga people now although she spends the first half of the film extremely wary and frightened of them she's eventually seduced by the warmth of their community plus drugs the harga even seem to move in tandem as if they're all dancing to the same piece of choreography they behave like different parts of the same organism the idea of shared catharsis both in pain and pleasure is present throughout the film when this old man survives his leap off a cliff the rest of the tribe moan in unison as of experiencing a collective pain this is repeated in the final ritual sacrifice and similarly during christian's hot date we see the women moan in unison with maya as if sharing her pleasure every feeling experienced is shared by the community as astor puts it their language is empathy at first dany's intimidated by their sense of unity feeling too scared to join the ritual dancing you guys should join oh no i'm too scared however she does appear to be struck by the connectedness of the people staring closely during ceremonies after the horrific sacrificing dany is visibly stunned and devastated but she listens attentively as the elder woman explains we view life as a circle a recycle as someone who has recently lost her whole family the idea of life being a circle of rebirth has to be attractive we see dany become increasingly more immersed in the harga culture as she starts to find the cult a community she craved most basically this is shown in her costume which transforms from her dark real world clothing to an apron and eventually a full dress and flower wreath before the maypole dance here she takes more hallucinogens but this time in a ritualized motion sharing the experience first with one harga girl and then with the entire circle of them though she's slightly off rhythm she can't avoid being led into the dance and the dizzying experience is the first time we see her truly smile she's finally moving as part of the singular harga organism but the most important moment of the film happens after she sees christian having sex with rando swedish girl she bursts into uncontrollable tears echoing the way she cried after learning about her family's death except this time she's surrounded by a group of hargo women who cry in tandem with her as if sharing her emotional load and completely empathizing with her pain interestingly dany's increased inculcation into the cult is mirrored by her increased immersion into nature this begins psychedelically when she hallucinates her hands growing grass and then her feet turning into grass over the course of her may queen rulership she becomes covered with more and more flowers to the point of absurdity by the end she has almost entirely disappeared into a gown and crown of bright blossoms symbolizing her surrender to nature and this agrarian society we see this new fidelity to the harga society when she picks christian rather than a harga to be the ninth sacrifice as she watches the burning she experiences pain but like the harga also experiences joy she's watching the vestiges of her former life crumble and can't help but smile as she is free to start anew in a community where she can belong and be seen it's creepy as hell but makes for pretty great cinema but if you're not interested in joining a community of happy inbred blonde people there's another option enter christian and the dude bros they approach the harga people with the condescending distance of anthropology students working on a thesis sneaking into temples to take photos of secret religious texts or watching the rituals as if surveilling animals at a zoo the crazier the animals act the better a peer-reviewed paper they'll have meanwhile mark the unabashed fool is more preoccupied with banging swedish chicks and could care less about their beliefs as demonstrated when he pees on a sacred tree and can't comprehend their reactions i just had to pee in general they approach the harga culture with the same detached shock and intrigue as us an audience so alienated from the value of ancient rituals that were willing to buy into the idea that they could be this horrific or at least buy in enough for it to effectively scare us so what is aster doing here the way we see it the film is constantly playing into and subverting our modern secular aversion to mystical traditions religious worship has become increasingly alien to many of us leading theologian david bentley heart to write that our religion is one of very comfortable nihilism we tend to see ritual acts as primitive and potentially barbaric that this film's particular boogeyman takes the form of very religious swedes rather than a sadistic serial killer or a shape-shifting clown speaks volumes about our society's fear and aversion to ritual at the same time astor depicts the harga clan as the precise answer to everything wrong with dany's life she's offered complete acceptance genuine reciprocity and total empathy thus mid-summer is a shocking reassertion of the value of ritual no matter how irrational these acts may seem they have a very rational purpose to build community and a sense of belonging we'd go ahead and say that's wisecrack certified deep but what do you guys think is midsummer a compelling horror show that comments on our increasingly secular society or is it just pagan people equals weird [Music]
