only play with friends getting spat on in first person would be really funny having a baby partner robocop where it's the scene where robocop the original where it's like he's it's after he dies spoiler alert and it's when like he's like seeing that there's a woman that kisses him on the eyeball man really oh yeah that remember there's a little office party yeah there's an office party there's a partner robocop where the up there's an office party and one of the female scientists like kisses him it was for the sake of that you're not supposed to think about it that hard but it's like she kisses the camera but his camera is his eye so she kissed him on his eyeball his open eye do you guys see those those duplicate npcs back there no the game bugged out had two of the same he still had a beta eye and so it was literally just like a big camera lens sticking out of his head she so she knew she just thought of it like a camera and just kissed the lens you just made your own rubble cup wiki backstory yeah that was beta robot i think he had all the same parts throughout that on they were process it i don't want to talk the man bun no more i'm sick of this guy's conversation good thing you could skip ahead got the job you work i'm just gonna do this this is actually that's a good feature is this like the movie click where you're on autopilot i've got the click little remote in my hand right now okay no i don't want to skip ahead no no don't i don't want to skip ahead no more you're the fonz you're my dad you need to saturate yourself in the deep lore of night city you were the part in the clique where uh where where christopher walker goes i'm the angel of death i'm the angel i'm the hater okay what what's happening this feels like it's glitching or something you know this is supposed to be happening but yeah i know what you mean oh it's they're trying it's like a film though but every time it cuts in the textures pop in and out it's also a little bit weird when it's this doesn't work as well when it's pov it works better when you're seeing like two characters on screen look at that what the [ __ ] was that did you see that it means they have to have all these scenes like pre-loaded for this to work and it's not working right yeah okay i don't want to be his friend also what sorry what facilitated this i don't think they well to be fair there was nothing in his hand would i say what did you do i forget i don't know we're just silly cyberpunks i guess what are you watching though is this like the intro for the what is this this is just explaining that now you and this guy are thick and thick as thieves yeah we're probably literally thieves too you know what that's a pretty clever way to cut ahead without having to do all that it would be cool if it's like a movie it's like a movie trick yeah that's ridiculous did we we didn't really get to choose a physique did we i kind of wanted him to be like really skinny there really were only two like base models this game was like bragging about character customization for like five years straight as far as i reckon and it seems like the only the only thing i remember about their brags that they delivered on was the dick yeah the dick the dick physics yeah they got nick fits i'm sick of new stuff anyway it hurts my brain too much you're coming up with new stuff it's pretty hard he wants to train us i don't have time for this yeah skip it maybe later yeah i just want to see drive your car into a person like a gt i did do that last time i played and and it it took like it took like a half hour like if you have a game that's an open world you do not think you could teach them to do these things through missions or something i don't want to be better to just to kind of throw somebody in the world and let them figure it out and figure it out we're gonna be playing for what 60 hours anyway i heard i heard about unfinished games from develop reviewers that were like 160 hours wow this is supposedly a massive massive game let's answer uh t-bug what happens if you never answer is that t-bug that's t-bug i love talking to t-bug if you don't answer the answer anyway so t-bug just hacks in your eye like that yeah yeah i think he has robot eyes welcome i am from the year 2077 welcome i am in here i am in the futuristic elevator in the year 2077 20 20 20. 20 xx 2020 there's gonna be a lady that pops out of the apartment on the left see if you can shoot her no no hurry you can wave her inside can you hit her in the face or she'll just go inside anyway with a gun uh i like it when games put in these options anyway and you can do them uh okay begin hacking yeah it's it's a it's a whole tab and then i guess what is it saying click uh a kid there's too much [ __ ] on the screen right now it's crazy sorry i was reading like 10 things looking for it kick okay so you can always shoot other characters that are like oh man i'm hungry now you're hungry for a ps2 hot dog yeah oh god if i just had a little one of those actually it was the walk with the low mane actually it was that flat jpeg of the noodles like really yeah yeah the flat lo mean and the the flat that pizza is helping too it's kind of a combination of all of those i'm just like having fun looking at all the different future items like the future paper right there the future paper the future the future wall even ew what happened here oh my god inspect cyberware looks too cheap i can see her nipples yeah this game seems like it's got lots of nudity in it that's cool it also has lots of non-interactive [ __ ] yep like shooting a bullet into a body and nothing happens yeah you have to get two headshots to kill him because it's like i said it's like rpg rules oh well maybe they've got robot heads thank god you had that futuristic gun my future gun shoots bullets did he just shoot directly into me and nothing happened that guy's those people are hitting you i mean we are on normal to be fair yep it is a surprisingly small amount of feedback you get when you take damage like you just got shot a bunch of times and i watched your health bar go out but oh my health did go down yeah it didn't you know nothing happens on screen except for that your health goes down it's kind of like i want to see that again yeah that's ted you're getting shot right that actually didn't give you that much health back oh it's slow slow i mean they look good when you shoot them you might want to pop yourself with another little injection do i have one oh yeah you've got like seven come here you i've had enough honestly okay that looks good oh that looks so [ __ ] take that one of your buttons does like a quick melee karate i don't know tomorrow you should play this i'm not having fun at all are you sure yeah this looks like it's okay if you want i didn't like i said when i played last night i didn't find this part particularly funny either well that was noisy i have no idea what the controls are oh wsd makes you wsd uh shifter makes you a shift and uh space makes you space i have no idea how to get into my like inventory is it i i guess that would make sense oh is it i for inventory do you remember back in the day when you'd play a game and uh you'd ask yourself while playing it oh can i do this little thing and then then you can and you're like wow that's awesome it's the coolest experience to be like can i can i interact with this or mess with this and when you can do exactly what you're thinking of and it works you're like thank you thank you for putting in the effort yeah thank you for thinking of this like i did it and putting it in yeah watch out tumer x yeah again x i haven't i've been taking a ton of damage without realizing it too yeah what why the [ __ ] did they do it like this and also it's like light red on kind of darker red oh [ __ ] you so it's not like it's like red on black that you can look up and see easily what is the quick what is the quick attack button i don't know i really want to know i get if they don't want to put call of duty jam on the screen but like have the camera shake or something oh wow dude that took off like all your health and i think he's shooting you through the door which is kind of yeah he is look he's hitting you [ __ ] you [ __ ] you i guess he's got a robot division oh cool now i can take this oh this'll defeat all the bad guys uh fine i'll pick up like i normally playing these games i would just collect everything but i just want to get on with the show hey tomar where's this guy yeah do you like fart music what does that even mean listen is that a genre oh what i'm listening to right now it's sort of like a guy who's about 360 pounds taking it what that's what what happened you just instant transmission is it really just this guy screaming oh my god this game is so buggy i don't know he shut his head off he was lying there the whole time you're shouting oh look at the future toilet be bored we are the ice people welcome to the year 2017 this is so cyberpunk what is more futuristic than a woman in a [ __ ] battle of ice beep i don't tell you what frozen nipples oh it's avatar now i love you nathiri wake up wake up nity oh no it's jake sully wake up jake sully your editor i know it's hard to but please put little george foreman's over her nipples wow they're really just shoving those titties in our faces what if i don't want to look at titties today hand over the woman and no one gets hurt wait these guys are an ambulance why are they so mad at you because they're cyber ambulance that scared the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of me i didn't move last time i played oh someone actually jumped on the couch i guess i shouldn't have made a sudden movement and lurch toward that man pointing a gun at me it's a lesson well-learned come on man he's not reacting to you shooting bullets an inch away from his head nice moves man you just terminated yourself through the uh the elevator it's not opening up quick enough i want everybody at home to understand that i just like all of you have been hype about this game for a very long time for a very long time and but i'm not about to delude myself into thinking that this was a product that was ready to ship definitely seems like they just should have delayed it they did like 58 times again yeah i want to see t-bug this isn't fair that's not tea bug that's what that's wacaco i am working in the year two that's so funny to me in the year 20 20 70 70 70 20. i am what they're called in the year 2077 futuristic elevators we have red eyes can we stomp like dinos the future sounds awesome in the future everyone does the dyno stomp everybody do the dino stuff [Laughter] that is a cyberpunk movie the mario brothers movie oh you're right it kind of is a cyberpunk on the floor i mean it doesn't say dino stomp i don't know why i said that did your dad ever dino stump into your room and hit you with a towel because mine sure didn't where did that come from then usually it was like a sickle or a scythe or something with a sickle or a scythe yeah it's harvest season look at all the crowds why would everybody be outside it's raining i saw that's a fair point i saw literally not a single person with an umbrella see i saw absolute lies saying that this was the most like realized like realistic you really feel like you're in the world thing of like that's ever been out like saying that look at that [ __ ] ps2 on that van the [ __ ] all of the reviews they're like this is the most this is the most immersive experience what is this it feels so weird there's no sounds coming from you ready to fly i definitely shot that driver in the head with a shotgun i had to wait for the scripted event where he just crashes even though he didn't react at all i don't think you even had the [ __ ] it's the future all right it's okay it's the year 2077. holy [ __ ] sorry for breaking the fourth wall there it's all right you just got worked up because you weren't prepared for what happens in 2077 you're not ready for the future yet wait what's he screaming about now was he even he does he looks he doesn't look alarmed at all he's more calm though i think he was supposed to be done screaming at this part your girl your girl you you have a you with a girl a girl i i completely misjudged you you have a good evening now officer he really sounds like bender to me i don't know why i mean no i i totally see the resemblance maybe it really is him but i'm not expanding the character [ __ ] you meatbag make sure i hate you bob dylan up on stage who the [ __ ] are you oh by the way i want to read i want to reiterate something what i want to reliterate something you want to re-literate what did you what i wanted something i don't even know what you were saying whoa you know this is exactly what i wanted to say uh this game is janky and [ __ ] up as hell right i don't i don't encased in its current state yeah i like i'm not saying uh this game sucks because of it what i'm saying is the fact this game got 10's out of 10 across the board it is so [ __ ] clear how corrupt this [ __ ] [ __ ] is these [ __ ] paid for reviews it's tough if any other game if some indie game this game could be broken for all i care it's funny as hell but god damn if they're not lying when they say it's perfect there's no way this is a 10 out of 10 experience so someone is gonna tell us it's because you were running on an obsolete pc eat [ __ ] this pc right you only had a 1080 ti don't care my pc rocks we've we've also seen more than one thing it's it's not been just been like one no we're not the only [ __ ] people it's like this this is in the news this is the news of the week are you still like a little scripted story can you just like run out to the city yet no yeah i'm very much still in a little scripted story i can't wait to replay this yeah definitely everyone's gonna look forward to replaying the game and sitting through two hours of this before they can actually play the game that they wanted to play uh well in skyrim when i start the game and i have to sit through 30 minutes of sitting in a wheelchair and getting pushed in a mountain i think that's fun also in gta 5 when i have to run out into the snow and shoot police for 40 minutes instead of just starting the game of shooting police on my own that's also kind of fun i love replaying that stuff i don't know about you guys hey since this is the future can you like [ __ ] inside the elevator yeah they are toilets they carry the [ __ ] someone was already doing it here yeah there you go watch it jimmy fallon watch watch 26 watch 2077 to be found that's stephen colbert yeah that's steven colbert and jimmy put together just some cool are you still talking about trump yeah well it's still funny i hope in 50 years they're both like robotic like cybermen kept alive by like you know that donald trump is orange in the year 2077. his skeleton's hands are very small well you know you don't know if he'll be dead by that or not donald trump's going to be kept alive this is my stash man he's gonna have like copper wires connected to his face i have i own a knife that's [ __ ] scary he's getting shocked into being alive for the rest of his days wake up wake up wake up all right so this is i think this finally puts us into the open world game i have not played past this point why not i because i got bored and i turned it off oh you controlled yeah why would you lie sideways to the pillow comfortable [ __ ] to the comfortable pillow is it just me or is that really too far left that's way too far away it's like tangenting with the side of the screen or maybe that's just the tv guys we're calling this channel the super nitpick bros from now on so you can't complain if we nitpick you just can't you signed up for this we're called the nitpicking trio for a reason we we nitpick and we pick our asses and we nitpick our pick ass picking oh look at the beanbag no i guess i'm still on a track let's see if i can go out just run out yeah escape escape this cage [Applause] okay for a second i thought it was just gonna let us get away with that
