hey everyone you would test the term thanks so much for joining us on Ludacris feed today we're gonna do an auto pilot test in Sydney on Military Road on Sydney's lower North Shore we're gonna drive from this point which is the warring expressway on Military Road across neutral bay and Cremorne and then head up the spit bridge then back up north through the way coast parkway alright so I'm going to engage autopilot now two shakes down with the right stalk and away we go now I would argue that military Road in Sydney is one of the busiest roads normally but doing covert it's probably a little bit quieter than quieter than usual as you'd expect but nevertheless it can be confusing because the lane markings do change but on our journey we'll see a few things we'll see stop signs we'll see traffic lights we'll see lane markings that stop sign marking the on the road is incorrect because it's actually a bus lane marking so something for future updates hopefully okay so I'm currently in the wrong lane [Music] it's okay it's disengaged itself a definite didn't waivable steering wheel it just start disengaged that's fine let's go back to our cruise control what I'll do is I'll just take up a manually switch out of this Lane so I'm in the middle lane then once across this intersection I will re-engage autopilot once more so at the moment I'm on basic autopilot which is not navigate which is just basic Lane Keeping Assist well lane lane keeping auto steer and and cruise control and traffic aware as well so it follows the cars ahead of me we'll see that yeah I took over again cuz it was definitely confused like I said this road the markings do change occasionally which is why I'm always a bit vigilant with autopilot I might have seen on the footage there that there were lights in the road to indicate a change of lanes depending on time of day so that wasn't a good test for the car didn't pass that one at all which is why I always say keep your hands on the wheel eyes on the road okay so we're just passing through Cremorne it's still pretty busy I must say all right another test area crossing the intersection okay good that followed the lane pretty well there more cones on the side of the road bit of light rain starting to fall in Sydney doesn't rain too much you're in Sydney see how well the automatic wipers work in this light rain as I've said before in previous videos I do like the fact that the car is good for stop-start traffic in autopilot mode it basically goes from zero from us from a standing start to the speed limit which I always find very impressive and there go the wipers that's nice okay so not too bad that was the busiest part of military Road so just the one misshapen as as the lanes changed on the road there that's okay alright so we're sort of heading into a Mossman and I'll take a left before most now and we'll go up at the spit bridge it's quite picturesque down that way yeah one viewer commented that when it works well it feels like the car is on Rails I've got to say it's pretty good when the lane markings are good the car does feel very solid and mind you I'm in basically in the city I'm not on the open road so you know I think it's doing a fairly good job okay so we're coming up to the spit Junction and what I'll do is I'll swing into the left lane here and keep auto lane change quick pretty well [Music] it's a parked car it's okay I've disengaged that so I can get into this Lane okay and just back on autopilot again all right some more dubious lane markings coming up okay followed it pretty well there I guess that one isn't was a bit more obvious you see how on the road there there's two sets of markings once again it's okay the car performed reasonably well again the spit bridge has got two speed cameras this is where I guess cruise control and autopilot is handy it just just gets follows the speed limit very well no chance of a ticket if the speedometer is correct small rubbish bins there on the side it's not traffic cones there's the first speed camera no dramas crossing an intersection come on buddy yeah yeah but disengaged again whether it was me or the car not sure I think it's probably me just gripping the wheel a bit too tightly I think I'd rather do that then if the car trying to follow the lane next to me and then this truck is right behind me so safety first guys ok so here we are on the spit bridge on the descent just coming up to the second speed camera now okay this is where it's dubious again with the lane markings there are traffic cones or markers on the right that's okay we're in the middle lane so it shouldn't be a bother to us all right so as I've explained before in the past if you're the first card at traffic light currently with this software update twenty twenty point twelve point eleven point one you've got to turn autopilot off because the car would just race through it won't react to traffic lights just yet or stop signs but in future updates I think it will because in the States it's starting to react to traffic lights so for now you know you know you still if you're not used to autopilot if you're the first car at the lights turn it off if you're the second and subsequent car that's fine just leave it on and should stop with the car ahead of it okay it's back on autopilot traveling at 50 hands on the wheel it's a big truck next to me so I want to play too many games you happy to take it off at any time some traffic markers am i right there okay that passed that test here we are on the spit bridge okay more traffic markings don't hit it okay well that did a good job all right well on the other side now on the ascent so that was good reasonably well I wouldn't say I did great along the Military Road but on this big bridge did okay I thought all right so what we're gonna do is find our way onto the way coast Parkway and head north again it been a road here because roads aren't as tight bit more space lane markings don't change from memory so you should do a better job right here all right so what we want to do is got Sydney roads we're gonna do a left lane change very nice doing a left year so what I'm gonna do change one more time no didn't make it okay so that was a manual break didn't react fast enough that's okay okay gauge and then lane change just for the sake of it there is a roundabout coming up and I'm not game enough to try it again very low tolerance to turning it off Elon Musk did tweet that roundabouts are quote unquote easy so we'll shall see in subsequent updates whether that is the case at the moment it's just not a happy customer when it comes to roundabouts but it's I'm probably gonna take it off pretty quickly here yeah so we're doing right here see I mean the autopilot sign has come off anyway four roundabouts okay okay so let's engage autopilot again should be 50 kilometers an hour not school zones just yet it's only 150 3 p.m. it's also in start at 2:30 all traffic lights more bins there's a stop sign there should be able to see it it surrounds the corner oh yeah nice good job good job oh that's tight that's tight oh not too tight around that corner come on car take the middle of the lane here not good that's right I took over all right so should be 60 in a minute there we go punch 60 no no I went 70 I got down 60 all right bit more relaxed to you roads a bit better basically one straight road then we'll round the corner onto the wackest Parkway that should be quite a nice Drive on straight road on 80 kilometres an hour still think it's too much to the right hand side for my liking considering it's oncoming traffic on the other side I would like to see it hugged the middle and possibly the left side a bit more look great on corners that's one one criticism not smooth just yet okay so now we're onto the West Parkway it's a nice straight road quite picturesque after this traffic light I don't there's a full bulb light in a row and it's not gonna pick it up yeah it's just a three bulb at the moment and the screen Oh phantom breaking they're not shown up in weird very weird must have hit a dip saw a shadow maybe all right it should be 80 in any minutes I think once we passed these lights it should be 80 let's see it's diamond on the road they're not quite right see some fencing on the left nicely there's a speed sign those speed signs for a while pretty sure it's 80 by now just gonna pump it up to 80 it looks not reacting to my scrolling wheel I want iced tea restricted 60 that's why oh that's a shame that's a shame alright I'm gonna go before quickly because I don't know why the car behind me otherwise because it is a t clone is a now there we go it's finally 80s strange strange I couldn't scroll up anyway now it's a okay so this is where the autopilot is in its element nice straight road this is where it's on Rails basically alright guys well that is my little drive today between I guess Crowsnest up to French's forest by Military Road the spit a wake-up spark way using autopilot before I would say maybe 80 to 90 percent of the time I would say there was maybe four or five mishaps so what should I give it today I would give it a b-plus today yeah b-plus that's my report card for autopilot basic autopilot for Tesla Model 3 performance on software update twenty twenty point four point eleven point one with FST visualizations alright guys thanks for watching take care of yourselves I'll see you next time and as always happy charge
