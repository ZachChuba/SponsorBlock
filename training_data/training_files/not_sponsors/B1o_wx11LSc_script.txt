[Today's first turn, Kang Sso~] RINA: Ta-da! Here is... M/V filming site~ I'm in the car while waiting [Getting close with relay cam...] Oh? We have 9 minutes
[#Curious about] not 8 minutes
[#Curious about]
[#KiKiCAM] Because I am in charge of first turn, I turned on the camera! Next to me is DoYeon But I can't show you~ Cuz she will be coming out later
[It's RINA TIME~] Ok then... How long should I do... to make other members use the remaining time properly? Umm... It seems I can only say few words It is- 3:43 PM now but there're so many things to film Immediately after my turn, it was meal time Everybody is having a meal now Then I will go eat too Really crucial thing of the relay cam, KiKiCAM! No I mean, KiKi song! I have to sing that but... how can I set this camera...? DoYeon: You're relaxed since you're first turn~ RINA: Right! Like this, slowly... Oh 1 minute has passed already! How can I do? (Sudden change)
Whatever~ Other members will... do their best! Ok then I will... finish with KiKi song! I used more than 1 minute alone!
[Happy] [Suddenly started chocolate Mukbang] LUA: I have one more~ Umm! I look prettier here Huh! Princess is here! You know, I love chocolate so much It's more delicious with milk Shadow... A shadow is NG How much time have I used? I think I've used a lot... Well.. Well.. whatever~ Cuz I'm second turn~ This was LUA's 'Eating chocolate snacks deliciously' ♥ Ah, wait a minute [Endless ASMR] I think I'm not good at it... ASMR is not my... specialty [What should I do.. [What should I do.. now..] End! SEI: Ta-da! I'm third turn~ Third relay cam~ In a while, I'm starting at the beginning We're now at 'OOPSY' M/V filming site! How's it? I raised the tip of my eyes in a chic way How's it? We just filmed the group dance And I have to film more individual cuts so I'm going to get some rest at the car There is SuYeon Umm... more than expected, everyone came out very well And... I think the camera filter is really pretty I was satisfied So- I will go and get some rest! I don't know who's the next but... Ah I'm doing it so long
[Proud] I will do it longer~! No, no I have to finish now
[Conflict of two egos] Ok for other members... I'll finish with KiKi song Please look forward to 'Weki Meki - OOPSY'!

DoYeon: Hi I'm gonna film through the mirror, unlike others I'm fifth turn and now... How much time do I have? I don't know but maybe... 2...1 minute? 3 minutes? I think so...
