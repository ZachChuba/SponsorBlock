these are the heart of your system hi and welcome to a follow-up video about X 570 vrm testing in the previous vrm video I asked you to comment down in the video what kind of boards you would like to see in an update video obviously I reached out to my main board manufacturers contacts and asked for some boards for example I was like gigabyte and all of them we will get some new boards soon so there will be a big update test for X 570 vrm thing but for today we are going to take a closer look at the X 570 aqua this is kind of different from all the other boards because it uses a monoblock that covers CPU voltage regulators and also chipset all at once with water cooling therefore it's kind of difficult to compare it with all the other boards because they were all using passive heat sinks on the V RMS but still we will use the same kind of testing mythology so 125 watt 165 what 225 wall and see how this board performs I think it's not going to be much better than the ours extreme or the crosshair but yeah let's see if maybe it's a surprise we'll see price-wise this board is I think about 900 euro right now which is extremely expensive for an x5 70 board considering how much the CPUs cost I mean this board is more expensive than the CPU you would use on there hard to justify but let's see how the temperatures are and maybe the temperatures are the benefit of the price and obviously in the lux Laxus are really nice of this board opening the package you can straight see this letter from a stroke even with my name on there obviously because it's a sample from a stroke same as multiple other youtubers received this thing also my name down here yeah visually it's probably the most beautiful board 4 X 5 70 I totally have to admit that [Music] we will start to remove the waterblock first this part I think there's an M to endow to start underneath and also here is an endo to that underneath this part I think is also cooling the network chip which should sit here [Music] [Music] yes I said this part is cooling a member to drive as well as the network chip that is sitting underneath here not sure how nicely this thing will cool if there's an ember to with full load in addition to the network chip usually I don't even read manuals of main boards but in this case I thought I would take a look at how this is described and it looks actually quite nice also considering how many screws we have on here I was not sure how many of those we actually have to remove to unmount the waterblock and the screws that we need to unmount are also indicated right here it's kind of interesting that on the chipset right here it looks like one screw is missing but there's no thread underneath that's that's fine and we also have to only remove those two while this one stays this one for example also stays this one this one those obviously and that one so we only have to remove the other screws [Music] now that the waterblock is removed we can quickly take a look at the board itself we have m dot 2 here and 2 here X 70 right here type C we have a display port here which is actually funny and we have a network controller on this location right here we have the 14 phase V RM supply of this board here we have the v RM controller well very well known ir35 201 and yeah you're probably familiar with this controller obviously it cannot handle 14 individual phases but if we flip the board around right here those small dots those are the toddlers and that's why we have 14 phases doubled [Music] [Music] I really like the quality feel of the sport it feels like it's a full metal part like full CNC milled now some decent amount of aluminium same goes for the bottom part with the engravement right here and I think RGB lighting on the bottom feels quite nice let's take a look on the water flow in this one obviously this part makes contact with the CPU there is this label on here and I really hate those labels I never understand why they place them on there it's not like you have to protect this especially it's only although it comes already mounted on the boards why would you have to protect this it only leads to that some people forget to peel it off even it's written on there I know this part right here makes contact with the MOSFETs with the power stages I had to remove the thermal pad that was sitting right on top here because we have some screws underneath same goes for this area it's also for power stages inductors on those two areas and obviously on the bottom we have the chipset the water flow starts at the intake right here where the water is split up into basically three channels the main channel goes to the CPU underneath this plastic cover we have the fins where the water flows through to the outtake we also have two very thin channels right here I think they're also too thin I'm not sure I mean obviously they had to make them so thin to make sure that a sufficient amount of water is going through the CPU and not through the vrm channel or through the chipset channel but I'm concerned if there's let's say you're using pastel liquids and you have maybe some particles in there I would be worried that those small paths would be blocked after a while not so sure because they look like one and a half millimeter thick maybe so it's really really thin anyway integrate here goes through the CPU underneath this plastic part we have the fins goes through this channel for the vrm goes through this channel through the chipset cooling right here and then all Tekken [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] I'm done with the testing but before we get to VR and temperature we will take a quick look at my system right here or the system that's assembled there because some of you will also ask what about chips a temperature and also end up to temperature because I highlighted before when I did the disassembly that there is this cooling block in the middle that's cooling the MDOT - and at the same time also the network chip that's why I was a little bit concerned if the heat dissipated from the network chip gets in kind of conflict with the end or - but that's not the case I can directly say that I was running 30 times crystal disc mic while prime95 was running in the background but prime95 with lower load so 13 44 K which is resulting in about 100 watt load on the CPU which you can see right here chips at temperature never exceeded 50 degrees Celsius perfectly fine chips at temperature and same goes for the end go to the coarser MP 600 maximum 49 degree Celsius so component wise chips air temperature and also Drive temperature perfectly fine similar to my previous vrm testing video I did three different test scenarios 125 165 and 225 what load you can go and check out the previous video if you want to know what kind of regions those where or what kind of test conditions I was simulating with those settings let's start with 125 watt load on the CPU with open test bench so that's what you see right here no air flow across the board which doesn't make a difference anyway in this case we can see the excess 70 aqua is by far the best with 39 degree Celsius maximum temperature while aras extreme had maximum of 49 degrees Celsius and crosshair eight hero for example had 51 degree Celsius now we are going to simulate to put this into an 11 dynamic because in my previous video I was also mounting all motherboards inside an O 11 dynamic mounted the a IO and top so we had some air flow across the V RMS it's more real-world testing real-world scenario and yeah we were just taking the same test results from the open test bench and putting it in the same chart because for a water-cooled board it doesn't make a difference if you mount it in the case or not the temperature is just dependent on the radiator that's it and your fan speed looking at the results aqua is still on top but the difference is extremely small 39 degrees Celsius max while our s extreme was 42 and krauser a hero was 44 going to 165 what load again open test bench aqua maximum 45 degrees Celsius our extreme maximum 58 crosshair 8 hero maximum 60 degree cells same test conditions but all other boards were mounted in the old 11 dynamic so they have air flow across the VRMs the xref 70 aqua from a stroke has peaked at 45 degree Celsius still while arrows extreme and crosshair 8 hero are basically the same 46 and 47 degrees Celsius one degree Celsius is basically measurement tolerance or room temperature tolerance so we could say that in this condition it's identical going to 225 watt load open test bench again as expected aqua is the best 53 degrees Celsius max hours extreme 64 courser 8 hero 68 putting it into the case the Aqua and Aras extreme are exactly the same and crosser 8 hero is only a few degree worse now what's the conclusion of all the data if we just take a look at what's happening if we take a very well-designed board and put it into also very well ventilated case the argument of having water-cooled V RMS on this board doesn't really count anymore in my opinion because the temperature is basically identical I mean to even two or three degrees more or less on the vrm doesn't matter at all so yeah getting this board because the V RMS are water cooled would not be the argument for me personally but you can always have perfect temperatures on your components you will always have great temperature on your CPU vrm and ships that are say at the same time while you will never have a chipset fan that can fail but you also have that on the Auris extreme so you have to evaluate yourself if this port is worth 900 euro for you personally I would say it's a little bit too expensive but that's up to you to decide the board is still absolutely beautiful it's packed with a ton of features like two times Thunderbolt 3 but you have to decide yourself if it could be an option for you for purchase let me know in the comments what you think about the X 570 aqua and about the testing results thanks for joining in and see you next time [Music] you
