oh that's some good this is no capitalized on more than just quests welcome welcome welcome continuing on from where we left off it's time to do the waterfall quest remember to have six earth water and air runes as well as your two ropes clear as pebbles some food and boots of lightness when you get outside the Crypt make sure you drop your boots of lightness and the runes and the ropes because otherwise it will not allow you to enter the Crypt then go down into the dungeon when you're running east you want to make sure that you attack a zombie your skeleton so that the moss rinds can't attack you because they will hit up to 14 with both melee and magic you'll see that I do the drop trick method to get a few extra amulets and this is because in the past you needed the amulet itself to enter the waterfall dungeon but it seems that there was an update at some point that made it so you no longer need the amulet so just get one and then after the quest you don't have to worry about it anymore then go south to continue the quest by grabbing the urn try to get a skeleton to attack you here and then on the way back as well which you can see I get hit 14 by the moss giants melee so that's really why you want to make sure the skeleton can attack you since they do have a lot less damage after getting the amulet in the urn go back north to the waterfall to continue the quest once inside go east to grab the key from the crate then go west to unlock the door and head into the tomb use your air earth and water runes on each of the posts then put the amulet on clariel statue and don't take the treasure from the chalice but use the urn on the chalice to complete the quest giving us one quest point 13750 strength and attack experience which bumps us up to 40 for attacking and 30 strengths as well as two diamonds and two gold bars which will likely become rings of life in the far future and then 40 men throw seeds I know that you used to be able to use mithril seeds to bypass the puzzle trap in underground pass however I believe they patched it out but I'll have to check that after finishing at waterfall quest we're going to home teleport to lumbridge head up to the bank and prepare for another few quests going to pull out our best armor and don''t so we can fight the demon for demon slayer and then pull out some wines and cakes for food as well as all our minded errands because I'm gonna go get another set of 30 starter runes in a moment as well as our cash a hatchet to use the canoes and the scrying orb you'll notice that I also pull out the hammer and stake for Vampire Slayer however I decide to take a detour later so we'll actually bank one more time before doing vampire Slayer's so it's not necessary at the moment now let's go grab those 30 starter runes and then head to the canoe take it north and prepare for the most dangerous boss fight we've had yet oh you thought I meant this big red pushover no it's this right here this guy looks ruin my day every time I go to attack the demon he'd just sit there in camp and snipe me with his little earth strike made it a pain in the ass but we got it done and in doing so paved the way to - shadow of the storm once we finished the golem and it gave us five more kudos for the Farrukh ez diary after that we're gonna head north into town and then to the east to buy some more rooms as we're running pretty low right now you'll notice that I bought the priests gown set for the biohazard quest however that's optional at this point as we will be coming back to varrock at least once more prior to need robes for the quest afterward head southeast to the major sanrak and turned in the abyss mini quest for a thousand ran crafting experience which gets us to level 9 not only does that bump us past the very early levels for room crafting which are very slow it also means that because we have level 5 we can craft water runes which is required for the Lumbee easy diary now since we don't have a talisman will probably have to farm the water elemental wizards to the west of Port Sarim as they have a 1 and 20 drop but it also means that because we have level 9 we can craft earth runes which is important for the vorak ez diary and we did get an earth talisman from farming the men in edgeville for the bones for demon slayer so we can do that whenever we rolled in the lumberyard diary tasks as well alright so next up on the list is heading to Draenor to finish Vampire Slayer which will unlock the nightmare zone minigame teleport however the intention afterward is to get dies in Draenor so I need to make sure that I have enough red berries to do so otherwise I'll have to pick more south of arak before heading there so I detour a bit to the bank pull out these supplies to make the red berry pie for the night sword head to the range southwest of the bank and it actually takes me four or five pies which leaves me with exactly enough red berries to make the dies I need so it is smart that I ended up doing this now before leaving varrock make sure you have your steak hammer and garlic and then head southwest past the champions guild over the stepping stones and then into the manor to kill count Draenor finishing the quest gives us three more quest points and 4800 attack experience which unfortunately is not enough to get another level at this point however like I mentioned it does unlock the nightmare zone minigame teleport after heading upstairs go east to leave the manor and on the way pick up a bronze medal for Black Knights fortress then head south into Draenor once at the bank pulled out your coins 69 red berries depending on how many you have left eight onions and six wood leaves then go north to Aggie and get two to three red dies depending on your red berries as well as four yellow dyes and three blue dyes four of Quest's you'll notice that we have exactly 500 coins left which is what we got from the Clocktower quest so I think it's really good that we wrote that in otherwise who'd be dirt poor right now before leaving Draenor I'm going to pull out the four beads for EM catcher and go turn that in it does give 875 magic experience which is nice but it also gives the amulet of accuracy which is the best offensive amulet we're gonna have for some time it only gives +4 to all the textiles but until we get a amulet magic strength or power which will be for some time it's the best we got after that we're gonna head back to train or bank and prepare for the next section in my case I'm gonna pull out my beginner clue scroll that we got from X marks a spot because it tells me to go back to Brian and Port Sarim you'll also want your boots of lightness bronze metal iron chain body and cabbage to do Black Knights fortress as well as your blue dye and orange dye for goblin diplomacy and the brooch to continue Lost Tribe all right so we're popping on over to port Sam to turn and we begin a clue scroll which gives us a casket and opening it we get a hunk of trash but that's okay since I wasn't really expecting much from the beginning clue scroll anyway afterward we're gonna head north to follow door to start the Black Knights fortress quest which I should have started when I came here for the Knights sword just for whatever reason I had no mention of it at all in the route that I've been working on but I was planning to do recruitment drive so got a fitted it then go north do black knights fortress to completion head south to the Dwarven mine talked to null Odeon to get these supplies to take back to Captain log off for Dwarf Canon then head all the way over to goblin village and while they're complete both goblin diplomacy you can find the Goblin male you need in three crates around the camp and then immediately after continue the Lost Tribe quest finishing goblin diplomacy will get us five quest points 200 crafting experience which does bump us up to level seven as well as a gold bar which will be helpful for making most likely a game's necklace or amulet of magic later on head back to follow Doran Bank before we do recruitment drive we're going got south to Rivington a bit in order to do witch's potion and continue the night sword and pick some snake grass for the hangover cure for plague city quest so pull out here I have new burnt meat onion coins and red berry pie a little food just to be safe since we'll be running past them hobgoblins then head south to the peninsula near the crafting guild while there we're gonna pick up 10 or so snake grass we only need one for the hangover cure right now but in the future when we get some radars a little 38 herblore and we can make a few prayer potions it'll be helpful to just have that secondary ingredient already after you get those continue on to rooming ttan and while there start the witch's potion go west to the house and kill a rat you have to start the quest first otherwise it won't drop the rats tail go back and turn the quest for the small amount of magic experience and then go to the crafting store to purchase a ring necklace and amulet mold we don't really need a bracelet mold right now and if desire you could buy a sickle mold however we will be an all card at some point prior to needing the sickle mold for nature spirit then we're going to head east 2/3 go to continue the night sword followed by going back to follow door to bank at the east bank and here I combined the milk chocolate dust and Snape grass to create the hangover cure so that we can save inventory spaces later then I'm going to pull out the copper and tin ore which we will smelt at the furnace on the way to the castle into a bronze bar we need that bronze bar for the observatory quest and this is the best furnace on the way and then afterward we are going to go to the castle talk to the squire then go upstairs and steal the portrait to continue knight's sword now we're going to bank out the east bank once more before heading back to third goes peninsula so pull out your armor boots of lightness no ma'am you lit some food as well as your two iron bars and a pickaxe to mine the blurry [Music] nice then head south to the ice tension mine too blur I Taurus one for the Knights sword one to Smith blow right limbs at dorks anvil for the fall adore easy diary task then go give the bars in or 2/3 go get the knight's sword then go turn it back in and finish the quest finishing the quest gives us a stellar nearly 13,000 smithing experience bumping us all the way up to 29 which means we now are able to do elemental workshop one in finishing that will bump us past 30 so we can immediately do the second one once we start the quest whilst doing the dig site then head west and up the stairs to turn in Black Knights fortress at ceramic cars and immediately start recruitment drive I did forget that Black Knights fortress rewards 2500 GP so we will have to bank again since you can't take anything with you during recruitment drive but that takes a couple seconds and then we can do that quest from start to finish after banking go to the followed or park and do recruitment drive from start to finish finishing the quest gives us a thousand prayer experience bumping us up to 14,000 herblore pumping us up to ten almost eleven and a thousand agility which doesn't quite get us a level and eventually once we get 20 defense we can wear the initiate salad which is the same bonuses as a mithril foe helm but with the prayer bonus of a help of mates it's not which i think is +3 also the level 10 air blower is important because now it means we can start the edict SciQuest you'll also want to make sure that you talk to the certification again and switch your response because it will automatically switch you to follow door being a hardcore Ironman we're not really focused on dying but if it happens Lumbridge is still better than follower since we're going back to Lumbridge to continue and finish the Lost Tribe quest I decide to pull my mines and errands out of the bank before home teleporting and then running north to get another set of starter runes which I kow kow to be 228 GP % which at this point in the run is still pretty significant as actually given how many times we can loop it in head up to the bank and pull out your little as well as a tinderbox in food for safety then head through the mine do your Goblin emotes then head back to continue the quest after finding the ham robes in Sigma's chest you'll actually want to put them on as when your thieving from ham members the more ham gear you're wearing the least likely you are to get thrown out which which is not only annoying but also a waste of time in preparing to go to the ham hideout you'll want to pull out your boots of lightness and ham robes as well as some cakes I grabbed twelve which was actually way more than enough you really only need six to eight because of how fast your inventory fills up head west out of the castle toward the ham hideout pick the lock and go down and then search the crate before the first door that you see for the silverware to continue the lost tribe and then we're gonna spend about 12 to 15 minutes thieving ham members until we can get some coins a steel pickaxe hopefully perhaps an easy clue scroll some buttons to polish for animal magnetism and hopefully some coal so that we can save 67 GP each when we need to buy them for elemental workshop as we don't yet have the mining level to mine coal and then we'll also hopefully get some other hand robes for death to the door Keshan because you need two full sets there's also the chance of getting some opals and Jade's the Jade's in particular are useful for making necklaces of passage which will speed up doing some desert quests like the golem spirits of the led and shadow of the storm and one of the main things we need here to finish off the art EEZ diary are the rusty swords which you can take to the Tindall merchant by the fishing trawler trade in that with 100 coins and then you'll get a sword of some sort out of it there is a chance to fail so it's best to get two or three otherwise we'll have to come back and do the same thing over again we finished about 12 minutes later with a thieving level couple pieces of coal couple spare steel axes couple steel pickaxes some daggers to sell later as well as a couple of rusty swords in an easy clue scroll and almost a full set of ham robes continue The Lost Tribe all the way to completion which gives us 3,000 mining experience bumping us past the requirement for elemental workshop as well as a ring of life which will be handy to save our skin in case we almost those are hardcore status then we're gonna head up in bank pull out our coins boots of lightness stuff for dwarf cannon and a spade as well as some cakes for safety then minigame teleport to barbarian assault run all the way south to turn in the dwarf cannon quest which gives us 750 crafting experience as well as the ability to eventually use a dwarf cannon however that does cost 750 K which is quite a bit we're then going to head northeast and prior to jumping the log shortcut we're actually going to talk to stinkers to get several free poisoned chalices now you can drink these and they have a myriad of effects and assuming each effect has an equal chance of occurring it has a two and seven chance of boosting crafting by one which will be helpful for getting 41 to 42 crafting to make a fishbowl helmet for the pirate Pete sub quest of RFD after getting half into inventory or so we're going to go to the log balance southeast and cross it satisfying in easy kinderen diary requirement then heading up and around to enter McGregor's would then go to the west to check the vines and then use our Spade on it to get at least three vine worms we do need them for fishing contests but they are also a potential item requirement for the fairytale quest remember that if you didn't get two well berries at the gnome grocery store they do spawn here so we're almost at the point in doing elemental workshop but we need coal for the quest and since we don't have level 30 mining we're going to go up to kill the Grimm to unlock the blast furnace to be able to buy the coal for 67 GP each so head all the way up there talk to the Dwarven boat man after you get into the cave watch an incredibly long cutscene start the giant dwarf quest to unlock blast furnace and if your minigame teleport is up you can now minigame teleport to blast furnace if it's still on cooldown just walk east by the coal that you need remember that I got two from chem members then Bank everything except for your coins boots of lightness and a pot then head back out of Celtic rim and go to the Sinclair mansion to do murder mr. quest when heading to Sears village pub during the quest make sure you buy a stew from the bartender as it satisfies an easy can dart and diary tasks finishing the quest gives us another three quest points 2000 coins and 1406 crafting experience which bumps us up to level 16 to get it up higher we will be doing a little bit of flack spinning into bow strings and then Observatory quest the big reason we're doing some crafting grinding on top of questing is so that we can reach level 30 technically 31 because shadow of the storm requires 30 lost city requires 31 and we need a skill to be at least level 30 before we can use diary lamps on it at once we get our arty cloak one will have a diary lamp to use and herb-lore won't be 30 for a while so I think it's best he used on crafting right now we're gonna finish up this episode by going to Camelot castle to start Merlin's crystal and then next time we're gonna be getting several diary tasks done some fishing levels from fishing contests or crafting and spitting from Elemental workshop some mining from plague City and then we'll also be doing biohazard so that we can finish the RT easy diary and finally get the cape and land see you next time
