over the years I've done break downs of the Soul series bosses based on difficulty quality taking into account lore design and entertainment value and most recently I broke down the best and worst of their arenas the final piece of their puzzle is a ranking that has been requested time and time again over the years and djd mod is finally ready to deliver on your request that is every video I make is gonna show my bias but I don't think there's an aspect of the boss package that is more subjective than their theme tasty music is going to vary dramatically from person to person so instead of giving my own highly biased list I pulled you all and after tallying up nearly 1500 votes I've got a list of the top 10 boss tunes to share with you today and even a few interesting data bits on how tracks rate from game to game but for a moment allow you out there and thank you for listening and now without further ado here are the community's choices for the top 10 best boss themes in the soul series number 10 sister Frida and father area del when I'm drafting a portion of a video covering a particular boss I always listen to their theme to throw my mentality into the heat of that battle soundtracks have the power to tie in your emotions as it relates to what you're currently experiencing and when you replay the track later it can bring those sensations back it's a neat phenomenon when I was listening to freeze track for the last few videos she appeared in it's grown on me as one of my personal favorites sister Frida and father Aryans l have the most chilling intense music in the whole series the melancholy and creepy chords playing the first time free to win a visible is probably one of the most nerve-racking experiences I've had playing Souls born on top of that the gang fight and Black Flame have much more intense music that still carries the motifs and themes from the first phase I'll never get over how restless and uneasy this theme makes me feel this the character fits the lore absolutely flawless hats off to you Samuel on taking an analytical approach to have the theme and fight tie together throughout its different phases your passion really shines and the same can be said for all of you the commented reading through your comments gave me an even greater appreciation for how much these tracks mean to us both in game and at their best on a rotating playlist for Frida I agree that the subtle tones and operatic melody lulls me into a false sense of security as she stalks her prey carefully as if I gets more intense from the duo to the Black Flame conclusion the full chorus bursts in to match the new energy this slow build makes my anxiety climb to the moment it explodes into all-out adrenaline in the demanding final moments its handling one of my personal favorites and I'm happy to see it made the same impact on all of you number nine Knight Artorias in contrast to Frida I have to admit that I'm scratching my head on this one obviously I love artorias fantastic lore perfectly balanced challenge excellent move pool creative buff mechanics and high-caliber entertainment value are all present here but this is the only boss on today's list I had to actually go back and listen to the soundtrack to remember what it even sounded like as soon as I did it all rushed back to me instantly it wasn't quite the same without the desperate cries of Rage but I can't believe I slept on this track for so long I still don't think it would quite crack my own top 10 but it's certainly welcomed in the conversation when you first see the intro you'd expect a really badass orchestral but when it begins it's a somber theme capturing the whole that Artorius is falling into and soon the music ramps up the stakes as the fight is realized Artorius a once great hero was reduced to a hollow shell of what he once was the theme is badass but it's just really sad I want to thank you and other commenters for giving me a greater appreciation for the song your words are sound reminders of how much the artorias fight means to me and breaking down the choice of sorrowful melodies over bombastic operatic sizz something that I'd never thought of as you well stated the tragedy of artorias is dug justice through its theme and for that I fully respect the community's choice to place it in the top number eight lady Maria of the astral Clocktower lady Maria easy number one best OST in the game hands down a [ __ ] I listen to this in my car sometimes just because [ __ ] slaps that and Kira's theme from Jojo but that's irrelevant I should probably go into wild little basically the way the music builds and how it goes from beautiful gothic chance yet gets progressively more feverish and manic fits astoundingly with the frantic nature that Maria fights with as the battle progresses and she starts to unravel like I said best OST [ __ ] easy water roller coaster best of Aseema [ __ ] I be riding around the neighborhood blasting these jams letting the world know the top Souls waifu and best boss contender isn't just brimming with fascinating lore blowing my mind with her smooth mechanics and thunderous challenge now my girl has a bomb-ass theme [ __ ] slaps my boy I even had time to throw in an always relevant Jojo reference easy well nothing else to say on that spot Yanni your taste in boss OS T's is truly adding a culture Brandon also did a superb write-up focusing deeply on how the simple melodies in the beginning matcher grace while still exude intensity but down to the frantic harmonies in the third phase that perfectly illustrate her desperation to the b2 and Hydra darkest demons it really can't be understated how much these songs enhance their accompanying battles sure if you muted the game every bit of the boss design would remain but when every shred of battle is enhanced from note to note of its OST that's when you know you've got an incredible boss track on your hands number seven Dragonslayer Ornstein an executioner's smoke I wish there was a way to put an addendum in the survey for the come on and slam version of O and Isis theme because it is fire of course it wouldn't be what it is without the original masterpiece their theme is royal and fitting for the strongest remaining Knights of Gwyn the theme immediately creates a sense of power around the duo there's also the fact that you won't get tired of it which is good because the amount of dust it will their LST really does use grandiose power that matches the scope of the challenge ahead and I love the thought of it playing well and repeat because you're right this duo is playing the lives of many undead and yet it is right amongst the best in a very stiff competition if anything it has to be one of the most memorable on the basis that's been burned into most of our brains for how long we spend here that fact coinciding with the being held in such high esteem is plenty to indicate why it's deserving of its place as a top theme in the series number six abyss Watchers I'm thrilled to see the abyss Watchers didn't fly under the radar I think most would agree the watchers are by far the most memorable early experience in Dark Souls 3 and part of what stuck with me since day one was their wonderful theme it perfectly embodies their graceful combat and fearful presence but also mixes in the tragedy of their past with both artorias and them being overcome by the abyss mixing that in with the visuals is exactly why the abyss watchers are one of the greatest non DLC bosses hard to disagree with you on all accounts in contrast artorias there is a powerful choir involved in a significant portion of the track but that doesn't mean excused toward an emphasis of over-the-top energy it still holds a tonne of sorrow underneath its growing intensity that builds as you slug it out it matches their ferocity but conveys the agony that lies beneath their failure to overcome the abyss I couldn't think of a better fit for their battle or many candidates more do a spot on today's list bro if ludwig ain't top 5 well do I have a treat for you because everybody's favorite flush horse weak to his way into the top 5 just barely by 2 votes over the abyss Watchers it's difficult because no one on today's list is undeserving of the honor but hot damn am i biased on this one Ludwig's theme is the tale of two masterpieces in that transition when he regains lucidity has operatic spouts to end no not November through sound alone it's a marvelous piece in terms of composition and is tailored to complement the fight itself perfectly words just can't do it justice and it remains the only track to make me physically react while listening to it same if you mean gasping with glee like a schoolgirl every time he says those famous words Ludwig is the peak of blood boards hand down rain as the best soundtrack of the six games the first phase feels like he's slowly crawling on your back ready to slaughter you although let's be real most of this phases music is overshadowed by the bosses beautiful but the real start of the show is when the cutscene kicks in when that eerie theme starts playing you knew something's gonna happen and it's gonna be something big and then with Ludwig regains his humanity and starts fighting you like the proud hunter he once was the music starts building and building and building some more until boom you get that huge satisfying why are the releases all the tension you built and makes an already great fight into a perfect one number four gehrman the first Sunter emotional impact and conflict cannot be understated here gentlemen's fight has an astronomical narrative depth that is matched perfectly by its accompanying theme the goosebump inducing cutscene before the fight prepares you for an adrenaline-filled epic battle the likes have never been seen yet when the fight starts the low somber strings bring you back down to earth a realization that perhaps gehrman isn't the bad guy in the traditional sense and is even attempting to help you just as he had the whole time as the fight goes on the music grows just as the ferocity of the battle does for shen going into an epic chorus of voices booming as gehrman pulls out all the stops in an effort to free and all of this is in the context of the fight itself as a standalone piece it's just as relevant and fantastic a real argument as to why video games should be considered a form of art amen to that ethan i really can't say it better the theme perfectly fits the conflict of taking on your mentor and the relationship underneath with maria his contract with the moon presence and your intentions for slaying government to either succeed in his folly or ascend to a higher plane makes a battle riddle deeply with conflict match magically by this haunting tune number three slave night gale for me slave night Gale seemed is the best one it just made me feel all the moments I had with the series describing it perfectly with a slow start at the beginning of the fight just like I had my first time playing Dark Souls then turning into an epic fast-paced rush just like you experienced when you really get into the game then a full trip of emotions came through my heart by listening to him say [Music] I always get chills when the music changes is the real fight begins on sheer depth alone gale might have the most impressive composition of any boss team in the franchise it's quite long alters with nothing short of perfection throughout every beat of the fight and it pulls the exact emotions out of the player to maximize entertainment excitement and the adrenaline rush I've spent plenty of time gushing about what I love about Gale from his arena lure design mechanics difficulty and impact over the first time I'm proud to be able to give him proper dude for boasting one of the finest themes and all of souls number two soul of cinder I'd have to say my favorite theme is soul of cinder that theme is so good from the choir in the first phase to the slow transition to Quinn's piano I love how this theme has the fanservice but also has a sort of uniqueness to it just like the fight does this theme is also great because of its finality which goes along with the theme of the game throughout my best boss arena video I harped on how much the end of a journey can leave an impression on you soul of sender manages to do that in twofold it's the end of the trilogy and it pays homage to the series roots with a musical cue that gave us all a flare of nostalgia the dark souls games left a lasting impact on so many of us and this theme not only heralded in one of the better series bosses but also its conclusion that gravity carried a lot of weight one which the accompanying theme has the power to carry the transition to piano in the second phase had me shaking my first time throughout a bittersweet taste of the final moments of a series that impacted me so heavily the theme execute flawlessly with the developers wanted to accomplish here and is a killer track to listen to on its own but it wouldn't be what it is without the number one theme and the number one best boss theme in the Soul series gwyn lord of cinder you can't pay homage without a source and I think it's hard to argue there's a boss tune more iconic throughout the franchise win goes pling pling plong epic style indeed he does my friend indeed he does the haunting piano after your trek through all the [ __ ] and monstrosity you face through the dead and dying world really conveys the fact that whilst your journey may be at an end the tale isn't a triumphant one it really hammers home the sombre themes that are consistent in the souls games you hit the nail on the head more doubt take the majority of today's list as evidence most these themes are highly regarded for their ability to communicate emotion in a meaningful way one of the most prominent being sorrow I'm all for sunshine and roses but I value being able to lose myself in a desolate unforgiving world of souls when the urge strikes when it does I'm reminded of the tragedies around every turn no matter whether you want to Harold in the age of dark or continue the cycle it's a somber moment to end the husk of a lord who's been kindling the embers leftover the impact has driven home thoroughly through those three notes we know so well and it's a great choice for the series best boss theme with that in the books let's take a look at a few interesting tidbits I pulled from the survey data as you can see on the screen there's quite a disparity in the themes that receive top 50 voting Dark Souls 3 handily received the most votes in the series distantly followed by blood-borne and Dark Souls I'd give it up to blood-borne though it stood tall being one of the only two exclusives on the list speaking of exclusives can we sort out the publishing [ __ ] that is Demon Souls and get a remake please tower night and penetrators huh ah-ha-ha-ha deserves more recognition and maintenance try not fighting to be in at least the top 15 is a travesty in my mind which is the track of him playing to this point by the way if you like what you've been hearing meanwhile Dark Souls 2 received lackluster voting across the board with its highest ranking boss sir alone making number 22 in the voting but still only receiving recognition from less than 5% of total voters I have to admit it's not a shocker I couldn't tell you a single memorable theme from that game meanwhile psyche Row also received a small bit of support but did have both the sword Saint and divine dragon cracked atop 20 I have to say I really expected to find dragon to receive more love but I do understand that many found psyche Rose soundtrack overall to be underwhelming compared to the series track record finally I want to shout out a few themes other than made in Australia the desert more love first Lawrence the first by car many of the bosses toward the top of the list are all considered top tier quality but Lawrence managed to claw his way to number 18 despite the sizable hatred he Garner's because he has a fantastic theme I'm gonna toss two comments up on the screen that I encourage you to take the time and pause to read for yourselves because they are an excellent dissection on what makes it so good the second and most importantly it's criminal little bosses mediocre as the living failures was graced with such a phenomenal track put some respect on there damn - dad mod is officially giving you homework don't listen to that and come to comment on how hard it slaps out of ten meanwhile it's time for me to take a bit of a breather from the souls boss videos I love coming back and talking about them but I never want things to get too stale I've got some long-standing ideas I'm keeping in mind for them in 2020 so I hope you're enjoying all the other content the channel is expanded too there's a few surprises I've got for the holidays I'm going into overdrive at the top 100 until the end of the year and I've got loads more planned for 2020 I want to thank everyone who voted and all of you that left such incredible comments for me to pick for the video I had a blast reading through them all and of course I want to thank you for watching today much love to you and I'll see you in the next video
