i have found a new call in my life something i've enjoyed so much this last month on runescape and that is invading players houses in pvp worlds i'm talking bots i'm talking plank makers i'm talking high risk fighters any type of person in pvp world with private on we can enter their house invade their house and potentially kill them for their loot and since any death inside of the house is a safe death you have to kill this person twice one time inside the house and one time outside of the house so it's very difficult to accomplish but i will do my best to make this happen hope you guys enjoy [Music] yeah he's in his house wait he's gone [Music] okay i'm attacking [Music] okay i killed him [Music] he's dead what big coin stack in la runes 936k all right first house invasion completed and that's when i saw him the description down below i will be scouting on four accounts at the same time and in this occasion we found some high-risk terror figures in camelot [Music] yo what is this this kind of scrubby to be honest it says it's running he's out he's out this is a kill we got one good fight sir good fine we got some loot over here look at that first high-risk speaker we have killed oh look at that six mil pk doing house invasions as a solo peak here is usually very very difficult and for this reason i sometimes took help from my friend in this case spam back yeah i'm ready i'm ready i'm ready he's tv he's not moving dbs quick come on double claw oh my god come on come on dude good fight here we go we got him santa giant coins please feel like horse champ uh 1.6 mill oh solid not bad so normally i don't see any satisfaction by peaking a normal iron man in pvp worlds but there are plenty of normal ironmen running planks in pvp world with private on and for educational purposes everyone must die no special treatment at all yep that's the way to do it sad af he says good fight hyrum to beast is down for cash there's a 65k cash deck right there 141k i've scouted a pk with the name 90 fireflies his house is in relica wait he just got to his house oh i killed him i killed him [Music] 842k there he's back in london now so there's another group who have started invading houses and they are taking all my customers all my clips so i'm gonna attempt to add to them i'm gonna change in game name twice so they think i am a plank making bot we're gonna try to go for him there he is this is the guy who's doing the exact same thing as i want so this guy is actually the youtuber pip and me and my friend pinpack we have decided that the best way to approach this situation and kill pip is by having pimp pimpact be the one invading my house and teaming up with pip and then as i get outside of the house i will attempt to kill pip [Music] here we go we're fighting him alright i'm gonna dd britain [Music] he's dead i got him i got it he was doing the exact same thing i was doing here we go look at the loot the thing is i know who he is it's pip the youtuber and he got finessed and and we got a solid 3.3 mill from pet i just told him the youtuber eliot uploaded a video about house invasions and this attracted more house invaders and for this reason i kept on anti-picking the house invaders wait someone's in my house he's dead how is he alive [Music] he's dead i got him i got someone let's go of course he says we made uh this was a smaller kill though but we made 1.5 mil from that kill yes all right i'm happy with that i'm happy with that you know the first house invader i decided to end pk peep we actually ended up teaming up together and we found someone at brimhaven yeah just 200 lawrence you didn't have a cash stack oh this overlord is as well one two one he's too big he's trying to go out i'll just dice this 100k risk no way he just got the kill like that you really did have 100k all right he's in kami right now he's gonna teleport in three two one we're gonna double call him this time [Music] he's dead [Music] all right this is come on bully stop i can't hit what [Music] barrels there's no escape there is still no escape where is he going good fight sir never down three is down coins and lawrence all right lawrence 300 coins 774k [Music] guys guys look at my screen look at my screen right now i'm looking i'm looking he said please i pay paul game no i got one more cash you are you gonna leave it i i need to know

gotta pick it up you're a horrible person how dare you dude you're the most powerful person right there it was not 60 ml it was 1 mil and 337 k please don't download me he's coming out one show [Music] he comes across and he's dead down wait hashtag it's a solid 50k cash yeah he banged it after he saw me wait oh he's trolling it's a full inventory of spades and a rope having t beat in his
