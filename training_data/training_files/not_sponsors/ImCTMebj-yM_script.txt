hey what is going on you guys it is mr no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today we bring you loot from 40 000 warped jellies all done by our good friend wiggy of the channel the reason this huge amount of jellies were killed was mainly because we wanted to do loot from 1 000 hard clue scrolls which is completed and it's on its way for you all within the next week and that will be a very memorable video and it was all because of these jellies that that video could be possible so i'm really looking forward to showing you guys all of the loot that we got hope you guys enjoyed that edit there so back on track here 40 000 warped jellies all tracked by rune light and all killed by magic the time that wiggy did spend on these jellies was approximately 240 hours averaging about 166 kills an hour and that is included with the time it takes to do each of the hard clue scroll that you know gets dropped occasionally from these jellies obviously if you're not going to be doing the clue scrolls though you can probably kill much more an hour and the thing with this video is most of the drops were not picked up for this simply because the reason that these jellies were killed was just for the hard clues but since runelight was able to track every kill and there is a decent amount of footage recorded all 40 000 drops will be shown at the end of the video as a matter of fact on january 29th 2020 i did upload a video called loot from 3000 warp jellies and just in the clue scrolls in that i made over 8 mil i think from the normal loot i made about 4 mil plus all the dark totems that these drop on top of all the clue scrolls makes it a pretty good monster to make a video about now as you're seeing here on screen this is the method of killing them the fastest essentially you just bring a dens bulwark to use the special attack and that triggers an attack where it hits every single jelly in the room any jelly that doesn't get hit though you can always bring darts and you can simply just throw them at the jelly and lure it close to you it'll be there in no time and then you just start running through two tiles whether it's up and down or side to side and all those jellies end up just getting stacked up on each other this is where you can use ice burst ice barrage it really just depends on your budget whether you're doing a quick slayer task or if you're just gonna camp these for clue scrolls smartest method is definitely ice burst it'll save on supplies and definitely resources since this is an iron man account just the runes used were 350 000 chaos runes 50 000 of blood runes and 300 000 death runes spending that much money on a main account let alone an iron man that has a 173 mil cash stack is absolutely ridiculous and that cash stack because of this video did end at 86 mil so used about 87 mil cash wiggy did at the mage shop for all the runes just for this one and it is important to note that when you do kill multiple jellies two or more in the same tick with the same ice burst spell which does happen occasionally it could only count as one kill so even if the loot tracker might say 40 000 it could actually be 41 or maybe 42 000 and it was also checked if roon light loot tracker did count more than one kill when two were killed in the same tick and sometimes it does count all of them but sometimes it doesn't so we really weren't knowing how to determine that but at the end of the day it's definitely going to be at least forty thousand so i think that's all that matters and imbued heart was critical for this video because you know you wanna just get the most mage dps you can kodai wand also saves on the water runes so it's good that this ironman account had so much unlocked and accessible not to mention full ancestral as well and just a little bit about the uh warp jelly it is a stronger variant of the normal jelly i'm sure everyone remembers the normal jellies and the freminik slayer cave good old nostalgic monster where you can always expect that rune full helm drop and you really only need to bring d-hide to kill them well the same goes for these warp jellies they were released in 2016. they have a magical melee hit so like i said just bringing d-hide or carol's armor is gonna be uh pretty good for you and you can safe spot these ones with range um i'm not too sure if you can safe spot the other ones i'm pretty sure you can but it's cool that you can safe spot these in the catacombs if you're a lower level the drops are actually not that bad you can expect roon kite shields rune full helms and adamant battle axe axe and also a two-hander so definitely bring alex here as it goes for the runes you can expect chaos and death runes so the more mage you use and the more runes you pick up the more runes you'll get back i would also recommend a ring of wealth because they have four different coin drops but all that information that i just said is really relating to if you're using melee here or if you're a lower level most people want to power through this slayer task most people don't kill this monster unless it's a slayer task so magic is the way to go in 2021 if you want to stack these jellies up and kill them all at once rather than all one at a time and with all that being said it is time to look at the loot tracker see how much was made in 40 000 kills and there you have it ladies and gentlemen at 71.8 million 895 rune kites 5200 adamant battle axes 105 000 chaos runes and 20 000 at death runes total magic xp earned 21 million total hp xp earned 11.4 million not to mention 283 ancient shards which will charge arclight for a very long time to come 55 dark totems shown just in this tab here one rune spear one dragon spear which is uh very fascinating that there was only one of those seen throughout all these kills just about 3.5 million gp not that many diamonds at all which is really surprising but i guess a gym bag would still be worth bringing regardless and it is important to note that the first 17 000 warp jellies were killed with ice barrage so that's why blood runes were included uh before when mentioned but later on it was smarter to just end up switching to ice burst really saves on supply costs in general based on all the loot that you guys just saw you can understand why bringing alex here would be worthwhile especially if you're gonna be camping here for a while and let's not forget about the elephant in the room the 971 hard clue scrolls that are also in that price check that is simply incredible that is going to be a separate video that is all at 1 000 now a little more than forty thousand had to be killed to finish the full 1k but we are really excited and a huge shout out to wiggy for putting in all these months to make this happen really gonna make some great videos on this loot channel for you guys this year we have a thousand hardclues 100 master clues 5 000 dragon emps and a humongous scotizo video planned all for next week unfortunately i do have to go out of town in the next hour got some family things going on so be in florida for a few days but when i get back all these videos are coming to you live thank you guys very much for everything and until next time mr no sleep out
