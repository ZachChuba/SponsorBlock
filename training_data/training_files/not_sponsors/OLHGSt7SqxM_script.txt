by the way that wasn't time travel there were just a couple pizzas on the counter I grabbed him Rick and Morty makes a point of avoiding time travel time travel is a real shark jumper and that's why Rick's box of time-travel stuff is literally on the shelf it's on the shelf Rick and Morty's aversion to this plot device might seem surprising given that one of the show's biggest influences is the most iconic time travel movie ever [Music] Rick and Morty was born as the real animated adventures of doc and Marty and the central duo clearly descends from the unconventional partnership of Doc Brown and Marty McFly the pilot even jokingly mentions time-travel but this is really a Back to the Future homage but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken leg serum at every corner drugstore time-travel plays into a number of Rick and Morty's major influences while Rick and Morty treats time-travel as a joke this is a totally unregistered crossed temporal asteroid if we look deeper at the symbolism of time travel and the thematic point that it's making in Back to the Future we can see this movie's legacy very clearly in Rick and Morty both stories are ultimately about connecting with family and gaining greater perspective but I want to tell you that it's been education so here's our take on how Rick and Morty carries on the heart and soul of the time travel story and its goal of giving us insight to see what really matters and what really doesn't nothing you think matters matters [Music] click the link in the description below to sign up now a kid in a family that's not relating to each other they get the standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid I mean look I think the woman was born and done travels back in time and gains the perspective to see his parents as human beings so these strangers sharing the same blood learn to see each other and relate with respect and back in the present their lackluster reality is transformed into a model of domestic bliss Rick and Morty is likewise speaking to the ways that family members struggle to relate vast gulfs developed between the people who are supposed to love each other most of all in part due to the time and experiences that separate generations and also knock next time you know I mean I'm sitting in here I'm 14 I got a computer in here you know oh I think I understand as we see in today's boomer millennial and zoomer animosity generational divides can seem so impenetrable that connecting with each other might as well require time travel back to the future made this literal when Marty had to meet his parents at his age to understand them and the episode Big Trouble in Little Sanchez gives us the variation on this idea when Rick's teenage clone allows his grandkids to connect with a younger more open version of him so it's tiny Rick your brother or cousin or my grandpa just transferred his consciousness into a clone of himself so he could be in our high school Rick is a more cynical blunt version of doc but doc did rip off a bunch of terrorists to steal plutonium they want me to build him a bomb so I took that plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb KC full of use pinball machine parts in the context of this wholesome American 1985 picture he is a crazy bordering on amoral adventurer all that talk about screwing up future events the space-time continuum well I figured what the hell Doc's love story and back to the future part three exposes the Buried romantic underneath this clear-eyed rational mind Rick to has a secretly feeling side and he makes Doc's cross temporal romance look conservative when he falls for a collective hive mind on the surface marty mcfly obviously appears a lot cooler than morty both dream of a future with a girl named Jessica or Jennifer but Marty's girl Jennifer dotes on him while Morty's crush jessica is way out of his League Morty stop being a creepy perverted cyber stalker I'm not cyber stalking I just wanted to know where she got this necklace from over time though Morty's adventures with Rick make her notice him Wow did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal there Marty right yeah get his number later and really in both iterations what does make this character interesting is his weirdly close relationship with this much older and wiser eccentric scientist this so-called dr. Brown is dangerous he's a real nutcase as impossible as it may seem without time-travel Rick and Morty demonstrate that cross-generational relationships and taking the effort to try to understand someone a lot older or younger than you can make you a far more nuanced human being on their own both Rick and Morty are fairly limited Rick representing the past is dated incorrect unwilling to address his illness and toxic behavior morty representing the future is empty he knows nothing and has nothing to offer but a ball of embarrassing teen impulses but together these two correct each other's faults and grow into so much more just as the past and the future in conversation form a richer present the main characters in Rick and Morty also mirror the arcs of the other family members in Back to the Future Marty's dad George McFly has to learn self-respect don't you let people walk over you now I'll be walking over you for the rest of your life in the same way Jerry also has to pull himself together to be more than the loser everyone sees when they look at him I started today disgusted and embarrassed to be your son and then later I thought we were gonna die because you're a loser there's no more let's go in our era though being a real man is it just about being brave and strong against bullies no [ __ ] you leave her alone it's also about developing thoughtfulness and sensitivity I want to hear you say it look I'm a closeted racist and I'm sexist and selfish and I dragged us all into my sexist racist bad things because I'm stupid now you're gonna help me right she just did Marty's mom Maureen and Beth Smith both present too strikingly different selves the unsatisfied unhealthy version of Lorraine we first meet is a result of the timeline in which she falls for Marty's dad George because she pities him he seemed so helpless like a little lost puppy and my heart just went out to them yeah mom we know you've told us the story a million times you felt sorry for him pity draws Beth to marry Jerry - she feels sorry for you you act like prey but you're a predator both of these women are repressing important aspects of themselves in an effort to appear normal and nice Lorraine is judgmental and prudish she tells Marty good girls don't chase boys it's terrible girls chasing boys When I was your age I never chased a boy or called a boy or set parked car with a boy while in the past we see this is exactly what she's driven to do when she likes someone how did you know I was here Marty this may seem a little forward but I was kind of wondering if if you'd ask me to the enchantment under the sea dance on Saturday Beth is pretending to be the nice normal mom when really inside she's a Rick and the ugly truth has always been that I'm not that great a guy and you're exactly like me the healthy Lorraine at the end of fact of the future part one comes from the timeline in which she fell for George because he impressed her are you okay [Music] why the healthier Beth we see at the end of season three fears she's a clone just as Marty's mom is changed so much she seems like a different person and the happier Beth also feels love for her husband that's founded on respect this isn't the woman you married Jerry because this woman loves you after Marty's interference in the past his parents are deeply in love thirty years later so both stories underline that in order to have a healthy relationship you have to cultivate an honest approach to life and respect for both yourselves and each other dad you can't talk to Jerry that way anymore now Jerry and I are happily married parents like Marty's older sister Linda summer is modern and boy-crazy in their unhappy versions both are desperate to meet a guy when how much just ever need anybody summer thanks to time travel and adventures they get more well adjusted and luckier in love also like Marty's older brother Dave summer vacillates between being an underwhelming average teen teenage girl stuff and a sophisticated positive role model what do you want Dave Marty I always wear a suit to the office listen to it tiny Rick feel what he's feeling and back to the future these dual versions of each person are in either/or whereas in Rick and Morty the positive and negative variations coexist more within the same character Jerry improves and then back slides just as we do in our lives still the same fundamental message comes through we all have healthy and unhealthy iterations of ourselves within and we determine which self wins out through our choices after spending a lot of time unpacking how the past rigidly determines the future if they can't - they can't kiss if they can't kiss they can't fall in love and I'm history the Back to the Future trilogy emphasizes free will regan morty also subtly underlines this truth and how rick for all his genius can be in denial of it the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control you chose to come here you chose to talk to the little my vocation just as you chose to become a pickle as daunting and overwhelming as existence is we have agency to determine the kind of people we are I've always told you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything if you think about it relationships with older and younger family members are a form of time travel the only known version available to human beings by getting to know the oldest members of our family we carry on a past we never lived by impacting the youngest members we imprint something of ourselves on to the future which will outlive us these aren't just old pictures they're our family these are counting on us to remember them so you might say that love passed down from our elders to our descendants is the real time travel we take part in love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space the magic of deep paths interacting with distant future goes some way in explaining the special connection between the two central characters in Rick and Morty there's a unique bond between the oldest and the youngest member of a family because there's the most time between them they're farthest away from each other in their perspectives and this foreignness means each bring something novel and surprising to the other you know Rick when I first saw those Rick's and Morty's I thought gee I kind of do values our bond but then I realized it just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines the way they complement each other on their two ends of the time spectrum is captured in the first episode of season four when Rick and Morty each explore an opposite lesson about the best way to balance the present and future I was living in the moment all day and it kept getting me killed by Nazis I think while the show may find traditional time travel too tired and messy Star Trek Terminator time cop time after time quantum leap wrinkle in time somewhere in time a Double Diamond shot it carries on the zany off-the-wall spirit of time-travel classics through messing with time in other ways like fracturing it to create hypothetical realities or freezing it so the characters can clean up after a house party how long do you guys want a week a month can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel what a waste of time we can see all of the classic time travel story lessons scattered throughout Rick and Morty too each time you guys it's incredibly irresponsible and you did it so we could clean the house after a party look there's no time to hold the accountable Maury the most common reason for wanting to travel to the past is to fix something you wish had gone differently so at its core the time travel movie is an expression of one of humankind's four most haunting emotions regret wreck may know enough not to do with some of these naive time travelers attempt but there is a palpable regret in him shaping and informing the decisions he makes in the present we don't know exactly what is the source of Rick's past heartache it could be the lost wife he condors in his possibly fake origin story repressed guilt over his failures as a parent or a Morty that he lost or wronged yet the sense of futility that pervades his thought and his constant assurances that nothing matters when you know nothing matters the universe is yours fit with the mentality of a person who wishes his own past could be changed you want to protect it from a universe that takes whatever it wants it took my wife it clearly took something from you time-travel stories can also be a means of hypothetical anthropological experiment and social commentary that's how mittens on munch of paradise your breed made a copy eight years ago HG Wells The Time Machine imagines inequality taken to such an extreme that class divides yield two separate species and one eats the other it's easy to see that Rick and Morty has this characteristic of the time travel story in spades blowing open the format to include many many more possibilities through the alternate realities of the multiverse you have a whole planet making your power for you that's slavery it's society they work for each other Morty they pay each other but just sounds like slavery with extra steps some of the best Rick and Morty episodes have a knack for reflecting human society and mixing poignant observations in with the absurdity same old story Morty's killing Morty's in the end the time travel story is about stepping out of you're limited in the now point-of-view to see more deeply into the nature of our existence and what's important and this space-time continuum bending perspective is exactly what Rick and Morty has to offer the show's superpower is the way that it takes you out of your assumptions looks at things sideways and all kinds of ways and offers up possibilities you've never considered nobody exists on purpose nobody belongs anywhere everybody's gonna die there is one form of time travel none of us can escape the incessant forward motion of aging with the endpoint of death what is life how can someone so talented die so young what is being young I'm not young I'm old I'm gonna die we change so much over the decades that we are not the same people Beth's sphere that she's not herself after she figures out how to be happy with her family captures the feeling of not recognizing yourselves as you age if I were alone would you tell me yet so often our minds want to move in the other direction as the last line of the great gatsby puts it so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past he talked a lot about the past as if he wanted to recover something we are all constantly living in both future and past and plenty of other alternate timelines all at once take us back memories those that carries forth dream so like Marty and Morty the best thing we can do is realize this open our eyes to the bigger picture and all the timelines we're inhabiting then after zooming out we can zero in on what we care about make choices and take control of where we're going in the time we have left face my whole life I got ambitious man this video is sponsored by the link in the description below to check it out today [Music]
