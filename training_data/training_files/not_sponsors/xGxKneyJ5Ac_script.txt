here's how this video is going to work the next part of this video is a short video essay entirely written by an algorithm that algorithm was trained by looking through dozens of scripts from top YouTube creators and instructed to write something similar when given a writing prompt whatever the algorithm wrote I then performed and animated after the video essay I will then show you how I did this and why machine learning is here to stay on YouTube keep an ear out and see if you can hear the influence of some of your favorites educational channels an SSL favorite cloud aspect ratio of the story continues in bowing up feeling Netflix materials put new testing that the proto version Union takes their screens with the owned of the math and the suburbs is beginning to be budging warm during the time the protagonist is in the script and if you do some of them and then set me that you can do to make sure that you're going to be rid of this to fill in the algorithms and if you have a lot of artificial core writing Jane's incredibly important to tech the channel on the music plan check it out we can also say that you can do something else don't worry I'll need to do is if you want to learn the fundamentals to music keys because the most important feeling serves by the gap piece of writing including the song and then modify your runs and give it a bit more useful he's going to be listening to it so if you want to keep going helps that simple analysis is a lot of composition anyway years for watching if you want to help make these videos possible please consider supporting

useful by infinite eleven in situations who was a pretty staff song take dark steel but if you virgin them and if we attacking the notes for a less part we get something but biological you have to do those things first if you want to learn the are talked effectively if you have a much straightforward tool for instance if you want to keep going to create a lot of different answers behind Latin give us a Utah is rap we get a bit of a completely short piece of cooking and tends to be pretty fun to approach your flats in the spreadsheet Jacques which will be truly library as a dog or interact and to explain that in the end of exercise comes out on the rover word job or pre-plan and you can do those we've lowest alarm sending learning and learning your reading drill becomes slice and I saying that you can do be doing on pipe that the first bill I am souvenir I think that's the fangs he was defined by a resort for dark or full I am shooting hope I want to work on it law to the components of the instruments I didn't guess whether you can do an external into your Brando system and night and I'm shorter earns about the ingenuity selection so measuring luck technical watching start at the link below okay I never said it was going to be good so how did I do this and why is this relevant to YouTube specifically I made this video using machine learning which is a fancy way of saying that I used statistics and a bunch of data machine learning can be used for a variety of applications including image processing product recommendations autonomous driving but they all boil down to one key principle that is you take a bunch of relevant data and use that to inform a statistical structure and that structure will then if you give it new data which you haven't seen before it will give you an output specifically for this video I built a statistical structure by a computer code which predicted which word was most likely to follow a given sequence of words consider the incomplete sentence cars without human if you were to ask a person to predict which word came next they would probably say drivers or maybe inputs this is because humans understand how language works and imply from context that human here is an adjective rather than a noun cars have drivers and so maybe the noun following the adjective is drivers a machine has no innate understanding of how our language works and so can't make a prediction based on context so how do you train it to write mystics and data I gather data from a variety of amazing YouTube creators I received written scripts for videos made by real engineering draw a SETI Wendover productions tear z12 tone college info geek lessons from the screenplay and then I added scripts for my videos into the mix as well for good measure I then took all the scripts and bung them into one big file and told the computer to look at the first 100 words given the first 100 words and all the words that the one hundred and first could possibly be ie all the words that appear at some point in the document which one did it think it was it took a guess in this first instance a totally random guess and if it was right then it changed the statistics that governed its prediction to make it more likely to predict that word in the future when faced with the same 100 input words in that order if it was wrong then it made it less likely to predict that word when faced with the same inputs it then moved along by one word considering words 2 to 101 and tried to predict the 100 and second word depending on if he got it right or not it made a correction to the internal statistics and then moved on it did this for every 100 words segments of the file so as it moved through all the data it got better and better at making predictions but by the time it reached the end of the file it had only seen some combinations of words once other combinations would be more popular so to improve the learning it then went back to the start the file and repeated the whole process several times after doing that it was then capable of writing text given a 100 word writing prompt after taking in those 100 words it's predicted word is added onto the end of the writing prompt and so included in the input data which was now 99 provided words and one machine predicted word it then repeats the process predicting a word based on the input which has then added to the end of the prompt write more than 100 words in a row and the machine is now working out what to write next given what it has written before with no more the video essay in this video was the product of the computer writing 500 words given my introduction and it did some stuff surprisingly well for instance it really nailed the end of the video just in the middle so as far as I can tell this was a mishmash of lots of different outros from 12 tones videos but they followed enough of a pattern that the algorithm just recognized what was going on and recreated it but then carried on to the next script so remember that all the scripts were on one file one after the other so apparently my writing prompt was interpreted by the algorithm as being the middle of a video rather than the start one of the key things to note is that obviously the script doesn't make any sense on a gross scale but the individual sentences sometimes I don't want to say for the most part it makes sense in other words the script learned the basic grammar and there are a couple of more complex structures like clauses but the sentences in context don't make any sense and apart from a couple of examples there isn't really any consistent vocabulary between them I think this is because I trained the algorithm on lots of different YouTube creators and they did very different things they made videos about music theory or about studying or about aeroplanes and so the algorithm ended up being an uneasy compromise between all of their different styles and all of their different specific vocabularies I suspect that if you train the bots using just one channel scripts although they'd have to have a lot of them that you'd end up with a better performing more targeted but similar to those which are already being used to write each of videos algorithmically generated videos have been active on this site for years producing highly targeted videos mostly aimed at children that's because a there's a very large market for children's videos and B those videos tend to be very simple as this video is demonstrated video essays are very complicated to write they need to be succinctly to be both ideally entertaining and informative and they have to have an overarching points there has to be an argument this project took me several weeks to code and run even on high end machinery however as processor technology evolves more sophisticated algorithms are developed and crucially more data becomes available as more videos are uploaded to YouTube and can be scraped for their content expect to see more algorithmically generated videos like this one and in the future they might actually make sense but that will be only one example of machine learning revolutionising the world I mentioned earlier that autonomous vehicles are powered by machine learning and in the future we can expect our roads to be mostly populated by self-driving vehicles but it doesn't stop there if machines have learned to drive why limit them to roads why not let them loose on a racetrack driverless cars could compete with one another with teams laboring to engineer not just the fastest car but also the smartest AI to pilot them that would be much more complex than what I've done here the AI would need to manage battery power know when and how to overtake safely and adapt to changing weather conditions it would be incredibly exciting to watch and follow the development it would be a whole new hybrid of sport and technology except this is already happening and it's sponsoring this video and also a massive thank you to all the channels who volunteers their scripts to be used as training data that we links to all of those channels in the description as well also linked in the description is a video where I talk to the code of how I made this in much more detail that's available exclusively from a patreon so if you'd like to watch that then please consider supporting the channel thank you very much for watching the video and I'll be back next month with some more machine learning which is going to be a lot more driving based I'll see you then thanks very much for watching
