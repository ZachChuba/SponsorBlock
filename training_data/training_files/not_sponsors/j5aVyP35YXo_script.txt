well hello and welcome to this week's video and something a little bit different for you this week today I'm going to be taking you on a little tour around the Museum of Flight in Seattle and aside from that I went on a little bit of a wander a rounding field in Seattle and found something that was really interesting you'll see later in the video but watch the video and I hope you enjoy it let's head to Seattle and take a walk around the museum of flight first and then go and see some 737s in a car park let's go thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video well this is a convenient thing to do for a few hours isn't it what's on the other side of the airport the Museum of Flight but we need to come here for absolutely years wasn't expected to be here today but with this delay well I might as well come and check it out the Museum of Flight in Seattle is at Boeing Field about a 50 minute drive from Seattle Tacoma Seattle's main international airport my flight had suffered a five-hour delay out of Seattle so this seemed like a great place to come and pass some time this 737 was retired by US Airways in 1995 after fly-in since 1969 [Music] I can't believe it's actually taken me this long to get to the Museum of Flight here in Seattle this place is incredible I've always kind of dismissed it as a bit kind of too geeky but it really isn't it's a really good Museum and they've got some incredible artifacts in it so I'm mating era that's our 71 Blackbird over there why it is such a mix as well it's not just a military stuff why a lot of museums are the loads of civil stuff there's some of the really historical planes is a 737 over there the nose of a 737 I so need one of these things look at this flying car good lord the Taylor era car from 1968 like years ago people full of these will be the future of fly I mean who knew that the future flying said was sitting on a Ryanair or spirit playing from the infinitive hours when this was how the future was in position or so ago when we bring them back and where else in the world can you get this close to an sr-71 blackbird Wow incredible look at this thing so here's where there's some really good stuff hey look how that it's a Concord amazing don't have a lot of pretty on board wow they can actually come and get on board Concord Wow it's Conchords on loan to the museum from british airways and it's one of four on display outside of europe the British Airways one as well [Music] very cold [Music] there's not much room on the old cohort is they don't even flat beds like this for a three-hour flight from London you know you don't need it most tiny windows really have on designed for GoPros I to be attached to I think the people who have stepped foot on this plane there [Music] think of the people who have beats this bathroom celebrities kings world leaders [Music] whoo mushroom to do you around toilet review there was there [Music] [Music] [Music] and an old 707 air force one year Wow and he gambled this one as well how often and you say you've been on an Air Force One you great one to do a trip report on [Music] [Music] [Music] now this is the presidential toilet while the presidential toilet [Music] even though windows very nice it's got some toilet roll as well very thoughtful of him [Music] which one I have flat screen TVs back in the 1960s not very ahead of that years these presidential halt [Music] of course he's got a coach class section where the self-loading freight goes onto the back [Music] if I have an air force one of my own I think I'd do the same thing you know I'd have to be big presidential room and bedroom and everything of the Front's and then back here the rest of the family kids become like a nice quiet the 727 never got to ride one of these [Music] this Boeing 727 was the original prototype of the 77 and it was the first 727 ever built it first fell over in 1963 almost delivered to United Airlines in 1964 before being retired in the 1990s and restored over many years by the Museum of flies the old United Airlines upholstery on the seats always reminds me of the National Express upholstery on of all the coaches from back in the 1970s if I was well there is the queen of the skies 747 it's the very first one incredible I can't wait to have a look at a lemon actually that's museum is incredible that's a long way [Music] good lord how big these things are they're not crammed full of C's Wow it's a Boeing a380 it really is incredible to be able to walk through such a famous historical aircraft and also to see what these test aircraft are like inside wow this place is this thing is incredible a 747 NT geez Louise often this equipment that they obviously used to test it when it was being designed this aircraft was a prototype 747 and the one that launched the entire seventh or second program I think they found a real-life 737 max engineer looking pretty confused nice lack true it's not a bad place to spend a few hours is it now here's a random fact for you this aircraft here is the Antonov an-2 and if you have a private pilot's license in Europe for a single-engine fixed wing type so that it's basically ancestors and your Piper's and things this is the biggest type that you can fly on a private pilot's license with no additional ratings how cool is that will be amazing to flow one of these when I have my license squarespace.com slash not phillips and using coupon code and all Phillips so here's just Southie Boeing 737 max a aircraft that Boeing I've got ports up at the moment they're brand new just been built and stood here waiting for whatever fix they need to be able to actually take to the skies another one over here nine air calm charlie nine air calm Chinese daylight good lord so over there is the employee parking lot at Boeing I've heard about this place look at that it's the employee carpark and it's absolutely rammed full of 737 max aircraft Jesus prices dozens of them what [Music] let's go and see if we can take a closer look at these jeez Louise one two three four five six seven eight I've lost count as like at least thirty at 7:37 spots over there good lord knowing have built over 400 737 max aircraft that haven't even been delivered yet and they're stored all around the u.s. it does feel pretty sad seeing so many aircraft parked up like this just brand-new and waiting to be delivered I mean what airlines have we got I thought look son wing Icelandair tui loads of them China's Southern Air Canada it's hair occasionally I've got loads over there as well incredible this Wow flydubai ooh good lord I've seen pictures of it on the internet but just looking at it up close it's incredible Wow all of these planes parked up are waiting software updates when they've actually fixed them so that they can actually finally get delivered to their Airlines after the issues that they've had with the max I mean just imagine the chaos he's causing for Boeing at the moment unbelievable so there we have it the museum of flight and how crazy is that all of those 737 max seats just parked up in a car park in Seattle absolutely unreal and we thought that the max eight issue was the biggest aviation thing to happen in a generation and then here we are sitting with the current issues that are going on around the world and it just all kind of it's crazy absolutely crazy I
