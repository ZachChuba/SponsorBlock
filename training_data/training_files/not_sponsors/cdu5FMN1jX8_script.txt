hey what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome it to a brand new loot video for you all today so today I bring you all a non monster related loot video this is none other than loot from 10000 caskets first things first these caskets are not related to clue scrolls in any way these are actually tradable caskets that you can get from the grand exchange or just by trading other players in game in order to purchase them in bulk the reason that you would purchase these from other players in bulk is because you can only buy a limit of about 50 every 6 hours in the grand exchange so that is optional on how you want to buy them so for this video I did spend about 1.2 K on every single casket individually and therefore the start amount for this video was exactly 12 mil since we did have just about 10,000 caskets overall the goal for this video was to see if we would profit or lose money by opening every single one of them and although I did want to upload loot from 10000 Christmas crackers before this video I did have to delay that video for numerous reasons right now so I figured I would just upload this in the meantime so with all that being said I hope you guys enjoy today's video I'm feeling much better finally got rid of the flute oh yeah let's get into it so for these 10,000 caskets about half of them were purchased in the grand exchange using my main account as well as three other accounts that all have membership took about six to seven days to obtain about 5000 and then I didn't need a via nother 5000 for this video so what I did was while I was live-streaming I would basically just ask anyone who was available to buy them for me and you know they would wait a few days and then come trade me a few days later and then they would in return give me a lot more than just fifty so thanks to anyone who did it provides some caskets for this vid I did buy most of them for 1.2 K each from these people as well so the cost remained at 12 mil overall and also a fun fact by the time that I was done purchasing the last couple thousand the GE price managed to raise all the way up to 3k so I think because of using multiple people's assistance we did actually raise the demand for these low tier caskets and managed to significantly change the price at the very end of it so I might have actually cost that people money but they assured me that it was okay they were happy to assist with the video normally though if you were to just you know slowly purchase ten thousand in the grand exchange I don't think the price would change significantly I just think that so many people were buying so many at one time that probably just had an effect on the price overall so as I was recording this video today and voice over again I did notice that the price did go back down to one point two K so I'm assuming that people somehow do obtain a lot of these caskets on a daily basis due to all the monsters that can be killed in runescape that dropped them and there are also other ways to obtain these low tier caskets which I will get into in a little bit but for now let's talk just a little bit about the monsters that do give you them in the game though first we have the Dagon it's at water birth island the barrel from the vie LD caves giant sea snakes king sand crabs ammo Knight crabs Dagon ah--this rock crabs sand crabs swamp crabs giant rock crabs giant lobsters river trolls mummies and of course the sea snake hatchling as well as the sea snake younglings you can also obtain these caskets from the npc quizmaster if you are going to be choosing the mystery box rather than the 1,000 coin reward for any iron men who may still do that random event I don't think Mane's do too many randoms then if you open a mystery box I do believe you can receive a casket from that as well and out of all of those methods of how caskets can be brought into the game I am assuming that most caskets that currently come into the game on a weekly basis are from the list of crabs mentioned above I see a lot of people training at all sorts of different crabs especially lower levels and that could potentially bring a lot of these caskets into the game since the drop rate is only one in 128 and these crabs can be killed pretty fast as well as in mass quantities at one time crabs are basically the way that you would train on a lower level account before you start nightmare zone before you start Slayer so with all these people around runescape training it is really no surprise to see that these 10,000 caskets were able to be purchased so easily with no delay and other than the limit you know I'm pretty sure that they would have all bought at the same time now it's anyone who is interested in obtaining these caskets whether you are an Ironman or just a skilar there's a way for you to as well the last method for obtaining these low tier caskets would be big net fishing with a draw operate of one in 200 I remember as a kid doing some cavity big net fishing and obtaining a few caskets over time and from what I remember I would almost always receive gems from them and as you've seen by now the drops from these caskets really haven't changed too much over the years they're not exactly the most impressive like I said before none of these drops relate to clue scrolls neither do the caskets in general I would say they heavily revolve around gems and coins the true definition of treasure which kind of makes sense sapphires emeralds rubies and of course diamonds all of these uncut gems shout out to the Adam Sandler movie just saw it a few days ago can be found through the caskets the rate of the sapphires one in four the emeralds one in 7.7 the rubies one in 17 and the diamond is the rarest at 1 in 64 the most expensive gym is obviously the diamond which has a price range of anywhere from 2.8 to 3 K on a good day and the lowest amount being the sapphire which is just around 500 GP there's six different roles for the amount of coins that you can get highest quantity of being the 640 GP and the lowest one being 20 GP as it goes for the extra uncommon drops those would be the cosmic talismans that's one in sixteen and of course the main value drops being the tooth and the loop key which both happen to be one and 128 as mentioned you know when I was a kid I did see these caskets quite often while doing big net fishing they were released into the game February 27 2002 I was just four years old I'm sure many of us were pretty young back in those days so it's quite a long time ago they are stackable in the bank but they're not stackable in your inventory and another fun fact is the high alcohol use around 30 GP and the weight is around 5 kg per casket one thing I'm not sure of is if I was to wear a ring of wealth while opening these if that would have increased my odds of receiving anything good at while opening I didn't see any mention of that in the old school runescape wiki which I do heavily rely on for these loot videos so if you actually know if wearing a ring of wealth would make these drops more profitable feel free to let me know in the comments below maybe I can do another loop from 10k with a ring of wealth or maybe even a loop from 100k because honestly it's didn't take too long at all to do and comparing them with a ring of wealth it would maybe make for a worthwhile upload if prices right now there is also one other method for obtaining these caskets but I didn't think it was really worth mentioning but I did see it in the wiki so why not there is a reward from allocating workers to fishing and managing miscellanea I think what that means is your workers from miscellanea if you're building a kingdom if you're trying to collect from a kingdom they would be fishing for you and I guess sometimes they would catch these caskets since some of them might be using a big net I don't think many people use their kingdom to gather fish but it is something to keep in mind if none of the methods above sounded good enough to you maybe you can try that out now when I was opening all these caskets it really didn't take too long I was doing them at an average rate of around 2,500 to 3,000 an hour just depending on how afk I was so this video didn't take any longer than three to four hours to actually make the only thing that took long in this video is actually to obtain all these caskets rather than opening them should also do a drinking game anytime you hear the word casket throughout this video take a shot I did decide to open all of them at the fishing guild is where I starts a lot of my loot videos as well as end a lot of my loot videos I did this in a PvP world so I had some privacy I don't mind the skull at the bottom right of the screen and all this video was was mainly just a lot of left clicking as I mentioned before you know they are stackable in the bank and you can pretty much withdraw 28 at a time which means you can open all 28 because they fit perfectly in the inventory and if they ever do have an update to where they would be stacked in the inventory then all the gym jobs would have to be noted and I'm sure that would speed up the already super fast process of opening them up in general I could have used the gym bag for this video as well but I really didn't see the need to seeing as I would have to just bank again for the caskets anyway the main thing that I wanted to do this video for was obviously just to see how much would I lose how much would I make potentially make anyway and obviously the biggest part of the potential profit would be held with the amount of loops and tooth keys that I would see from all 10,000 the price of the keys though being so low these days as well as the one in 128 drop rate pretty much knew coming into this that I wasn't going to profit at all from this video but maybe if those keys ever go up in price and the price of the casket remains the same this could be a moneymaker in the far future it is you know up for debate so we will see as the years go on if these caskets ever do change the less I do consider this loot series to cover every piece of content in runescape whether it be a monster a casket a chest a drawer whatever it is I will get to it one day but overall I do hope you guys enjoy the video I know it was a pretty strange one and the drop table is so small there isn't too much variety but I still think 10,000 was worth uploading I certainly don't think any number below 10k would be worth making into a video this one was pretty fast you know not a lot of effort I think the editing probably took longer than the actual video itself it was kind of difficult to find enough things to say about a casket for 10 minutes you know what I mean but anyway here we are loot from 10,000 complete I did rock the heavy caskets I figured it would be a good fit for this video see I was a pretty fast one let's go ahead and get into the price check see how many coins how many gems talismans and of course keys we did end up with and let's see just how much we made or just how much we lost all right so 10,000 caskets we almost came out with 1 million GP but we did fall short at just about 980 2k your R and G for the gems as well as the talismans and the keys might be different from mine but this should be pretty relatable I imagined 12 mil was spent now it is the moment of truth to see what we are going to end up with so just in the gems it looks like we are just about three point four mil talismans brings us up to four and with all of the keys as well as the GP we are at six point five mill it up from 10,000 caskets which means we did fall short of our goal to profit at around 12 to 13 mil we did go ahead and sell everything to get the overall 100% accurate number I was surprised to see the cosmic talisman sell right away I didn't know who was buying those maybe runecrafting boss maybe someone who's having a talisman collection I'm really not too sure but the overall number is six million five hundred and nineteen thousand which means we did lose money but you know it could have been worse we only lost just about I would say with what I paid probably like six mil you want to be a hundred percent accurate it was more like 5.5 mm but either way we didn't make any money but at least now you guys know of the drops you can expect from these low tier caskets and with all that being said I hope you guys enjoyed today's video I will see you guys tomorrow with either loot from 3000 green dragons or loot from 10,000 Christmas crackers either way I assure you both videos are awesome so yeah January you will see a ton of videos got a lot stockpiled for you all been off a week now so I made up for a lot of that with videos and yeah I'll see you guys later on thank you very much for your time today until next time mister nose sleep ow
