hello everyone dead spikes here today I'm going to be making a ma bean build if you've been in my stream at all you saw me using this build quite a bit I've never made a video on it yet but I am finally going to make one for you guys now this build is used to just take out any types of mobs anywhere in the game the things you need to kill to get up towards the boss wherever you need to kill them that works very great for it I think you'll be quite impressed you never watched one of my build videos before I'm gonna showcase some gameplay to try to persuade you to use this then I'll be going over every aspect of the build that I have this is not the first whenever I make new content for you let's get into the video our first set of gameplay is going to be on the mushroom island or question mark question mark question mark whatever you would like to call it this is where I use this build quite a bit you can see it just absolutely shreds ba muumuus here now mind you I am on one player difficulty because they do not have anybody with me I'm on apocalypse 6 so this is max difficulty solo well this works great no matter how many players are in your lobby absolutely shreds these cows and it has been my fastest way of killing them that I have currently found out so far which is pretty nice pretty nice there you go you guys see me kill some cows let's go to the next area alright we are now at the end of high wall lothric I shadowed on this called high wall I guess I just pulled the Dark Souls reference out hi my apologies in my opinion this is probably the hardest mob spot in the game as you can tell these guys are just bullying me and pushing me around but the act still does its job still doing decently getting that health back killing stuff I've gotten these guys there we go over here I was pretty close these guys are quite tough but just normal mobs and our mobs ain't nothing this those the shield guys they're nice does a lot of damage to you see I'm too shot and a lot of things I'm getting bullied we sustained through it very nice very nice all right you more mobs here keep it goin we got that gong just in case for some extra damage a shadow potion here just a one shot this fool all right now this uh alright let's keep it going by your guys the five guys don't really deal a whole lot of damage I kind of just annoying got some more guys over here there we go that was high wall now let's go over the build all right now that you have saw some gameplay of the build time to showcase what I actually have going on here I have the whirlwind ax this is a very great weapon and if you want to farm it you get it from soggy cave a very easy farm I do have some videos on how to farm that faster I suggest going through my channel if you have not watched them yet now with the whirlwind there is a few different set enchantments you could go with that's not which one was your favorite the one that I have and have been liking a lot is swirly and radiance crit it is very good at mob killing the radiance is gonna keep your house up the swirling just does that nice AoE damage and the critical hit just that extra damage right there now something do people like to argue with me which I completely understand is possibly switching vertical hit or swirling out for rampage and it's perfectly understandable and I do suggest you to do so if you do get one with that roll um test dot which one you like more I think a rampaging might be a little bit stronger than the one I have or maybe mine is stronger not sure both are very good try to get one not too hard to farm next I'm using my favorite armor set which is the renegade armor everybody in the world is trying to get this armor and it's just a pain in the butt the past few streams I've been working really really hard on trying to figure out the best farm for this I don't have the answer yet but it's up to you to go to Arch Haven or fiery Forge any place that drops the mercenary it will drop the renegade the third place is the cacti canyon it's up to you I got lucky and I got mad from the blacksmith and I haven't been able to make a second one spawn yet I will keep trying until I get it we're artifacts for the most part I run double mushroom Gong um something I do need to note with a renegade with the rolls you absolutely want cooldown the other two are up to you I suggest cowardice is one of them and the third one I would say is gravity pulse my god roll is cool down cow nice gravity pulse in my opinion but I think cool-down is the most important cuz it's gonna make it so you can use double mushroom to have infinite mushroom uptime get your increase attack and movement speed um that's why I run dull mushroom cuz I just spin them back and forth to make sure I always have one active the gong is for just in case I need it sometimes there's enchanted enemies that I need to kill so I'll pop the Gong on them I'm just really annoying enemies in general I'm getting overcrowded I pop the gong and my whirlwind is gonna kill all those enemies extremely quick duh more than likely save me um that'll do it for this build this build is really great I do highly suggest you to try it out this is the best mopping build that I have used so far I do have a lot of different weapons in gear that I've been trying to use that's why I'm a ridiculous level as I like to play around with a lot of builds and this currently is my favorite mobbing build helpful content like this I hope you guys have a wonderful day if you're interested in checking out my stream it isn't the pin to comment down below this Mike's out
