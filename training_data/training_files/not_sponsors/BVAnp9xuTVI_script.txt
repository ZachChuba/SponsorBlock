for sponsoring this episode more on them later and a big thank you to Emperor Tiger star on YouTube he animates maps of wars all throughout history if you haven't already be sure to check his channel out he'll be joining us to read out some primary sources from the war with an impressive southern accent I might add I'll be doing the same for his video so be sure to check out my southern accent as well if someone were to ask you what is the costliest war in American history how would you answer many would impulsively respond with the Second World War were even Vietnam however this is simply untrue the American Civil War was and still is the costliest conflict in American history in fact up until about fifty years ago the casualties of the Civil War were higher than any other American wars combined but why was this the case there were few automatic weapons no tanks or high explosives I'm griffin Johnson the armchair historian and today we're going to be examining what exactly made the American Civil War so lethal first it must be understood that far more men died of sickness than combat approximately 67% of all civil war casualties were the result of infectious diseases such as measles dysentery and smallpox this was the natural result of assembling so many men from different areas in one location and was exacerbated by the lack of sanitation and fresh water the loss of men to disease had significant implications on the battlefield for example at the Battle of Chancellorsville 5,000 Confederate soldiers were rendered unfit for duty due to small toques contamination that said disease will inevitably cause casualties in any war however combat in the American Civil War was still exceptionally deadly and this was for a variety of reasons the first reason why combat was so deadly was the extensive use of what is perhaps the most infamous munitions of the war the men a ball which was named after its inventor the French army officer Claude HN Monnet before it's invention rifles which were loaded with musket balls were very slow to reload as their ammunition had to fit tightly into the barrel to accommodate the rifling when they solved this problem by designing a hollow conic bullet which fit loosely in the barrel when the rifle was fired the hollow cavity in the projectile expanded allowing the round to fit firmly against the rifle and giving it a spin which drastically increased accuracy and reload speed however the round itself was slow and heavy and could cause immense damage to the body bones that were hit generally shattered necessitating the amputation of limbs in many cases the rifled muskets weren't the only thing that increased battlefield casualties the most formidable weapon in the Arsenal's of both sides was of course field artillery which was valuable in the 19th century battlefield improvements in weapon technology resulted in artillery being both deadlier and more accurate than ever before explosive shells were able to destroy entire platoons if a direct hit occurred and the introduction of rifled artillery such as the parrot gun made such hits much more likely according to eyewitness sergeant Jonathan stow 15s Massachusetts infantry what sites I've seen that I now see around me shells fly past me every few seconds carrying away branches from trees and scattering limbs around I'm in severe pain Fury's how the shells fly I do sincerely hope that I shall not be wounded again by far the factor most responsible for producing casualties in combat however was the employment of linear tactics as can be guessed such accurate and deadly weapons were devastating to the static formations that were employed on the Civil War battlefield most of the commanders of the war had been trained at the United States Military Academy at West Point in fact at least one army at every major battle that was fought during the war was commanded by a West Point graduate including such commanders as ulysses s grant and robert e lee as the doctrine taught at West Point emphasized Napoleonic era direct approach tactics it's no surprise that both sides deployed their forces in lines and it is equally unsurprising that both sides suffered heavy casualties as a result it did not help that many of the generals appointed during the war had no prior military experience and were promoted due to their political positions however it must be understood that there was no better way to fight in open ground at the time in battles where cover could be used commanders usually deployed them and behind for example at the Battle of Antietam 500 Confederates hidden behind trees walls were able to delay the advance of several Union brigades attempting to cross what would later be named Burnside's bridge the quintessential example of the lethality of civil war combat is the infamous advance at the Battle of Gettysburg ordered by Robert evilly known as Pickett's Charge during the assault 12,500 Confederate infantry men advanced one mile across an open field under very heavy Union rifle and artillery fire although some Confederates reached Union lines the assault was ultimately repulsed with the Confederates taking over 6,000 casualties the range and accuracy of rifled muskets ensured that Lee's men would begin suffering heavily well before they reached northern lines and even before it began the Confederates were being subjected to extensive Union bombardment artillery played such a considerable role in the Civil War that according to Craig Simmons in his book the Battle of Gettysburg the artillery barrage is at Gettysburg may well have been the loudest man-made sound on the North American continent until the detonation of the first atomic bomb and in the words of Colonel Joseph Mayo of the 3rd Virginia infantry who fought at Gettysburg the first shot or two flew harmlessly over heads but soon they began to get the range and then came pandemonium first there was an explosion on the top of the tree and in a second there was another followed by piercing shriek two men were killed outright and three frightfully wounded Company F had suffered terribly and a lieutenant had his legs she had a blow the knee towards the end of the war the deadliness of combat on open fields was finally recognized by commanders of both sides accordingly both the north and south began to employ static defensive positions and breastworks as can be seen at the siege of Petersburg which was also one of the first times that the Gatling gun was employed in battle but in a very limited capacity when the First World War arrived fifty years later the American Civil War was finally seen as both foreshadowing trench warfare and representing the transition from close order formations in open ground to open order formations in cover this lesson however came at the cost of six hundred and twenty thousand American lives eight percent of American males lost their lives in the American Civil War and one in four soldiers would never return home if you want to learn more the armchair historian or by clicking the link in the description below lastly don't forget to check out amber tiger star
