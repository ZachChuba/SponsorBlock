we're approaching a green light there's someone in front of me and the car sees that so it's not asking me to confirm to make it through the light oh that's a good question I don't know this is this is twenty twenty point six point four point that's how I put twenty four point six point one like twenty four point six point one so we're trying to show you how it does all this we're not gonna hit another light for a second here oh really get you in front you think that'll be a good video okay yeah that's a good video idea all right so if you're not familiar with this traffic light control and stop sign control it's in the autopilot menu traffic light and stop sign and control beta basically the way it is now everything's in beta it's always been invaded for autopilot with that feature in particular if you turn it on and there is a vehicle directly in front of you that the auto pilot sees on the screen on the visualization that you don't have to confirm that you're going to a green light but if there is no vehicle immediately in front of you that's going through the green light I don't know if it's just in your lane over to the side to side I don't know how that works then you do have to confirm by either tapping the accelerator if you're in any Tesla or pulling back on the stalk over here there's a stalk on the side of the wheel if you're on a Model S or X with autopilot so you could have one of those two methods to do it but eventually you won't have to do that but for now you do so we'll see if we can get you an example of that where you have to you have to do something and it'll also display if it's going to make you do that right at the bottom of the display it'll show that it will it says like stopping at 500 feet stopping at 400 feet and it'll start to slow down you'll you'll feel it even if you don't see that visual cue alright with this light that truck just went through so it's not asking for confirmation now that truck is way ahead of me I'm not gonna we'll have to try it another intersection all right this intersection we're gonna end up stopping and if you come to a complete stop I don't know if it'll start again it's interesting because when I came to a complete stop with just me in the front and no cars in front it made me start up in this case I don't think we actually came to a complete stop and there are cars in front of me so were going straight through it now let's let those cars it says stopping for traffic control and 500 feet it's telling well it did tell me that let me see what happens here it's seeing that car go through the traffic light it's not asking me to confirm we're just going straight through without confirming there need to be I think all those cars need to be completely out of you to ask to confirm ok it says it's stopping see it says it's gonna stop and so there needs to be someone in my lane not just the adjacent lane because there was a car in the adjacent Lane right there and as you can see it kept telling me was gonna stop it it was it would have made the stop if I didn't do anything so that's what it is for now there's got to be a car directly in front of you or you've got to confirm all right well it wasn't read late we were gonna stop at neck now it's green and of course I'm in the lane without the car again so here I gotta give the little signal confirm I did it on the stalk there instead of the guests or the accelerator pedal like I did last time and it was a yellow light we weren't right right through it it didn't stop for the yellow light so maybe it won't stop for any yellow lights maybe it has to be red I don't even know I don't think they even mentioned that in the description of how this stuff works all right now we know what should happen here right green light nobody in front of me nobody even in the adjacent Lane see it's slowing me down slow me down slow me down it's gonna stops getting red across there but I oh I did the wrong stop confirmation you gotta pull the stock towards you not push it away from you just remember that if you've got a model SRX that's what I did was I push the stock down but you again you can pull the stock towards you or you can push down on the accelerator either one won't get you to work and there's someone stopped in the road over here let's see if autopilot let's see what autopilot does here there's someone stopped in the road well they're signaling that they're not going anywhere so I got it I got it what now they are going somewhere what are they doing alright one last chance here let's get me to show you the hell this works on this traffic light which is green for now it may not be green when we get there but here we go someone's approaching the intersection it's telling me it's gonna stop I'm gonna pull the stock towards me which I just did and we go right through it that's how it works now you know all the details so be sure to like share belphin notifications and we'll see you in the next video oh and something else I've noticed here with this red light watch what does there's a blinking light up here look it's a blinking light the blinking light oh my gosh yeah i v-i you I pulled back on the stock for confirmation but that wasn't obviously any kind of regular old traffic light and it shouldn't have reacted to that but just so you know it's gonna react to those kind of things so you got to be aware that your car is gonna suddenly hit the brakes if you're in that kind of a situation if it has happened to you let me know in the comments and pass this video along to at some point Tesla will figure that out and it won't happen anymore but for now it does so be sure to like share bell--the notifications we'll see you in the next video I hear a train friendly so I I don't have to worry about it right autopilots doing it yeah there it goes all done I still hear the train there's a blinking light above me and it's not responding up its saw it but it didn't really do much you can see it it's all but not like last time but now it's got to confirm confirm
