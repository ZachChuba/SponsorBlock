sponsored by notion in 2016 the iPhone 7 start stat 649 dollars three years later Apple's flagship iPhone costs 54% more it's a small point really but in 2016 the then you 32 gigabyte 4.7 inch LCD iPhone started at 649 and the dual camera 5.5 inch plus version started at 769 in 2019 the now new 64 gigabyte 6.1 inch LCD iPhone with dual cameras starts at $6.99 more memory bigger screen better cameras roughly the same if not slightly better pricing there's no Plus model anymore of course but there is a pro model with a steel frame and OLED display and three cameras that does start at $9.99 but no such model existed back then it's like waiting for Shake Shack to introduce a triple and then claiming burgers are suddenly more expensive at the top-end patty can't be damned stay with me here now when I first got sent this video well before I hit play I guess that the entirety of it was gonna come down to Bill of Materials Plus Apple tax times sheep equals profit I mean I totally hoped for more a deep dive into Apple's margins over time and how they compared to the rest of the industries a breakdown of price versus value where the upfront dollars were measured out over total cost of ownership and of how exactly Apple was providing the kind of value people were willing to pay premium prices for again and again but yeah all I got was Bill of Materials plus Apple tax times sheep equals profit exclamation mark exclamation mark number one which is just such a tire trite old lazy rehashed cliche take on why Apple's products are legitimately more expensive than others so let's do it different now I'm Rene Richie and this is vector the video starts off utterly unsurprisingly with the Apple tax while paying more simply because it's an Apple product which is sort of the cranky way people describe apples prices being higher than competing products now first of all that isn't universally true some products certainly are others price out at about the same or even slightly less if you want that hardware max were generally expensive regardless price is only one aspect of value back in 2016 IBM report on a pilot project to determine what it would cost to deploy max to their workforce their employees wanted them valued everything from the build quality to the user experience but how much more would they cost turns out not more less three times less to manage they ended up saving five hundred and thirty five dollars per Mac over the course of a four-year deployment this year IBM reported much the same again but added that their Mac users were overall happier with the software performed better and were less likely to leave than their counterparts correlation and not causation sure but facts and feels together who'd have thunk it the 256 gigabyte might book path for example plus one thousand two hundred and ninety nine dollars but you can get a more powerful Windows laptop for over a hundred dollars less many times it's not that Apple is more expensive than competitors it's that they simply don't offer budget alternatives beneath the premium models the way many if not all of their competitors do you can get premium laptops from pretty much every company but you simply can't get budget ones from Apple Apple has kept its proprietary lightning connector while removing useful ports like the headphone jack and the sdcard reader it's also worth pointing out that unlike most of their competitors Apple doesn't subsidize their hardware with software or licensing revenues and they're just beginning to with services all of which make hardware profits look downright tiny by comparison instead Apple uses part of the money they make selling atoms to finance the development of all the bits that goes into Mac OS iOS and the rest as well as all the apps that come with them including I work GarageBand and iMovie none of that stuff gets engineered or tested for free but it's part of what every Apple user gets for quote unquote free when they buy the new hardware same with all the free educational and training materials Apple is providing online at retail Apple stores today at Apple and everyone can code especially our enormous undertakings financed by Hardware profit hell right now Apple is even using hardware profits to give away a free year of TV plus service make all the morning show jokes you must it also means Apple gets to avoid some of the more distasteful and downright dastardly practices that other vendors choose to perpetrate things like harvesting our data to feed massive advertising engines making up low margins by taking money to load bloatware from companies who want to be on our devices and even even installing malware on their own customers like certificates and rootkits just so they can pretend to cost you less upfront and that's just pcs Apple basically owns the tablet a SmartWatch markets right now so it's fairly pointless to make comparisons there even though they've been pushing down pricing on the $329 iPad and $199 Apple watch 3-4 phones it's instructive to look at the resale market to see how long I phones typically last and how well they hold their value over time a flawless entry-level 64 gigabyte 10 s will get you over $500 10 s max over $600 from a popular trading company more if you sell it yourself same servers 128 gigabyte note 9 which is same era higher capacity doesn't quite get you $350 128 gigabyte Galaxy S 10 which is 6 months newer and higher capacity won't even get you 450 128 gigabyte pixel 3 same year a higher capacity gets you 365 pixel 3xl weirdly just under that at 361 and that's even while the map on upfront costs is changing the iPhone 11 launch price $6.99 is less expensive than Google's pixel for at $7.99 or Samsung's Galaxy S 10 e at 749 were at launch for example sure you can find even cheaper phones but they typically don't last as long or get software updates for as long a police update 'add every iPhone going back to 2015 with the iPhone 6s which means whether you hold on to your iPhone for three or four years hand it down to somebody else or sell it you can often end up spending less than you would if you went with a cheaper phone upfront but you had to replace sooner or more often or couldn't get anywhere nearly the resale kickback on next we get to the Bill of Materials part my friends have added great features like oh le D displays faster processors and thin bezels but competing products have many of the same features which is sort of like saying competing cars all have four wheels true but not very insightful take that OLED display Apple introduced it in 2017 which was not first to market by any means but they not only did unprecedented mitigations and color management they folded it underneath itself to get rid of the bottom bezel an expensive process other vendors with huge chins on their phones weren't willing or able to match until far more recently as to those faster processors Apple has been making increasingly custom chip sets since 2010 they introduced a neural engine with that OLED display back in 2017 they're almost universally acclaimed as the best damn chipsets in the business and they're not buying them off the shelf they're investing in the research and development to design them themselves even though Sony camera modules the video claims Apple uses just like everyone else in 2017 Apple introduced a true depth camera on the front of the iPhone for face ID something only Google has been able to match and it took them two extra years to do it and on the back well both Apple and Google have shown not all usage of commodity camera modules creates images that are equal in Apple's case a lot of the imaging actually comes from those custom chipsets including that neural engine block that's now fed into the custom signal processor the video then compares the Samsung Galaxy S tens build materials to try and make I don't know apples look high I guess the numbers appear to come from tech insights estimates estimates which really don't account for Samsung being part of a conglomerate that may get more favorable pricing than Apple from Samsung but also for the amount of customization both Apple and Samsung require from those alleged commodity parts or of course any associated R&D or human costs apple also invents many of the machines used to make their unibody and chamfered edges and polished and matte finishes and the list literally goes on and on all this to say it makes most super estimates seem kind of laughable but even then the video doesn't follow through and do the math and point out that even those superficial estimates Samsung's bomb ends up being at 42% and apples about 44% yeah all that for 2% and I'll just quickly point out here that that markup Apple's margins are the same now sometimes lower than their historic high at the end of the Steve Jobs era just for anyone who's fallen for the silly narrative that Tim Cook's Apple is where all the drive for profits comes from then finally we get to the sheep part because of course we get to the Sheep part think of Apple is a luxury brand as with Gucci or Hermes customers pay more because the logo is a status symbol even though the entire premise as I've shown is far more complex than what the video addresses they fall back on the trope of Apple customers loving the logos so much they're willing to put up with any markup then you do earn the customer loyalty love is blind but that feels awfully patronizing in glib as a way to describe a billion device big customer base I'm sure some people buy Apple because they in whole or in part see it as a status symbol but maybe just maybe they've also experienced a value that was to them greater than the cost a MacBook or iPhone or iPad that was more approachable to use came with more considerate software had easier to access services and lasted longer than anything else they tried Apple does offer cheaper models like the iPhone 11 for the 11 inch iPad but those aren't always the models customers choose that the brand loyalty and the c-word yes customer sat wasn't gifted or tricked but was earned person by person product by product year by year that instead of sheep the customers are Shepherds some with very keen eyes for the value of their flock but this strategy might not work forever competition with less expensive Android phones has got steeper and that's put the iPhones market share at risk okay Doomer that's both true and a rehash of the same argument that has been used against Apple in the PC world for years for decades if Apple can't sell more iPhones it might have to sell fewer iPhones for more money which sure or maybe just maybe after building up the iPhone to a nearly billion strong platform use it as a platform to launch other products like the Apple watch air pods Apple music apple arcade and more just spitballing here really but Mohan pointed out the Apple has a disadvantage compared to true luxury brands a luxury product is like a Rolex right and you'd keep it for a lifetime we can keep a smartphone for a lifetime so premium perhaps not luxury when people pay tens of thousands of dollars for airplane cabin seats six star hotel rooms drink services and clothing they wear only once and just none of that applies to Rolexes or a luxury or Apple or premium and I just don't get any of this anymore maybe I'll thanks notion and thanks all of you sincerely for supporting the show so why are Apple products so expensive because they only make those types of products ones that for many people provide a lasting value greater than the expense the types of products that when other companies make them part four-part tend to cost around exactly the same price and don't always provide that same lasting value could Apple charge less I mean not zero margin where companies catered exclusively to those for whom lowest price is the only feature that matters and then suffer is zero loyalty when another company subsidized by a search engine ancillary business or entire nation-state undercuts them by even more and inevitably end up failed and forgotten brands licensed by Walmart like many of the consumer tech companies from just decades ago but no seriously just less expensive enough to make their products more attainable by those who want to attain them I'd argue with the $329 iPad 7 $109 Apple watch 3 and even the $609 iPhone 11 Apple has begun doing just that and I very much hope they've cracked the secret formula that will let them continue pushing both higher value and lower prices at least that's what I think I love to know what you think so hit like if you do share if you care subscribe if you haven't already but bust that Bell gizmo
