__ ] revenge let's go after our heroics of yesterday we expected a raid overnight but no balls they didn't so we have a no balls vigil the importance of having a cop who's available and knowing how to pilot it is so crucial in this day and age you need to be flying in the sky right but also you're gonna be dying right we flew around the biomes to find another mini copter and decided to go do an oil rig run our base is literally on the coast of large oil rig sits our primary monument which is why you'll see us farming it a lot it gets repetitive so usually I wait until I notice I'm taking it and I go and Connor it like you saw in my last video this time I clear the scientist land and appeared as if I have it under control I'll put y'all on the heli all there's this grab heli flying to you

our base a few days after wipe we found ourselves all alone we had a massive base a lot of resources but a majority of our team members already bailed on a server like this with other clans active all we could do was wait for a big online raid now let me give you a saucer we couldn't raid anyone and nobody would rate us we were a prisoner in our own base despite how we might look we had to play like we were a duo there was a huge rate going on not too far away and we went to see if we can do something oh my god now record oh my god it's already over dude we were already tilted are you shooting at them we weren't in the right mindset we weren't working together and I was being a little [ __ ] keep going I'm talking to the guy who's getting ready right now he says there's three of

of the mini copter you ran somewhere you literally did not tell me where you were going it's like there's no synergy you know like teamwork I was playing like we had more than two people flanking around when I should have just grouped up the correct play was to listen to Lipari and fly up to the rate base because I didn't we both died I was also being too negative in the beginning and I was too tunnel-visioned although we were both tilted from being all alone on a Saturday there's no excuse this is rust stuff like this happens all the time so we fix our mistakes and we go again just put
