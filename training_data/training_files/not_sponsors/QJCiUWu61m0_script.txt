you i am deadly and i'm going to be doing another sex ad video to do popular demand you all really seem to love the sex ed series and a lot of people end up asking me questions in the comments so i figured it would be a cool idea to answer some of your questions in a video so i asked my followers on instagram to ask me questions related to sex ed for me to answer so i hope you enjoy this video get yourself a new toy or a partner or a friend whatever so the first question is where is the g-spot and how to finger the g-spot so the g-spot is approximately two inches inside the vagina it's on the top side of the vaginal wall so the best way to reach the g-spot would be to have palm up towards the belly of the person and to use almost like a gum here motion to come here kind of like that sorry that tends to be the best way to reach the g spot you know you're around the area of the mysterious g-spot because it kind of has more of a rougher texture than the rest of the vaginal walls which tend to be quite smooth the next question is is it weird to have a food fetish i'm sure many people would probably think that is something that's weird but it is actually one of the more common fetishes if not the most common fetish so it's pretty wide spread it's not that weird to a lot of people so it really just depends on the person some people think some things are super weird some people are totally used to it and think it's completely normal so is it true that ninety percent of the time women fake their orgasm during intercourse now i did do a little bit of researching for this one because there isn't a lot of research out there on the topic of faking orgasms but of the study that i did find they reported that of the 71 sexually active heterosexual women who answered their survey 25 of them said that they faked orgasms 90 of the time so 71 isn't exactly it's a pretty small sample size that was surveyed so it may not necessarily be representative of the average female population but the results of this survey nonetheless would indicate that it's only a minority of women who make orgasms up to 90 of the time which is still quite a large number but yeah i would have to say a lot more research would have to be done on that to give a conclusive answer the next question that i have is how long should sex last now sex can last however long you want it to of course there's no definitive answer of how long it should last for everyone it depends on you and whoever you're with but usually sex can last anywhere from like five to twenty minutes but it can also be much shorter than that or much longer than that next how does the morning after bill white the morning after bill which is also sometimes more commonly referred to as plan b contains hormones which delay the release of the egg from the ovaries so this essentially prevents ovulation so if the egg isn't there to be fertilized then pregnancy can occur now of course this is most effective when taken around 72 hours of the time of integral so it's not going to be very effective if it's taken outside of those 72 hours but yeah what is the most common std in the world now this can vary a bit depending on what country you're from but world wide the most common sdis include chlamydia herpes hpv and gonorrhea can oral sex give you any sexual diseases yes all of the stis that i just mentioned can be transmitted through oral sex but they are more likely to be transmitted through vaginal sex and anal sex the next question is what is the average penis size now again this can vary a little bit depending on what country you're from but it tends to vary from around five to six inches but it can be a little more depending away from or a little bit less depending away from the next question is is masturbating every day wrong or unhealthy nope that is completely normal the next question is without a doubt the most commonly asked question in that is of course does size matter i went a bit more into detail on this one in my debunking sex myths video so if you would like a long answer go and watch that one but the short answer is that it really just depends on who you ask some people might say that they prefer a bigger sized penis because it feels better whilst others don't really mind and a lot of people might say that they prefer a lot of penises for solely aesthetic reasons or just for the way it looks not necessarily how it feels but i think most importantly as i outlined in my debunking myths sex ed video the majority of people tend to be satisfied with whatever size their partner may have do you guys get a uti if they don't be after sex or is that just a unfortunate exclusive for the girls so udi is short for urinary tract infection and it is way more common in women than it is men and this is because for people with vaginas they have a much shorter urethra than people who have a penis and so the bacteria has a much shorter distance to travel in those with the vagina so that leads to a uti so that's why a lot of women in their lifetime get utis it's actually pretty common and there is some research that suggests that being after sex can help to flush out bacteria from the urethra but this is by no means a 100 preventative measure against utis what's the best kind of birth control to take i've heard so many answers the reason why you've heard so many answers is because the answer is totally dependent on the individual because what works for one person might not be the best for others mostly due to the side effects that may occur so some people get really wacky side effects like pimples and mood swings even depression or cramping or other sorts of things so something that works great for someone might not be so great for others it's really just a matter of finding what works for you i want to know about protection from stds in lesbian sex so having a physical barrier between you and the person you're having sex with is really the only way to protect yourself against stds so in any forms of penetrative sex including the use of sex toys uh condoms are the best way to protect against stds and in the case of connolingus or oral sax you can use a dental dam which is just like a sheet a thin sheet of latex which you would place over the top of someone's vulva or anus for oral sex the next question is is tight foreskin bad i think that foreskin is normal when you're young but if this persists into adolescence or adulthood it can be bad if it is preventing you from easily or painlessly retracting or pulling back the foreskin this is known as phimosis and it can cause discomfort during urination or sex and other things so if it is something that is causing you discomfort then of course the best thing to do is to talk to your doctor about it do girls like anal or are they just agreeing to make their boyfriends happy lots of people of all genders enjoy anal sex this is another thing which is completely dependent on the person some people love it some people hate it some people never want to do it some people love to do it really just depends on the individual is it seen as weird to own a fleshlight if you don't know a flashlight is i think it's actually the most popular male sex toy and sex toys can be seen as quite a taboo a lot of people tend to think it's weird and things like that but sex and masturbation are completely normal most people have sex or masturbate at least once in their lifetime so as long as you're enjoying yourself and you aren't hurting anyone i wouldn't worry too much about what other people think is weird do women reach full orgasm with just penetration most actually gone from penetration alone they need some kind of clitoral stimulation as well i went a little more into detail on this one in my first sex head video so go and watch that if you haven't already how to have anal sex well the anus does not sufficiently self lubricate like the vagina can during arousal so the use of lube is highly recommended if you are ever wanting to have anal sex the next question is how do i deal with premature ejaculation sex is largely a mental thing i don't think people realize how much your head and your thoughts during sex can actually impact your sexual performance for example if you're nervous or worried about how you're going to perform this could lead to premature ejaculation or even delayed ejaculation or no orgasm at all because you're so worried about how you're gonna perform it actually ends up affecting your performance so it's always good to make sure you're feeling super comfortable in your own body in this situation feeling comfortable with your partner and that can really help out in that department otherwise a lot of people also like to use things such as numbing creams or numbing sprays or sometimes even just wearing a condom to help desensitize the area a little bit so that they can last longer in bed that was fun i hope you
