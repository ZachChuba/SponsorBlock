hi there the majority of my work is traditional our I like doing things I like working with acrylic paint oil paint I've not done much graphic I have taken some courses in school so I know how to do it but the main reason I haven't done it is because I haven't had a tablet over the holidays though I decided to invest in one I thought learning how to use it doing a bit review or and sharing with you guys some first projects those may be asking you guidance personnel would be a good introduction video do this as well as it out after that it's about $10 a month ish so here we are with this thing you have seen my intro that's actually my first project I've done on it and my only project really this is the stylus app in that the tablet came it came in the case with extra tips off the top turns into a stand there are lots of different tablet brands out there I went with XP pin one mainly because of money there are the brands like Wacom who have the name and notoriety I've not used them myself because I've just need this one this whole set with the stand it came with a glove a cloth an extra pin and then a 22 inch monitor with quick keys on the side I got it direct from XP 10 because they were doing a Christmas sale of sorts and I got it for 300 with extra bits for free and we should turn it on just charge it again again but also this is really big so you have to make sure you have the work space for it they do have smaller ones obviously that I was gonna get one I was like I might as well go big so I was like I'm gonna go for it this does need a computer to plug into we're gonna plug this into a Mac this is an HDMI cable and we have a USB attachment start out here is my January opening picture I did make this in Photoshop and we are going to be working in Photoshop today again illustrator is good for projects that are more corporate or need to meet specifications and graphic design I'm a painter and you can use programs like psy or Photoshop to paint digitally this again was my first project I tried him this and I'm not having much time to use it since and today I'm more or less showing what it's like to use a graphic tablet the benefits as well as doing a little art project with you guys so let's go over some with a cool bit for one thing depending on the type of brush you use you can turn on the brush sensitivity on your stylus let's go with blue we press down lightly we'll start to draw a circle but if we add more pressure the color comes through darker this is really helpful for achieving a more natural feel to drawing on the tablet now let's start the main project and you guessed it we're drawing the cat again I do love kitty carrot Oh using a small brush I'm going to do a light sketch do the old circle ball curved line trick to place the eyes I'm just keeping them very basic here is that curled around making it very sketchy then add another layer on top go over the main lines get rid of the sketchy layer so we're going to make a layer underneath the sketch now color it all in outside the lines I know it hurt it's just how I'm doing it today then we go back and race up to the outline [Music] now I'm adding another top coat this one is going on top of the sketch layer on this one I'm adding some hair texture on the edges to help smooth the belt make it look a bit more natural fill in those gaps fix the shadows on the face I did this simpler drawing today but I'm still new to this and I'd rather do a small project than take on something too large right now and get a little bit discouraged now we're gonna add a layer underneath everything switch to a cloud brush to add some purple and green tones and lighter blue tones in the background some grass and then I'm going to fine-tune it so I'm going to add saturation make some color changes at a paper texture finish up anything I think that needs to be finished and here's the end results I'll even sign this one I'm really bad about signing and now another thing the tablet is good for is practicing how to draw like with this one you can start with a character face draw a circle add a chin and a nose at the base of the circle line up the eyes add some toads the eyes just to play about I don't care you can go back and forth practicing drawing different expressions or hairstyles character design is something that I do really want to get better at so I'm really happy to have this tool and overall I'm really excited to see what I can learn cuz I know I'm not perfect now but hopefully I'll get better just you know gotta keep at it [Music] thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed the video I enjoyed it I also have my golden kinda giveaway with my new pen so if you'd like a chance to win a pen please leave a nice comment down below again thank you discussion for sponsoring currently deciding what color League through we've got blue we've got red green impact -
