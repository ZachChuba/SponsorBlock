this week raga myself are locked to bank chunks as you can see on the map right here I've highlighted all the chunks on the map that have banks all actions must be performed inside these highlighted areas any bank across the whole of runescape except for a few the first of these are dark maya seeing as the map hasn't been updated it has nothing on there at the moment and we didn't want to get confused with the chunks the second one is over in prifddinas again hasn't been updated and we didn't want to get confused with the chunks and the last rule is that we cannot use dungeons within the chunks or any underground banks either just so we don't spend all our time in a dungeon all tools are provided we have two hours to come up with the best PK setup to kill the other think you boy are you kidding me these and keys of super G's do we have a sponsored a half today it is Ray Khan and this is actually the little charging port for your earbuds if we open this up we have two magnetic buds in here and with just one charge in that captured you get six hours of playtime and 24 hours of battery life these little beauties come up half the price as the top earbuds right now at the market and they sound just as good they're great for working at home great for going on a run or a walk and you just want to take your music with you they're awesome lightweight and really easy to fit in your ears what I hate about most earbuds like this are they just do not fit my ears but rake on send you out several molds some one will fit your ear perfectly and I've found a perfect fit here these are the everyday e25 and they sound awesome it paired with my phone straight away and they just feel so amazing use the link down in the description or the one on screen right now and he'd get yourself 50% off at checkout low everybody feels like a bit of deja vu I've been here the start of a challenge pretty recently as well but at two hours bank squares only you guys saw the sort of things we mean of where we can go as you can see we've got a bank right here so this is where I'm going to be starting and of course is to pick the flax because I want the flax to make an MSB so let's start the timer there and of course we are allowed to run outside of the chunks but we're not allowed to make any actions when we go out outside of these chunks so I'm actually leaving this chunk and going into the next one over here which is going to be this one so I can get myself a magic log there we go not too long at all which is nice and we're gonna make the short boat there and then we are going to tele and we're gonna get ourselves over to the Nome stronghold so that I can turn this into a bowstring we go made that into a bow string and we have an MSB two and a half minutes in not bad at all all right let's get ourselves over to Adi because we need to start working over there okay so we are using the legends guild bank so we're able to use this chunk going to get myself some iron and coal together we're gonna be making some steel arrowheads just so we can actually get ourselves you know some arrows together because we really need that so we can actually use the MSB soon as we got that we're gonna be looking great that is one in the tree of iron I think that's all I'm gonna do and then I'm just gonna grab myself two in the trees of coal and that way we'll have enough loads and loads of arrows and maybe even make up you know some plate legs or some plate body or something like that if worst comes to worst here we go guys starting next to the magic tree next to this bank over here this is pretty much the bank chunk only PvP challenge you've been only be in chunks where there are banks I'm sorry next to this magic tree because we're gonna go for that magic short bow it's a very very very quick weapon to get might be the final fight weapon since we can't use shops or anything can't really Smith anything better plus I will want to kill some monsters throughout this PvP challenge so either way I'm gonna get one whether I use it in the final fight or not so ya can't use shops I have a knife from the bank we can't get tools from the bank and all the teleports that I think I'm gonna need so without further ado let's start that timer where did I put the V clock there it is let's start that timer start chopping the tree all we need is one coins are gonna be pretty useless in this PvP challenge or actually extremely useless so once we get this log I'm gonna pick some flax I think there's some over here somewhere because like this tree is actually on the cutoff line it's pretty crazy but we definitely can chop this tree we just picked up the flax right by the bank and all these spinning wheels or at least this one specifically is definitely allowed it is in the same square super super hype about that although there actually are spinning wheels everywhere by banks but let's spin this real quick and make that's a lot of things you could craft on a spinning wheel damn make a short bow and boom we're like a minute in ten seconds in and we have that short bow now next to my plan I want to get some gold ore so we're gonna pick pockets um I guess at this gnome woman right here get gold ore because that is how we are going to make some jewelry later on in the episode but I want to get it right now since we're starting in the tree gnome village or tree no I'm strong cold now I sound like an idiot I wanted three goals or and you guys will see why'd later I think this is the fastest way to get gold ore unfortunately it's it's actually taking much longer than I thought the problem is is that I don't think there's any way to mind goals or truthfully so we can't go underground so right up north there's that mine that's right by a bank and I can't use that one sec nicly because underground I can't use the one in twos our goals were right next to a bank because it's underground we can only do the map surfaces only if you see the the bank we actually can't go up the stairs but not down the stairs put it that way so this is taking longer than expected if it takes another minute or so I'll probably just carry on and I could just swing back if it becomes an issue okay this is gonna be the last coal that we need and we gonna fire over to falador because there is a furnace within the within the bank area so let's fire on over there to pour phalli beautiful right let's grab out our iron and our coal start making some steel bars there we go that is 27 bars made so i think i'm gonna go ahead and kill a few chickens now to get our feathers together and we're gonna have to go over to the island of it etc i think is what it's called but I'm not sure but yeah we need to head on over there awesome we've got the chickens right here just outside the front and yeah we're using the the bank here as our as I sort of like home I don't know what to call it sort like a a lodestone almost the back I'll then roosters [ __ ] me does the rooster drop more does a rooster drop more feathers let's have a look I never even knew roosters were in the game that they drop the same amount of somehow fly kick too [ __ ] rooster on top of the stall and ya never knew that was a thing did not honestly learning so much about the game I think it probably is a glitch but maybe the rooster was on top of the stall I don't know okay 415 feathers that should be absolutely perfect I don't have my I don't I don't think you can even cut these I think it goes towards you like miscellany a favor or something so we're gonna go cut some normal trees probably just do that I don't even know we're gonna do the grand exchange we've got this whole square the bank obviously here and trees all around us there we go the gold or finally right what's the fastest way to get shafts I know it depends on what like you cut I might just cut oaks I know there's use here and stuff but I don't think I need too much I want like 90 ish arrows for the fight if if I happen to go MSB which is still looking like I might that was actually super quick we have 420 420 blaze it might make a bit more though because if I can make some nice cheap arrows we're not cheap because price isn't really a factor here it's more can I make it really quick again we can't you shop so we can't just go buy arrows so it's gonna be interesting this episode bit of a different take I'm gonna be making arrows have I ever done this in a PvP challenge I really don't know but either way pretty cool right let's teleport to the heart of Kuran now there's a chicken pen that is right here accessible from this Bank right here on the mini-map which is quite nice really easy to get to I'm not sure there's a better one this but it's not like this one's far we have to kick we can't we don't have any items that we can't use these actually it's probably better so the kick anyway cuz we're level like - what am I even talking about talking absolute [ __ ] right now yet let's kick some chickens actually sounds really really horrible I mean who the [ __ ] would ever kick a chicken leave its a grandpa Rourke he's he's [ __ ] kicking chickens [ __ ] look at him showing his knees out and stuff what a [ __ ] sight horrible man what is wrong with you right we have over 400 feathers that has to be enough it has to be it has to be it has to be let's pick up this last batch you didn't drop any feathers are you kidding me anyways we can't do this really Oh nope it's an automatic function here I am thinking I'm making darts over here so let's make these all into headless arrows now the next thing I'm going to do is mine my balls off right now so we are gonna go to fossil island there's lots of coal lots of iron for some steel arrows there is also a Dior and of course the coal I just mentioned for some a t-bars so that's gonna be the next move guys lots of mining because I think a DS gonna be the best equipment I did a lot of research on blasts fine wares blast mine nope too far too far right over here and unfortunately this guy I mean we can't use shops anyway but there's really no way to get dynamite that's what I'm trying to get at least no way quick we only have two hours on the clock so it looks like Adam and I or I can't mind room but there's honestly no rune rocks to mine either I don't think at least there is I missed it but we both camp behind route anyway so I think addy is going to be the move fossil Island let's head there through the dig site and take the boat over and start mine okay there we go very very nice we're gonna tele to nightmare zone now and we're gonna use the anvil over in your Neil because it's right by a bank and that way we'll be able to just grab him out do it really quickly make the arrow tips and then we'll have some steel arrows gonna have 400 steel arrows which should be really nice and then we can actually start killing stuff and getting some gear together okay I just gonna Fletch all of these and then yeah grab the steel bars out right head for Saros arrow tips even headless arrows arrow tips make all of these we're gonna have four hundred and five I think which we have enough headless arrows for and then let's go and kill some elves okay here we go put those on so annoying it's not like the you know darts we can just do it over and over again so annoying okay that took a bit of time about 40 minutes but we do have arrows now and also I mean I could use these in the final fight I don't think I'm it's gonna be super easy to upgrade the arrows can we attack please there we go and I'm gonna try in safe spot they obviously have the to square distance yeah that's not what we want it to see can you not fire through these okay I'm gonna have to find a safe spot somewhere here but let's do this actually there's notes around here somewhere isn't there I think it's upstairs yeah just upstairs I'm pretty sure there's an altar so we could be fine actually shucks a speck in and obviously we're gonna be killing these for their green D hide bodies and green dehydrates hopefully we can get one of those that would be really really nice hopefully we get both they do drop an assortment of other things sharks for example but nothing too crazy when I do work out once I know there's an altar I'm gonna be flicking or using rigor as well just don't want to go crazy right now before I know first drop is gonna be a crystal teleport cedar useful when I'm grinding but not right now now I think the altar it's just upstairs yes beautiful okay cool so it's gonna be rigor it's gonna be protect we're gonna be fine no food needed it's really really nice and yeah just gonna be going for these drops here okay this is gonna be my last kill for now if I don't get the green D hide bodies or legs then I'm gonna come back and try and get them at the end because I've got so much you need to do I still need to get food together I also need to get my armor together so this is sort of like a luxury thing if I can get the green dehydrate but I need to sort of like future-proof myself in case I don't so yeah this is gonna be the last kill here and we will see what we get come on green D hi Bonnie would be amazing just haven't checked in with you guys for a bit so I'm just finding lots and lots of coal first I'm gonna need like a hundred and thirty plus coal that might be a little more than needed but I don't want to have to come back 30 minutes only spend we have an hour and a half left I think I plenty of time to do everything I wanted you but you know the trek back here is you know I'm not gonna want to do it if I don't have to so I'm gonna mine everything enough for the steel arrows the Adi arrows and all the ADI equipment I need which is the full helm the chain body and the legs of course chain body because it gives no negative range attack and it still will be pretty high with the magic short bow because this gives plus 69 here we go 125 Cola want to say that should enough now we're gonna mine I want to say like 15 iron ore roughly about that and then I'm gonna mine the ADI that's up here you only mine these three addy I said before about how you can't mine drew and I'm sure some of you are eyeing up that rune I ordered the line actually runs like roughly right here where my mouse is so I actually won't be able to mine that room night or not that I had the level for it but even if I did it actually would not be allowed all right guys we have 15 a Dior and 16 iron ore in the bank the iron is actually part of other hour and a half in the bank but I wrote it down so yeah let's head to varrock really quickly and Smith these up I'm quite silly we actually have to go to Alec Reed first that make the bars only wasted like 30 seconds there so let's make the bars and then after I make all my armor and stuff and all the arrows I'm actually gonna fish my food because the plan I have after that is very orangey based and with fishing and cooking sharks I mean I guess there is RNG if you're really really pressured for time but otherwise it takes like 15 16 17 minutes ish and and that's all so yeah I've to do this we are going to fish all of our sharks okay so for the final gear in the fight let's myth the anvil and we want plate legs we want a chain body we want a full helm and then the rest of the ADI bars are all gonna go towards arrow tips which is 15 each so we'll have 90 I think is what I calculated by the end of this so yeah and then we're gonna make all those steel bars into steel arrows as well and then we're gonna fish those sharks that's right I totally forgot I mind that extra a D or you guys weren't there when I decided to actually go ahead and do it so we're gonna make these into the arrows and these will be the arrows for the final fight and these steel arrows were actually be used to kill hobgoblins I mean I don't know if I'll have a lot of time for this plan but if I make jewelry which is where I got the gold or as well I'll needs to enchant it and I the only way I can find to get cosmics by a bank that is without using shops is killing hobgoblins it's a one at a 128 drop they drop two of them it seems brutal to be honest I don't think it'll happen but I think I'll have a lot of time left over after officially sharks so let's go fish those sharks there we go come on Lawrence no thank you on the bright side still have like 300 arrows so we're pretty good there right I need to go to fossil Island now ok so as you can see we've got a bank on our left a bank on our right and just dying in the middle of both of them we have some a Dior here which is very very nice gonna need to get myself enough together I don't know what to do in terms of what to get I might just get plate legs and risk it risk getting the body from the elves the body's more common than the legs so I'm gonna risk it we're gonna make adamant legs and hope we get the green D high body later on it's the way I have to play this I can't just keep trying to kill them until I get one or the other I need to get everything else ready so yeah I'm gonna make a deep plate legs and a D kite shield and an a/d full helm yes that's what I'll do [ __ ] so we need three six eight add yours we need and then we need to grab ourselves I sort of want to make Adi arrows as well so you know what I do I'm gonna get like 12 out of yours we'll make 50 plus arrows as well and that should be enough for the fight hope I'm so [ __ ] dumb I'm trying to make a kite shield when I don't even have when I'm using an MSB so no we're not we don't need three bars for the kite shield that saves us a little bit okay so I'm just gonna make 9 9 addi bars is what I'm gonna make 3 for the plate legs 2 for the full helm and then the rest of 4 rest will go into arrows giving us 60 60 addi arrow should be enough for the fight if we pick it up as well so yeah just this last a Dior and then we'll grab all of this coal turn it into the bars and then we can grab our fish we're gonna go shark we got the harpoon for the shark as a tool so we can we can fish the Sharks over in her sidious and then the rest of the time is just gonna be trying to get that green D hide body it's red it's less rare than the legs and also if I was making a plate body I'd need 5 more bars and I don't really want to bother with that so we got a hope we've got a hope but we should have probably half an hour I think maybe a little bit less to to get ourselves a green D hide body and I've already killed quite a few you know we've already killed 23 elf warriors flash archers so you know we're on our way we're on our way to that Casey where we should get the green D hi body there we go that is all the coal we need oh my god this is gonna be tight I want I want at least 20 minutes to kill as many elves as possible so we'll see we'll see but let's Bank all of this we're gonna have to we've got to make arrow tips as well why I'm so just took about 16 minutes ish to fish all that fish I guess a bit longer to walk here as well even if I burn a fish or not I have to fish like what are more actually one or two more if I burn any to fill up the harpoon slot that's in my inventory because I can't bear hand the shark so probably will spend a few more minutes here yep there it is probably will spend a few more minutes here and then we're gonna kill the hobgoblins because it's much harder to get the cosmic rooms that it is to get the gems because I can just either mind them I actually plan on mining them because I didn't mind the diamond and I know I'll get lots of sapphires in the process so it's much easier to get the gems and it is the cosmic rune so we're gonna try to go for the cosmic runes and the earth rooms needed to you enchant and I guess water as well for the jewelry I got three gold ore because I want to recoils and one Phoenix necklace because I would rather power every but I don't think I'd get a ball of wool anywhere four sharks burnt so it's probably fish like five more just in case and then send that whole cosmic room plan and see if it pans out we need two drops I guess at that rate I could just make it extra Phoenix necklace because it drops it in groups two and we are good we only needed four and that's five cooks so we are now going to pop a crafting Cape teleport and run right on over to those hop gobs so actually I just realized I mean I do have the crafting Cape and we are allowed to use any Telly's we want so for example I could have gotten right in that's nice about crafting I could have gotten right in the guild but I know link can't do this so that's why I don't want a mine here I didn't really make that clear but that was my thought process from the beginning let me actually get my harem chick love's out and a glory because that's where I would be heading to if I get super lucky with these drops we're gonna go to Draenor to kill those wizards for the earth and water runes and then carranza to get the gems and of course they're in Charlotte we could also create the whole entire necklace or ring so that's the plan one out of 180 two for these cosmic runes piss it's got [ __ ] charcoal no okay we're gonna go to falador we're going to falador cow way overboard there we only I thought we're making 400 again I'm stressing over pretty much nothing to be honest we only need to make 60 so let's go and kill the chickens they're here in the courtyard and then we'll have enough feathers beautiful 60 feathers we got more than enough arrow shafts let's start making these again just remembered that it charges money and I did get a bit of money from the elves but I don't know exactly how much the the shadow village thing charges so I'm not going to bother with it just because I don't want to pay to use the furnace or get there and be like oh it doesn't work so we're just gonna do it here okay so let's make four arrow tips here or 60 even there we go 45 and 60 and then we'll make the full helm and we'll make the lake's Royal St that make these into headless arrows and then put those on there and we have ourselves 60 addi arrows for the fight very very happy about we have an eclectic in playing and it is within the area the banks just here okay are we gonna catch it now apparently not come on a lot of time for this I don't have time for this oh I [ __ ] oh you can run down there no you can't [ __ ] it whatever I hate you right 38 minutes left I really really really want to have 20 minutes at the elves I think we got 20 minutes to get 27 shark I think we should be okay yeah we should be fine here okay 23 minutes left we have 27 sharks I'm gonna bank them here and then I'm gonna get one more and I'm gonna go to the his sidious range what I am gonna do is if I get one really quickly I'll go for two sharks but if it takes a bit of time then we do that you got to super quick so I'm gonna do a third we're gonna do a third and then we're off to the Hasidic also I don't know if the sand crab attacking me is making me like tick faster like you know how people like to tick fish I don't know if this does anything I'm not 100 cents sure but it disappeared after a few minutes on the last time if I had it and it seemed like I was fishing quicker with it but I don't know let me know comment section is this doing anything so with 11 minutes and 39 seconds we are let's see we are 12 kills over the drop rate right now and still no cosmic rune it quite sucks the problem is now even if I get it I'm a little nervous that I won't have enough time to do what I wanted to you and that's if I got it right now I did get a sapphire luckily but it wasn't sapphires that I was necessarily worried about it was the diamond and getting the earth and water runes from another monsters so oh there's water rooms there how many is that that's you I need I need how much oh [ __ ] that actually is enough Wow okay let's let's just get some cause of explai it some cosmic runes so in a really desperate attempt to kill the hobgoblins really really quickly I wasn't really picking up my hours - well and we have three minutes left and I am out of arrows so I I'm angry guys we got you know I guess let's just start kicking I mean it's not like like if even if I got cosmic runes right now I don't think I could even make it in time I need to go to the bank get the mold which is a tool by the way it's actually spawn in there as well so we're not even mattered but um I need a chisel I need to go to the furnace for my gold award because I didn't do it before because I figured I would have been in charlo anyway and still make the whole thing I need to get all that stuff together in two minutes and that's if I got it right now like I'm getting all these nature rune drops which these are half the rarity I got five drops of this I got two lawyerin drops also half the rear one a 64 3 chaos rune drops there 164 it's just like guys it fortunately at this point it's beat so this is gonna be us in the final fight with a full inventory of sharks I tried guys I tried it led us down let's see we have 186 Hobgoblin kills this will be 187 and then I'm gonna call it because like I said guys even if this drops it there's no way I'm making all of this in time uh looks like a sand crab but this is the gear guys full of entire sharks we have a hundred and five addi arrows I will see you in the fight that's what we need that's what we need please give it to me first kill no oh no oh no the risk hasn't come off so far if anything it's it's really not looking great Oh No how the green D hard legs and we've got an E legs in that slot and I didn't make the body but if anything it's gonna make me a little bit more accurate for the last ten minutes maybe we can do it we're still gonna get probably another ten kills or so these are going really really quickly ah I'm just feeling myself now but it would have been ludicrous to have made a plate body when the d hide bodies is more common [ __ ] come on give me the DI body as well please a minute left guys I'm not gonna lie I'm feeling a bit hard done by we've killed like 50 plus of these and the drop rate is like one in 30 ish and we still haven't got the kill so although drop even we might get one more killing I'm not even gonna run to the altar I'm just gonna get ready for this kill 45 seconds come on go go go go go go spawn spawn we're not going to get you I thought was gonna be way quicker ah 36 seconds let's see what we get here guys can we get the key why are we gonna hit hard we don't have any spec left 30 seconds I don't know what I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna probably wear the ADI plate legs not gonna lie guys but I'm gonna have a look at the defensive bonuses and stuff like that 15 seconds it's not going to happen is it I've hit bunch of [ __ ] zeros what the [ __ ] that was like the worst kill I've done ever right yeah that's not gonna happen is it six five four three oh my god it's so close as well fine hit those zeros let's see what we got obviously I won't be counting this drop but everyone wants to know imagine I just cut it off there okay wouldn't have got it anyway okay let's go ahead and let's show you what I'm gonna go for fuming fuming [ __ ] it guys I'm going with the green D hardships the defensive bonuses aren't that much different obviously they're slightly higher with the addy plate legs but we do get the 75 range compared to with the addy plate legs it was 60 range and I think just hitting more often is gonna be key to winning this one a little bit worried he's gone with a crossbow and maybe gone with some you know emerald palsy or something like that if you manage to get that together fair play to him bit fuming we would have looked really strong with a green d high body and the a deep plate legs we'd be looking really really great here but orange II didn't come through this time let's see if we can be kids kids thanks only yes how do you feel about I wanna I really like the idea however my plan that I thought I had plenty of time for didn't work out not because I planned wrong but because orangey just did not want to be in water orange II didn't want to be in my favor either so okay okay okay that does make you feel a lot better because the last 30 minutes I was I mean I didn't record most of its a month me but I'm just sitting alone in my room going oh yeah maybe we have the same thing Mike would say I mean I I think I have a pretty solid idea what you might have but let's let's fire in the reveal oh man kokin so you can pick whatever you want right I'm gonna go you know I'm gonna go big cuz I usually go helm first I'm gonna go legs okay oh wow here we go right oh god oh god ooh interesting interesting I have no idea where you got that but I went with adamant plate leagues I have some as well you brought ball I just got but I went with great D heart in the end I think that has defense bonuses like black yak 10 to 15 less than unlike most things guards L by elf warriors and I party - well I'll tell you now this is where my orange he [ __ ] me up we obviously did be the same thing I killed about 60 and it's a 1 in 32 for the body and I made I had to time plan myself so I went and made a deep late legs and was like I'll just get the body later on and then I got the green dehydrates didn't I course I [ __ ] did which are rarer than the body by about 10 or 15 and so I had two leg slots no body slot so I don't have anything in the body stop how did you kill the bee elfs I made my own steel arrows 400 of them why did I the same play but I didn't kill elves why do you still uh fossil island is my mind at all and then I went to Al Qura to Smith it and Barak to actually or to smelt it and operate it is a very similar style stress yeah I steer this is going okay so I guess it's your pick man I'm gonna go body make because you know I don't have anything there let's see do ya [ __ ] i I mean I have a very strong suspicion you probably have the same thing no I my last 25 minutes I spent waiting to get the body and I was like just gonna try to get the body it was a 1 in 32 I was like I've killed 60 yeah that's crucial dude because this chain body cos negative zero rain I know and I I know it does I know it does and oh my god actually I actually feel sorry for you man I I thought mine was was crucial but I think I spent fifty minutes probably tried to get the body just now okay I guess like oh hell right okay okay so yeah weapon kids that's all I've come back same but I think it's quite obvious so where my luck went bad I have this huge play to make Phoenix necklaces and and make ringer recoils yeah and I met hobgoblins for about 40 minutes to get cosmic sand it is 1 in 128 but I'm like ah like I have all these little arrows magic short bow prayer flicking like I'm gonna just rip through these guys 200 kills and I did not get the to drop this drops to at 1 so I was like okay I'll get 1 recoil and 1 Phoenix necklace which feels like 30 percent of your HP so this be shark and a half that I don't have to waste any inventory slots for and it just didn't get it and then we're like 10 minutes were left I'm like even if I got it now there's no way I could piece everything together by now cuz I didn't had to get like earth rude and still and [ __ ] so but Wow you don't have a body there's a dude you know how solid I would have looked with addy plate legs and a green di body I was I was like yeah this is gonna be unreal this is such a good setup and that just didn't happen in the end so yeah Wow more plans fell massive yeah dude that's that's crazy you look astrayed real quick but I'm gonna assume gonna assume you have a D ok he went 205 Wow yeah okay I mean I thought I genuinely thought I had the time so I'm sitting there like like yeah I can kill 100 I mean this is the last saving grace I mean if you [ __ ] up on food but it doesn't sound like you have you know I remember season 1 link when I always had like three foods that's like left open and stuff I I nod to get my food in the middle of the challenges fishing guilds right no actually I really think about that I did snobbish

your arrows cool cool our respective eight I respect it yeah dude this is at the tank it's like it's like you can't hit me you know yeah that's the thing yeah what have been really interesting to see what is better if you had the green D hide bodies and like that would destroy it yeah I I think I think that does it because you get you get decent defensive bonuses from the from the green D hide and then on top of that having the eggs arranged yeah I think that does it all day long gone gone Oh which at the spec now I mean I guess I got 20/20 spec is possible yeah that would be pretty vicious as I said one waste when he spec I mean I said once in one of these challenges of 44 and everyone lost at me I mean the the roasting I would get if I got 20 20 inspect out it's so hard being Team Rocket
