every what's going on is Hecky rise here wanna make the long dark interloper series 1 episode 2 version 2.0 so here we are in the late cabins and this is the late Kevin it's all by itself literally a couple breaths later after the last episode I have not seen any comments from the last video or anything like that so if I ignore any tips or anything that I missed it's like right around the corner here not I'm not like reverse trolling or anything like that I'm literally I just haven't seen him yet okay so we got the bear still out there hanging out I was hoping you'd fallen in and I think I'm gonna go oh I don't know if I wanna go up and around I don't know where these wolves are okay well I and then I know where one is but I don't know where the other one is okay I'm a little I can't go up that way a little nervous honestly cuz I can't I can't go too wide out here otherwise the Bears gonna come after me so I kind of kind of want to peek this corner best I can without attracting the bear I just make sure there's not a wolf coming back okay alright alright where's your partner in crime where's wolf number two I don't know I don't know we're gonna head for these cabins we're gonna leave these we're gonna head over to probably head I don't know where we'll go in the fog know we'll probably go for will probably not hit every place here on this map we'll go for the Carter hydro dam and we'll take the safe route up through the mountains there are all the hills and we'll get over there Luke Carter hydro dam and then we'll head straight over to a coastal and go from there to be a good time cuz I kind of think I'm gonna find a hacksaw if I don't that's fine I could still craft up some tools so much needed tools with just what I have and then I can start chopping down some they [ __ ] in funding hacksaw at least I can get a hatchet I can chop down some saplings and get that bow and arrows started then we can hunt for some larger game it can also know maybe get some get some deers killed by wolves and then draw the Wolves away and come back start a fire and got the harvested deer that's sort of a plan of attack if don't have any weapons but I do need some way to do need some way to cut it open I guess I guess I got probably good for that I can probably get the deer as long as I didn't let them freeze we'll see regardless I need to get myself a improvised knife and a improvised hatchet just thinking out loud sometimes it gets confusing I know alright so you're trying not to miss anything but I always do at least I didn't miss the magnifying glass my gosh that makes up for a lot of past sins I'll tell okay let's get going here I do need to get another drink I'm doing what I did in the last episode run around hydrated take another ser condition it's alright what if they squawking around they're dead good there is a dead guy right here oh that was just a backpack there's that guy next to a be some feathers around here right no feathers really we got some wood as fer what it's like really really dark fir wood alright well let's try this at the whole day ahead of us I love it I love it I think we're gonna make it by the end of the day I think we'll probably be another side of a coastal hopefully by the end of this episode this one it's my goal anyway not gonna rush things though never know what the weather's going to do okay I have plenty of books I don't really need any more books more cloth I'm good on cloth too but if a little storm sets in we can sit in here and do our repair clothes we're not at a point we're so desperate that we have to dedicate calories and waste know somewhat navigatable weathers I don't really like traveling in the fog but I think an interloper I better get over that can't we can't all I can't all be sunshiny days right all right we should be good I didn't check this other one over here did I it's too dark yeah we need to check this other cabin that's right forgot all about it I think I just need to walk I don't need to run that'll just tire me out too fast as can see when I start running goes from like one arrow down on my fatigue to like 3 so I really shouldn't be doing that especially if I've got a long ways to travel if I was just running around here and I had know it's just gonna be staying close by for the night not doing a whole lot probably wouldn't be that big a deal but I do I do want to beat feet and try to make it to the other side of coastal at least and still hit Carter hydro dam all the way do look now they're putting them in every cabin like they were always there right wait oh yeah I accidentally accidentally looted some of the stuff missed that one though uh-huh okay like wait did that leave this Gavin no wait I did tried that's like real clumsy but try to do it in the pitch black but no luck there oh well that wasn't really worth coming back for at all but let's get going again alright so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go up to the to the camp office warm up and then we'll make our way over there so we'll sit there for about an hour or two I'll do some repairing all those couple items and then we'll head out okay dang it I need to stop running it's a habit it's like an internal struggle know Anakin had the dark side I have shift run that's my it's my inner demon oh wow starting to lift like it I like it ice fishing huh no kidding really there's a deer out there I think it's a first deer I've seen I mean that wasn't dead oh okay I know that there is a cave back there but there's rarely anything in there except for firewood and I haven't feel an interloper sokovia just a futile attempt to find something good when and it's kind of sometimes there's oh well I've seen wolves back there so I don't really want to do that it's tight quarters I don't really have a lot of options jook jook around and try to escape so I'm not gonna go back there take my time and my effort would be better spent making it over to the car door hydrogen all right I'm gonna run just because I don't want to take any more of my condition hit that I have to now I'm rationalizing my inner dark side of course if I didn't run that much I wouldn't get the free sprint perk would I though I'm being rewarded for bad behavior it's not the path to to goodness and I don't know never really had to worry about it so much in stalker mode okay so we're inside here should be so looking 41 degrees I'm gonna go and drop some 10 games we don't even carrying all this taking hands we're pointless there we go 11 rocks really don't need that many ok now we're over wait anyway wow we are overweight just from this sort of stuff that charcoal drop that crap and cart carries that junk ten pounds of sticks I kind of want to keep it but at the same time they are everywhere so I'm gonna drop them all I'm gonna grab like ten of them there we go now should be like 3 pounds of sticks yeah ok that's better got a lot of water 12 pounds of water but we're gonna call it carry that around we will get lighter on that as we go Oh probably leave that many books there we go now I'm down to sixty pounds so we're underweight now that's good a lot of these I have tinder plugs I think I got 44 of these that I don't need to make any tinder plugs there we go that's helping it's trying to be a little bit smarter about things here alright so how we doing on wait I want to see some there we only got five feathers well okay so I'm gonna eat a little bit so that can actually work cuz they won't let I don't think they'll it will they let repair for your hungry I don't think they will maybe they will some things can do while you're completely hungered hungry and knackered and all that stuff the other things can't regardless will just go ahead need fine it looked like the fog was lifting so we need to warm up more than anything get rid of this frost but we got frostbite risk she gets dry okay so for those of that haven't seen this before your skin is directly exposed to the cold the remains exposed long enough you'll get frostbite which is like like a permanent affliction so it kind of sucks I've never had it so I never I don't really know how bad it is to have but I don't really want to find out either so let's see here let's go to our clothes here let's organize by conditioned we're gonna go ahead and you'll this up 30 minutes chance to success 70% give it a go good good way to pass time there we go 65% nice just not getting nearly as much anything in interloper mode everything's like just all your actions are a little bit less efficient everything do the 35% I think used to be like 50% maybe tough dojo yeah yeah we screwed we didn't get it that time all right take care of your clothes they'll take care of 50% on the sports vests sure no what am I I'm still not really warm yet I'm warm enough to probably make it there could probably travel now since the weather is good and then we can do our repairs once we get to Carter I think that's a better smarter plan maybe yeah 22 outside let's let's make the best of this and travel while we can if I need to I do have a flair about my only defense that in rocks and rocks are so literally hit and miss even if connect there's the new lookout and Orsola it's over there somewhere all broken into pieces I do feel better not being overweight okay head over this way I thought I had to go up higher don't know what I was thinking so what's what I was doing well if sprain your ankles I don't want to hear any complaints I just want to keep keep pushing forward like a trooper keep soldiering y'all and I don't wanna hear any complaints she sure does complain a lot am I really neglecting her that bad I just gave her some cattails for the love of God let me enter yeah let's take a look here don't want to go for it risk it for a biscuit I think so wait wait wait oh that was a rock it's all that black thing over there thought it was a wolf it was just a rock come out here and it's senator net Rock keeps throwing me off all right now there's two wolves over there near the cabin actually glad I didn't come this way down the tracks I don't went up and around okay that wasn't worth much really I got a couple feathers I guess know pretty bad when you're like oh yes feathers that's awesome it's like my birthday and Christmas all rolled into one and best of all it tickles okay all right next stop that little yellow caboose frostbite 21% I guess I should have probably warmed up all the way before I came but I'm kind of glad I did because I think the weather's gonna change and we should be able to fine yeah we can sleep in the trailers outside of the Carter hydro dam if maybe there's beds there until we find a bed roll could go over here to these trailers dude those are normally pretty good for stuff I think I'm gonna do that yeah I want it yeah cuz I'm not gonna come back this area anytime soon we want to hit these there's a lot of loot spawn areas over here so we don't want to squander this opportunity plus we can warm up in there we can survive a couple days if we need to we get held down by Blizzard for a long like a really long Blizzard all right trip over our feet and go tumbling down and make a big snowball all the way down got like what it felt like been there done that got here more pots no nothing rose hips I need to make some rose hip tea also next time we're brewing need to do some reishi mushroom tea and I need to do some rose hip tea get those medicinal drinks ready ready for those moments when need them that's a whole bed roll so guys were wondering can't pick those up you're like I know I got plenty of comments are like there's a bed roll right there cuz I was looking for one got actually I'm looking for the new one blue it's like blue in color this is just good for cloth can't repair those unfortunately it'd be nice but can't take tipped I hear don't play me I didn't make the game like to me I'd be like old bed roll whatever beggars can't be choosers oops alright get this one too nope missed that one okay alright let's move on to the next next one maybe this was a dumb and wasteful idea but who knows maybe we'll find some good good clothes or something go for some gloves something utter here there's like a can of pop or something thank can I not reach it oh there again okay herbal tea that's always good to have yeah it's good for those emergency times we need really good sleep to recover a lot of condition nice condition bonus I might save my life someday never know at least I have one I really only need one cuz I don't think I've ever really used it where I was like oh god I gotta get this fire started my last match though honestly probably only need to carry one around ever once get your skill high level high enough with the fire starting that's not even a worried concern I guess the only reason want to have it is it really starts fires fast like it guarantees your fire it starts it fast too so if were in a pinch and had a wolf on your butt want to start a campfire to try to scare them away could use that well maybe it's a good good for that reason all right well this was kind of a waste honestly get a couple little things but not not a whole lot yeah she's too cold I need I need to say hang out here for a minute I got rid of this cross bike and hypothermia issue okay let's let's do a little bit more repairs well let me I don't think it will oh it does let it need to eat anything all right lesson learned okay I hear I know I can't believe I'm repairing a vest up to a hundred but here we are I'm not worried about cloth because I have like bed rolls that I can oh wait they require a knife don't they to tear it out I got other stuff like a terrible I think maybe I'll find something don't worry stuff around let's repair these nice 90% Oh sounds like it's a Glee out there I don't like traveling when it's ugly all right ninety-four percent on the jeans 69 on the socks well if I die in the wilderness at least I'll look good oh those are some bright socks look at that forgetting Clorox with bleach decent sweatshirt I think I should I think it's good works at honestly because I'm not getting the full repair amount I really don't wanna waste my sewing kit any more than I have to at this point let's see well what is our look this 13% when proof is only - I really need some new shoes I need to start getting the layers - I got only have two things that are layered and I need some gloves badly all right well we don't want to travel in this this'll actually damage our clothes I just want to take a quick peek outside see how bad it is it's actually not as cold as I expected but it would be very slow going because we would have to walk into that wind and it takes forever so get another drink here I think we just kind of sit here and twiddle our thumbs yeah let's do it past about two hours still raging out there till reagent yeah pretty much the same - the heat of the Sun if it stops then I want to do one more two-hour block if it stops then I'm still Ross Pitt mi7 issues for the Frostbite why cover Flicka terrific all right fine I'm gonna lay in the bed I didn't know that was gonna be an issue I thought I was warmed up like completely warmed up two hours just passing time let's see if that helped with the frostbite it's like twenty one percenters it's 2321 so where other thirsty all right what's my fatigue at can I run I can run let's take a look I might want to go for I don't know I do have beds at car hundred whoo-hoo it's really I'm gonna go for it alright let's go for it I don't want to waste time wasting time wasting calories not getting where I need to go to get the things that I need to survive easier seems like a waste alright just got to keep an eye out here part of me thinks I want to walk up here I get a little bit of high ground we'll have a little bit harder time getting up to my think oh boy oh boy this makes me nervous I'll be alright I'll be okay I do have a escape path here I need need us right down here this she can't remember which side you're supposed to go into yeah does it left your right side again I just want to check it because I'm not going to come back through here for quite a while okay I guess it's the other side searches thing before it's too dark I don't need that I hear don't need that don't need anything here kind of sucked all right let's get to the hydro dam dead guy here and a deer no I don't want to light that Ross but verse 25 to em I do need to like get inside and completely get rid of this respect he's coming back with a vengeance I had like 1% now it's back up to 25 part of me thinks yeah I'm just gonna go into the cabins r2 into the trailers and lay down for the night I'm not gonna be able to search the hydro dam anyway it's too dark they'll have a lantern or anything what I'm gonna use one anyway I just want to run it yeah I had a feeling get a head start on him I just had a gut feeling I'm like know I'm just gonna make a run for it cuz I could probably make it there with the amount of stamina I have oh he's still on my butt hey all right so long sucker hey I got covered - do find the frickin bed this one with the bed this doesn't have a bed for real really really this one doesn't have a bed we're just gonna have to hang out here for a minute let that wolf go away then we'll go over to the other side I thought they both had beds oh my gosh ok there's gonna be a bed sitting right here I just can't see it ok so I'll just hang out here um yeah we'll just hang out here for an hour let that wolf disappear it's our time in here 43 ross spikes 34% holy crap that's not good all right let's run straight across to the next trailer go go go go go made it now I've actually recovered from a moose trampling in this one so I know there's beds yeah there's there's lots of beds all right good okay so we will happily happily eat drink and sleep we're pretty pretty fatigued did yeah we're gonna get some really good sleep unless need it though that should be perfect okay good all right we'll leave this the other one and then we'll head in the Carter hydro dam and go from there well let's get some good sleep here see guys in the morning Oh Clara Frost but might yeah we goes okay good healed was what I was hoping for okay let's holster this thing two days 18 hours 54 minutes and a blister setting in which is okay because we're gonna spend most of that but Blizzard probably looting the hydro Nahum which is a massive place so hopefully we find some good good stuff like a crowbar and a hatchet not hatchet what am I saying hacksaw they both start start with age what are talking about just cuz don't have any food alright run across to see what we were missing in this this one over here but nippy out there had totally picked the wrong one that's okay I need to get away from the wolf though that was the primary concern right there metal shelf yeah see exile did break down we get metal out of that that would be super nice but know what carry the metal all the way to the forge either because that's where we're ultimately heading us to the desolation Point Forge with our hammer to do some blacksmith work well me but make jaraxxus storm storm shadow cloud structured aqua we're gonna make Jax's very happy all right CB never anything at all I'll shove me right into the wolf why don't okay let's get inside I'm just running at this point just to preserve my clothing I don't want to get waterlogged and have it take damage or anything so that's the only reason why I'm giving in to the dark side there what's so frightened here and worm is Shh okay we're gonna have some fun looting the rest of this video cuz there is a lot of a lot to be had in here all right I never ever expect to find anything in filing cabinets this point an interloper actually don't expect to find anything anywhere [Music] [Music] [Music] that lock is that locker always a lock blocker cuz it seems like the last lecture I had it was to open lockers and that one was locked I think Vantage still no line for it up here not seen it anywhere I'd love the finds a fishing tackle might even do a little dance if I found it okay well sue a guy here like 45 46 somewhere around there 15:46 15 maybe 16 46 16 well we're getting close just go slow there we go this stuff will come in handy that was it Wow interloper are hateful you're quite hateful goodness gracious I don't think I've ever had a safe ripped me off that bad after breaking into it I feel I feel like violated for I mean my violet I violated them but then I felt violated because of the yeah we got out of here that looks like a flare to me it's odd it's okay that got me last time all right that up there nothing at all colonel okay there we go [Music] come on baby give me a hacksaw I really need one there's your that let's nap lizard that's crazy but this far in the building and I could still hear it and and it and a crowbar I really want the hacksaw alright nice thing about the heavy hammer - is it pretty good self defense what today against the wolf happen to hook up with one not real I don't think it really kills them that quick but definitely get some off iya it's more of a defensive weapon that offensive weapon and those type of struggles alright got some toilet water for me thank I'll take it all I'll take all your toilet water - no 58 pounds I'll bet look with three gallons I like it I think we're doing okay I think we're doing all right let's head downstairs just make sure there's nothing things are placed in such weird areas now it's like I just need to check everywhere even though I never find it they're in stock around us I mean I'm not gonna find it there an interloper so I really just want to at least look at everything at least once I don't up and just check this area there's never anything up here but give it a look okay curiosity satisfied I thought it said - it's the textile required to search I'm like well since when I wish to have wireless mice I take the cable I view my line Wow ooh that was a good fight that was nice at another sewing kit I like it it's important okay medical locker isn't hot see Oh doesn't anything in it though whatever those are some old old those VCRs and other computers that's C D ok those VHS yeah Wow this is a really old three-and-a-half inch floppies really [Music] come on man hook a brother up please no afflictions which one make sure that frost frostbite had to come back or something crazy I know it said we were covered from the at night but right now it seems to like me for some reason that'd be cool there's something like right in there Wow after the sewing kit goodness gracious so far kind of disappointed [Music] all right I can't get anis gonna know all of us head down into the into the depths wait will it let me know there no wait I can go down this way no probably not oh do I have to wait for a have to wait for Rory to get down there I bet I do I bet they still just blocked off just like they did in a story about no they won't they opened it up okay alright well that was kind of him that's probably they probably meant to do it it's probably a bug all right fire fire bear I used to be over there used to be I'll grab this right forgot about that hold my habits rifle used to be standing over here some does this beautiful thing really quite beautiful [Music] sometimes there was a candy bar up here not anymore okay well what was that about I'm sorry if I'm boring Astrid geez charge trying to keep alive make sure have the tools that have the state to stay alive all right Oh flare excited about players now oh what's wrong with me what's happened the apocalypse used to be such a cozy warm place for me not anymore down there if we go [Music] hey I can walk over that now Kayla yeah but do have to go that way Gosei if I get down here and I get too fatigued I'm gonna be able to climb up that rope and then I'm gonna be in trouble cuz I don't mean we're asleep I don't think there's I don't think there's any beds down here maybe there is oh this is horrible okay know the worst thing is to take out all the items but then leave all the containers to add those items like I guess still gonna search every container though wonder how many times I've passed a hatchet or a hex already I'm guess I'm probably least twice there's probably been two hacks hauls that I passed and know myself and nobody else's notice whoa I don't know can do this back here oh that's new well not new to the game that's just new to me never knew that there's a walkway there that's pretty cool I need to look down though gonna probably walk right over it getting so excited about that little walkway okay no joy they're back here scrap-metal I might come in handy if I don't find a hacksaw anytime soon might need that extra bit of scrap metal yeah I'm gonna start collecting scrap metal until I find the hacksaw oh thank I'll take it definitely a real torch Oh only 37% condition they had a forgettable oh cool another wool scarf I think we can do anything with that we have a wool scarf already plus a little toque okay let's search the backpack down no wait oh shoot now shooting book wonderful exactly what I don't need mmm this will come in handy not really not at all could really go for a storm Lander - I haven't found one of those yet I'm ready to get knocked out I can hear get knocked out by a pencil that's what happened last time I walked in there at least hey really nothing in the entire hydro dam not one tool find that really hard to believe yeah we got ourselves two sewing kits I mean it's really not too hateful honestly those will definitely be Andy if we live long enough to wear our clothes out a little bit or we get attacked enough one of the two once I can make fishing tackle so that was it sort of a moot point but until then coffee it's always good what's that broken something how to say it's broken something broken middle box all control box okay another pot we already know we actually could actually use that now we have to that right order we are have to know we got three okay uh yes let's get rid of that one identical condition so as well get rid of that one oh come on really oh you're so cruel I'm not going out wherever it was that other exit back there not gonna happen it's too scary besides we want to get a coastal Wow well let's head on back I don't know I don't hear the blizzard anymore but that might just be because we're in a different like protected area of the dam or we're not really hearing it know we're like on the other side of the dam the only thing I could think walk this way just for the heck of it okay Trish thing enough just hoping that I'll see something as I'm walking back the blower damn no thank no thank a one-way door ah take that hat look he's got a hat on his head why can't I take it I'm really really trying to make sure I'm not missing anything in this in this particular series normally when I say something like that I immediately miss I think so sorry okay all right let's head back up and let's head on over to coastal let's uh maybe make it up to check Rabbit Island or something like that might stay down to the fishing huts pretty good area all that we'll see we'll see how tired we are when we get there we're about half fatigued so after sleeping all day we've we've actually tuckered ourselves out pretty good just exploring this area is really hoping for a crowbar at least but we'll take it let's see what this one there's like we might be stuck here for a minute oh no we're moving oh my gosh is like cuckoo what was I doing inside that whole time this is like awesome weather clouds are moving quickly across the sky which normally means that there's gonna be a change in weather but I think I guess it's 25 now but know be know mid 20 days no fog no wind all right let's get the hell out of here and we're off over ravine anti costal adventure awaits it takes a long time when I decide not to run oh the nice thing about this place is there's no predators kind of just relax and sort of enjoy the moment of course I've never come through here with on interloper so there might be predators now I don't know how I kiss there could be oh damn it wouldn't have to think about that I would sort of ruin it all for myself peek over here just make sure there's nothing obvious down here I hear some crows Cod Heather over there so check that out see what that is well we don't have enough Sun they get a fire going let's say if it was like a carcass we could probably get a fire going next to it use it a magnified lens but we're not gonna be able to do that too cloudy let's see if it's a guy maybe has a backpack something like that oh my god rabbits kill rabbits especially in this area oh yeah hey tripped it is a dead guy damn it okay well I gotta kind of pin back here so it's all good that's a little high right so we're gonna aim a little lower this time hello well I could have just grabbed him why didn't I just grab him look at em go that all their synchronised fleeing okay they can stop now is it cuz I'm standing right here my scaring them too much really you're gonna make me hit on the run okay okay I'll back off a little bit geez rabbits are they glitch or something no I about to fall to my death yeah I think your glitched oh I thought he's gonna go the same way yeah that will reset I was still freaking the heck out though no I mean he like freaked out his friend oh I was so close okay come here all right I'm gonna back off let him reset as fun as this is almost like my time would be better spent just harvesting some harvesting some cattails ah some lamp you'll see that coming a nice torch or we're still going gosh there's not gonna be any fat left on these rabbits and we did gonna taste horrible everybody said chewy quit burning it quit burning up all your calories I need to eat those myself alright what I really really want is the pelts off of them for my hands let's see if they reset they should have reset by now okay I don't see it bouncing you're kidding me I hit the I hit him come on back holy crap where did that did he just jump off the oh he's coming through the the rock he was literally going through the rock okay I got this one I think turn around I don't get it why am i spooking him that makes no sense I I was I was crouched I just stood up but did he spooked before I even got up all right we're gonna forget about these guys oh maybe not I think I got this one I think I got him finally come this way come on you're going the wrong way bro don't want to go that far for me home

the good weather oh shoot stop running I forgot sorry guys and we're at the hour-long mark here well as a semi-successful rabbit hunt but we're gonna head over here to this cave I'll uh I'll end the episode over here check this cave out real quick don't expect really to find too much over there I'm sure there's more cattails to be had over on the other side of the the trestle there but I didn't go for at this moment are there more rabbits here can't remember what feeling like there should be but I'm not sure yeah look look hole over there all right I wonder some kind hook oh wow look at all these perch trees these birch saplings I so want to chop down know I just break those things in half I just like kick them over take them with me yeah that's so sad have to leave him behind well we know where to find him at least this is all I kind of figured we find in here with some cedar wood but that's okay that's alright alright guys I'm gonna go ahead and end this episode here inside this nice not so warm cave like comment subscribe I'll see guys in the next episode as we continue to coastal highway y'all take care
