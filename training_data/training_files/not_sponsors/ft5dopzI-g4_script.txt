my car just took an important step toward full self-driving I am so excited [Music] hi I'm joy welcome to my channel if you're new here I share my Tesla Model 3 owner experience to help new and future owners learn more about this car if you please consider subscribing this past saturday my car received the 2020 that 12.6 software update this is an important software update because it contains a feature that will allow my car to now stop automatically at traffic lights and stop signs as part of the full self-driving package that I purchased initially I thought I was not going to get this offering release because I thought that this was for early access program participants only clearly I was wrong because I am not part of that group and it looks like Tesla is ready to start rolling out incremental full self-driving City driving features little by little to the fleet so that we can start to train the neural net to recognize signs and traffic conditions and scenarios better to move toward a full self-driving reality down the road for this video I will spend some time on the release notes itself because there are certain conditions that you need to know before you enable this feature if you have the full self-driving computer and a package option purchased we will then go together on my very first Drive after enabling this feature so you can see my own learning curve of this new feature and my first impression and reaction of the traffic light and stop sign self stopping feature so let's go first of all this is a beta version of the software meaning this is still in test mode so you cannot expect this to work perfectly in this release note is says that as with all autopilot features you must continue to pay attention and be ready to take immediate action including braking because this feature may not stop for all traffic controls this feature will be conservative slow down often at first and will not attempt to turn through intersections so this car if you're trying to make a right turn or left turn at an intersection when the light turns green it's just going to go straight so you do need to take control this is only for going in a straight line to enable this feature shift your car into park and tap control out of pilot traffic light and stop sign control beta so I will do that in the minute there's a note here that says when this feature is enabled the maximum set speed while using Auto steer is limited to the speed limit of the road so you can't go faster than the actual speed limit that is going to be displayed on this part of the screen before this feature can be enabled camera calibration may be required and the latest version of navigation maps must be downloaded via Wi-Fi so these are the conditions under which this beta version of traffic light and stops and control would work so let's go ahead and enable this feature under controls out of pilot I am already in the controls so go to autopilot and there it is traffic light and stop sign control beta I'm going to turn this on and the same warning message comes on do you want to enable traffic light and stop site control while it is beta yes I do so now it's turned on and let's go out for a drive okay I'm out on the street road I am going to engage autopilot and as expected this is a green light but it did not detect it was slowing down so that part didn't work out so well but as expected you would see that the speed limit is set to 40 right here and I am NOT able to change it up or down well I could change it down but not to faster so now this is green light but it seems that every green light is is trying to slow down so stop before traffic it keeps telling me it was going to stop for traffic and however many feet so yeah this is very conservative so at each intersection I had to press on the acceleration pedal a little bit just to nudge it forward so that you can continue on so yeah this is not perfect obviously but it is working so far and this is detecting another intersection coming up and I am encouraging my car to drive forward and it is keeping within the lane although it is a little bit choppy it sort of bounces around here and there when there's no marking on the street so this may be a little bit annoying right now to use it and it is very very sensitive so you keep saying stopping for traffic control so I have to step on the accelerator but I know that Tesla is playing it safe right now which I appreciate and I hope that by feeding Tesla all this street data that they are able to perfect this over time oh alright let's turn this on comfirm there's a red light coming up is this stopping for red light there we go very nice and now it's green so I have to put my foot on the accelerator like normal so we'll continue going I will go up to 40 miles per hour because of that use the maximum speed limit set here confirmation yeah there's a confusing - traffic lights back to back so it got confused and you asked me to take over right away and I'm going to remove autopilot because I'm going to make a left turn here all right I made a left turn so I'm turning this back on and I'm going to use the gear stock to confirm that I want to go through this intersection because it's green light and the next one's coming up right away another confirmation I've also noticed I don't think I captured this on camera even if you confirmed that you want to go through that intersection and the light changed and it turned to red your car will stop at the red light so that is a safety issue that you shouldn't worry about but of course you should continue to pay attention with the road condition and brake as needed so confirm [Music] confirm so the next intersection it was green but now it's turning yellow and I was detecting that it had turned to red so even though I confirmed it early on it will stop and it was a little confused when I was just watching the screen right here because if thought I had turned green but the car was still slowing down and now it's at the intersection is seeing the red lights fully and it is stopped as designed now it's green I'm going again but my car wanted to go over there because there's no lane marking in the center of the intersection and it detected that pedestrian on that little island and you thought it was a little too close so it was giving me warning that I was about to hit that person but I wasn't and here I'm going to confirm that I want to go through this intersection and coming up will be a series of stop signs on this road so now we'll see how this reacts to stop signs stopping traffic control in 500 feet so this one has the flashing stop sign in addition to the cipher the camera saw the flashing lights up there first so now I'm going to continue by pressing my accelerator or you can also use the gear stock and now it's coming to the next stop sign and it says stopping for traffic control and it shows a stop sign on the screen and we are fully stopped and oh that's my car you're not following the rule ad you got here later you turn this back on [Music] and here's a big turn coming up [Music] and those were the stops ice and how this would behave as stops ice and there was a phantom breaking just now because there was a car on the side of the street parked and I thought that it was coming to my lane green light I'm going to go head back home just as any other features that Tesla has been releasing over the years this one is no exception there is a little bit of learning curve because it is a behavioral change that you need to train your mind getting used to personally I think I will stick with the pressing on the accelerator method to confirm the notification because I felt that was more natural to me since my foot is constantly right by the brake pedal and the acceleration pedal just in case to take control over the car versus tapping on this gear stock to confirm but that's my preference when you get this update you can try it out both ways and see which one works for you better as I mentioned this is a significant software release that Tesla has done for the general users and this is a milestone that Tesla is marking pushing toward true full self-driving for the general masses and it is not just work Wayne mall or Ford van delivery this is for average people like you and me to have this capability and this is why I am really excited to have this feature and I will be using it as much as possible helping Tesla to train the neural net much much better with that said I have done a few Tesla autopilot rope tests that you can watch right here if you're interested thank you so much for watching and have a blessed week
