welcome to episode 0 of programming memes we're going to be looking at the top memes from the past week and see what the brilliant programmer minds have to offer us from devops dan gonna be one of those days just spent the past two hours debugging why after a test upload of an image when i try to view it i get redirected to an error page turns out i upload a screenshot of an error page now i'd like to tell you i'm better than this that i would just right click open dev tools navigate to the network tab view all the status codes and notice hey look they're all 200 we didn't get any 404s and then immediately click and know that something was wrong but i'm afraid to tell you that's not the case and i've done this exact same thing before and it feels bad man i don't know what it is about being a programmer but you just make the dumbest mistakes and then you spend hours just like beating your head against a wall until you realize you just misspelled a variable name from i am devlopper if you're a company and you need your api testing order 500 worth of pizza and call it a hackathon job done i came here for memes but i'm just getting truth bombs just dropped on me right now this was my life like a couple years ago in college and i was the one sitting there eating pizza testing out capital one's crappy nessie api and the hopes of winning a hundred dollars in aws credit which i would just straight never use but i eventually learned that you don't go to hackathons to compete you just go there to get free swag a new wardrobe and just enjoy the food from life math money dear programmers while binary search is very efficient if a girl asks you to guess her age don't say 50 and then 25. dude this is actually a brilliant idea but the execution is just all wrong her max h is not 100 that's where you went wrong you need to trim your problem space and make a better assumption let's say your max age is 40. our first guess is 20 and we're golden oh this just gave me a brilliant idea okay this is what i'm thinking you know those videos where the guy goes up to a girl on a coffee shop and he's trying to get her number and what they end up doing is end up playing rock paper scissors for and if he wins he gets her number so i'm thinking the exact same thing but instead of playing wrong paper scissors you're trying to guess her age and if you're able to guess her age and log in time you get her number and so all you do is you perform binary search but every time you guess a number since you know we don't know up or down what we do is we look at her reaction and depending on how much her eyebrows go up or down we didn't know whether our age was too high or too low yeah that's a good idea right okay maybe not mom can we get an if statement no honey we have an if statement at home if statement at home i'm not gonna lie this actually took me a second to get whenever i see while loops i just assume infinite loop joke incoming so this was actually like slightly original i kind of like it when i type the whole line without syntax error dot dot my ide finally someone who speaks english there's no way he didn't have a syntax error the first time when you start coding in a new language without reading the documentation i don't know what the heck happened to me when i was a kid i don't know how many times i was dropped on my head but i actually don't mind reading documentation i i don't know when the employer wants you to have six plus years experience in javascript python java react vue laravel rails my sequel greek history aerodynamics human anatomy etc just to manage their wordpress site also don't forget to learn how to invert a binary achieve which you're going to need for their whiteboard interview your new datepicker widget has crashed really that's impossible i've tested it with native numbers special characters null whatever you put in it a date dang i've done this if you couldn't tell at this point programming memes aren't funny they're just relatable and very sad finding your code in a job or project be like source test java class wrapper class subclass actual fudging code java problems am i right it's all about that kotlin these days are you hired son no what a beautiful meme i just love lee code memes he's just laying there on the ground crying probably after like spending four hours on elite code easy problem he did last month and just forgot the solution to when i spend two hours trying to optimize my code to make it run faster and the result runs eight times slower than the original am i disabled turns out kids o event is sometimes faster than login who would have known it all i want to know is will elon musk's nero link have an api and can i get my memories in json format json i want mine in the ammo bro are you coming to bed i can't this is important what someone is wrong on stack overflow one second honey i need to crush this programmers hopes and dreams mark their question as duplicate off topic report them and make sure they never come back to this site and never want to program again i use dark the because light attracts bugs me too yet his meme is in light theme my code luck old repositories indian guy on youtube stackoverflow google friday we have reached the stale memes it's time to take a break you
