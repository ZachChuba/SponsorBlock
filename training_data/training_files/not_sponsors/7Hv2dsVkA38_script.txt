you to think like an engineer at the height of the cold war with nuclear anxiety at a fever pitch the united states launched their first spy satellites the corona tasked with photographing deep inside the soviet union us intelligence was focused on searching for signs of nuclear weapon development and testing but found a lot more than they bargained for these early satellites were launched with rolls of film with no way of transmitting the data contained within them to earth through electronic means and thus the film had to be recovered and developed here on earth once the film was filled the satellite would eject a re-entry vehicle containing the precious undeveloped photos back to earth where they could be caught by a passing plane as they drifted down on one such mission a strange object began to emerge from the caspian sea as the film developed a gigantic aircraft nearly 100 meters long with short stubby wings much too short to fly like a conventional aircraft us intelligence had never seen anything like it as they received more pictures it was clear the craft was moving at the same speed as a traditional aircraft while outsizing even the largest of modern day american military planes like the lockheed c5m it was even emblazoned with the flag of the soviet navy not the soviet air force this discovery set alarm bells off within u.s intelligence had the soviets developed a breakthrough in propulsion which could give them the upper hand in naval combat confused on what they were seeing the us dubbed the machine the caspian sea monster but the soviets weren't developing a gigantic hydrofoil or seaplane this giant aircraft secretly being developed was actually an ecranoplan a gigantic vessel capable of skimming across the ocean's surface at high speeds in 1962 the central hydrofoil design bureau assigned chief designer rastaslav alexiev to begin working on a prototype plane alexeyev had cut his teeth developing hydrofoil planes like the raquetta these craft can easily be defined as a boat they used a hydrofoil essentially a wing designed to act in water to lift the boat's hull out of the water as against speed allowing it to reduce drag and increase top speeds but the soviets wanted to take this a step further the chronoplan would make use of something called ground effect to fly at a very low altitude above the ocean's surface ground effect occurs when a fixed wing aircraft flies at an altitude less than the length of its wingspan as large masses of air come into contact with the aircraft the profile of the wing deflects the air downwards compressing the air between the wing and the ground this trapped air can cause an area of higher than normal pressure under the wing resulting in a boost to lift this happens with all aircraft during takeoff and landing and is something all pilots have to learn to deal with for example some planes can get off the ground when overloaded but won't be able to climb past the altitude where ground effect is in play ekranoplans are designed in such a way to maximize this effect and never leave the ground effect zone just as our plane can get off the ground when overloaded the ukranoplan can be heavier without the need for extra power an aircraft with this ability could be a powerful tool in open sea combat it would fly under enemy radar for much longer due to the radar shadow under the earth's curvature it would be capable of transporting tons of equipment and personnel quickly while avoiding enemy mines and torpedoes or it could be fitted with weapons of its own to quickly attack enemy ships before escaping imagine if a vehicle like this was available for the d-day landings the largest amphibious assault in history the allies would have been able to transport tons of equipment and troops across the channel in a 15-minute trip the appeal of the technology was enormous and the first prototype named the km was built and secretly transported to the caspian sea to begin testing this enormous vehicle instantly became the largest aircraft ever built with a wingspan of 37.6 meters and a length of 92 meters it weighed a massive 240 tonnes but it could take off with almost double that powered by eight dobrynin vd7 turbo jets mounted at the front and two on the tail which provided a total of 1 275 kilonewtons of thrust about 30 percent more than a boeing 747 the first test flight of the km took place on the 16th of october 1966 with chief designer alexiev on board at the time it was forbidden for soviet aircraft designers to be on board test vehicles like this in case they were involved in an accident but test pilot vladimir loganoff lobbied for alexiev to be on board to allow him to experience and refine his designs the first tests were successful showing the km could fly with optimum fuel efficiency at 430 kilometers per hour and with a maximum operational speed of 500 kilometers per hour during some high-speed tests it's claimed that it achieved a speed of 650 kilometers per hour the km was a valuable proof of concept and laid the groundwork for all future ecranoplants alexiev took the lessons learned and began to develop a new transport version designed specifically for the transport of military equipment and troops called the orleonock this was a much smaller variant 58 meters long with a 31.5 meter wingspan and a maximum takeoff weight of 140 metric tons its engine layout was fascinating with a massive mk12 turboprop engine mounted on the tail as far away from the salt water as possible these massive six meter diameter counter rotating turbo propellers developed 11 000 kilowatts of power making it the most powerful turboprop engine to ever enter service it also featured two nose-mounted turbofan engines with air intakes on top of the nose to minimize water intake the exhaust of these engines were pointed under the wings to enhance the ground effect phenomenon by bolstering the air cushion with the high pressure output of the jet engine these engines were only needed on takeoff before the plane could gain the speed needed to develop enough lift through the wing and ground effect once this was achieved they were shut down to decrease fuel consumption the orleanuk featured a nose-mounted cargo door and wheels to allow the plane to drive onto land and unload this was a fully functional ecranoplan and actually entered and remained in service until 1993 although only four were ever built details from here vary and i found it difficult to find an authoritative source of information on what happened to alexiev after the development of the orlando knock was complete some say he crashed in the km others in the orleans and others say he crashed in a volga too a small passenger transport akranoplan but they all seem to point towards alexia have been fired as chief designer as a result and dying a short time later whether that was from injuries from the crash or natural causes i have no idea with alexiev out of the picture and the soviet union on the brink of collapse development of akronoplans in the soviet union slowly began to fizzle out they managed to develop a slightly smaller version of the km designed to launch anti-ship missiles while out at sea in 1987 the first version of this vehicle was built and named the lun this vehicle weighed 286 tons had a length of 74 meters and a wingspan of 44 meters the tail mounted engines were removed completely it was instead powered by eight nk 87 turbofans mounted on the front of the craft each producing 127 kilonewtons of thrust valon entered the soviet navy in 1987 however with the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 only one model was ever completed and it remains in its dry dock on the shores of the caspian sea to this day the idea of a wing and ground effect plane has its merits but it has simply never found its niche in any military the germans made a smaller acronym plan in the 70s called the x-114 but it never made it into service the chinese also experimented with an acronym plan called the xtw4 which was built in 1999 and went through multiple tests a year later the vehicle was once spotted in a chinese shipping port on google maps but has since vanished while in 2002 boeing presented their plans to build the largest ecranoplan ever dubbed the pelican they claimed the craft would be longer than a football field and capable of hauling 17 m1 abram tanks across an ocean but the u.s congress rejected the plans in 2005 there just wasn't a need for such a plane wing in ground effect planes may yet find their niche but for now safety and reliability concerns are its primary roadblock flying at such a low altitude provides very little time for corrective maneuvers and poor weather with high waves or wind prevents any ekranoplan from operating some have sought to develop smaller passenger versions like the a050 which the russian embassy of south africa your definitive russian news source claimed it would be ready for service in the next three years vehicles like this could find a valuable niche in archipelago regions like southeast asia where increasing wealth and populations combined with relatively short distances between islands could provide a market for these temperamental craft however traditional planes will always remain a much more efficient and reliable form of transport over long distances as flying in the lower density air of the upper atmosphere drastically decreases drag so these passenger versions would have to operate extremely short haul distances where airliners waste time during climbing and ascent this technology is perfectly viable for the right application and we may yet see someone solve the problem and build a successful
