make your next move with Squarespace this is Hollywood and this is you Hollywood thinks they're better than you it's a regular person but but they also want your money so they try to appeal to you in an effort to take said money they try to relate to you but they just can't I know what it's like to be middle-class your housekeeper only comes like probably once a week right Hollywood is painfully out of touch with normal regular people and here are seven of the funniest ways that you can tell number one they have no concept of how money works yes those rich Hollywood elites try to write stories about normal people and it just doesn't work sure normal people like the ones that make six figures a year that sounds about right is it even possible to live on six figures a year I guess maybe if you don't eat out that much like for example any time you have a story about a struggling artist just moved to New York trying to make ends meet their apartment is still amazing how I've looked into it I know how much it costs to live there I came to New York to follow my dream just waiting for my big break wait but isn't your big break the fact that you can somehow manage to afford this 1,500 square foot apartment and Manhattan without a job this place is a dump look at that exposed brick and do you hear all those sirens this is a really bad neighborhood well like these Hollywood types can can they cannot envision not living comfortably they're poor but they still have like a nice a nicest house because how could you not have that right okay number two bachelor and bachelorette parties movies make these stupid parties like the most important thing in the whole world but in real life the only person who gets excited about a bachelor party is this guy oh yeah you know it's beer o'clock because I'm looking for an excuse to true normal people don't care about this stuff they actually hate going to them oh look I guess I'm in charge of your bachelor party because I'm the best yeah just get some pizza with the guys and a public call duty yeah that sounds fine well my bachelor party true story we just hung out and played a Nintendo at my parents house guys and girls we just hung out my mom made dinner it was really nice but in movies people like fly places girls are like popping out of cakes like they leave this state to go have a weekend somewhere again I asked who has this kind of money look I don't know how to say this nicely but with the divorce rate as high as it is I'm not spending money on your bachelor party but I'm certainly not getting on an airplane in this day and age risk my life for that No number three normal people don't do drugs look okay maybe I'm a little shelter we've probably already established that it was really nice what normal people don't do drugs where do you even get drugs what kind of life choices lead you to being around the kind of person that could deal you drugs but in movies it's like everybody's got drugs everybody knows a dealer except me again maybe I'm sheltered I just legitimately don't understand where you get drugs no no that's not no I don't number four nobody goes to strip clubs and movies people go to strip clubs often it's just like a normal place where they hang out and you know I get it okay it's an easy way to get some nudity into your movies very exciting great script but uh where's the sex oh well it's it's a fast-paced movie we couldn't really fit it in okay you're clearly not using your imagination what if the guy's car crashes into our strip club that'll be awesome and I want to see everything uh sir we're shooting for pg-13 no no I want to be on set that day that's the kind of person who actually goes to strip clubs Hollywood executives I think that's the usual clientele number five they have no concept of how the internet works people in Hollywood think that it's super easy for something to go viral on the internet like anything at any moment could just conveniently go viral well I guess it's the end of the line I couldn't make enough money to pay our dog surgery look Josh I posted a video on a site that looks like YouTube but isn't actually YouTube sharing our dog story and now a ton of donations are coming in Wow looks like doggies gonna get the surgery she deserves truly touching but honestly I don't blame these entitled Hollywood executives I mean this has been their experience on the internet lately I mean we post those clips of the late night shows on YouTube every day and they get millions of views totally organically it's always trending so number six they have literally no concept of how doctors work for regular people look I don't know how a visit to the doctor actually works when you're rich and famous but if TV and movies are to be believed you apparently get to actually go into the doctor's office like an actual nice office and you have a nice long one-on-one conversation with this doctor where they explain everything you need to know very patiently it's the craziest least realistic thing I've ever seen like the strip club makes more sense because see for the poor little peasants in the rest of the country going to the doctor is a very different experience hi I'm the doctor I'm experiencing some pain and might be quite experiencing some pain in your white breathe for me what do you think the pain could be ain't no hand you some pills okay goodbye and finally number seven they assume everyone is a Democrat or you as sympathetic and smart character in a movie oh then congratulations you're a Democrat 100% of the time with absolutely no exception look the way Hollywood sees it no reasonable person would ever not be a Democrat so all good characters voted for Obama look I get it I'm from Tennessee okay there's a conservative bubble here but at least I'm aware I'm in a bubble you know and and I don't think Hollywood realizes it I think that they really think that if you vote for anyone other than a Democrat then you're like a one-note villain in an action movie well well well a dirty little liberal I have you right where I want you first I'm gonna pollute your yard then I'm gonna sell you into slavery because everything has a price on the free market we please take me to the hospital at least when you're done with me can't I'm taking away your healthcare - Squarespace this YouTube channel
