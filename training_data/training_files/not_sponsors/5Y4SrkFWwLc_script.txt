you know I'd like to be a hundred percent which are so I'm gonna be a hundred percent with y'all yeah I haven't seen up after the draft or a ground don't stop actually in a minute so don't forget that today bro make sure I get that Rosi Rosi be fire make sure you guys subscribe to the channel trying to post notary's like the video because this video is gone tell a lot of truths a lot of questions will be answered some people might be pissed off some people might be mad at me but I'm just speaking the truth the real saying hi I know you guys see me rocking a og tryout shirt this one is the one that got me my opportunity honestly my agent sent me email he say these CFL team is having a tryout at IMG I know it's really close to you are you interested and I was like you know what yeah I am cuz I'm trying to get my name in the books I'm trying to you know get my opportunity to get my shot I showed up to the tryout three other kickers there three of which who were veterans three of which played in the league one of them was like a NFL veteran John Ryan he's a punter he played for Seahawks few years and compared to all of them my skills were up to par if not better but basically I left the tryout I made a video there you guys would call the video I left to tryout and I you know waited for my call and eventually they just blow is is destroying we want to bring you onto our team go ahead and meet me I know you 25 de to five bay - energy as I was saying bro I got the call after the tryout and they're like hey man we like what you did we want to bring you into training camp we want to see what you're made of we want to see what you could do who wanna see you compete for the spot you know so I was excited because I just went out there to try out you feel me no cap I went out to get some content I knew it's gonna do a good video I know it's gonna get some views of course I'm passionate about football but I always envisioned myself in the NFL I always envisioned myself kicking at the highest level or never the CFL but I'm grateful for the opportunity anyways I got the call to come to training camp you know it's kind of short notice bro they called me boys it it was like two days before you had to go yeah it was like two days before was they called me like what May 16 17 and I had to pack my things up and literally move to Canada in two days so it kind of threw me out of a spiral my apartment I didn't know what to do I'm still paying rent on that I just didn't know what to do but you know I took the opportunity I went out to Canadian Canadian oh I call it Canadian ain't no I I sit on this journey Brian know what it held in store for me I don't know what to expect I don't know what I was gonna be doing all I know is I was gonna be following my passion and kicking footballs man little did I know I had to not only kick at the highest level but punt at the highest level to even have a chance of playing to even have a chance let me emphasize to even have a chance I'm explain to you a real quick some very important and the Canadian Football League there's something called a ratio which is the amount of Canadian football players and amount of American football players you have on the team playing at one time you can have 21 Americans I think 23 Canadians and like to international which is from you know different countries all over the world those skill positions the guys that are really good well not the guys are really good everybody's really good but the guys are the most important are usually American Pickers punters long snappers physicians like that are usually Canadian alright so here I am on my first day camp and I show up and there is war other kickers bro or other kickers and myself so five five Cougars in a camp brush unheard of it's usually two guys three guys tops but five including myself it's freakin unheard of bro not only is there going to be minimal reps for each person but like it's five people dog through our camp not even gonna lie bruh I probably got like five Google rips maybe like eight punts it wasn't the right competing environment we ain't get to show what we could do during the tryout I got probably five times more rest than I would during camp so like although I just didn't make much sense you know sitting here grinding campus literally from like 8:00 in the morning 8:00 at night you know I told myself to say ten toes down destroy you've worked so hard to get here you've gone but I'll just keep going everything's gonna play out right so during camp I did all I had to do I kicked good hunting could have used some work the situation wasn't the greatest problem so it kind of rubbed me the wrong way kind of ticked me off a little bit and this whole time brother they're just eating it up bro I'm doing all these interviews for SIA field I'm doing all this all these little story takeovers I'm doing all this Argonaut stuff this and that basically organized Instagram and social medias blowing up right now they went from forty four thousand Instagram followers before I showed up to now hundred into so I kind of figured where this was going I hate to admit it but I kind of saw what was going down when they brought these joint into this freaking camp they were growing on social media but at the same time I'm growing all social media I gained probably 150 K subscribers for I hunt K on like 50 K maybe so my stuff is growing but they're growing on exponentially it sounds were even head coaches that yo was good you know joking around of course coach chambers a great guy but it was very obvious that I was a big-time youtuber I had a following and I guess they saw the benefits man so anyways I'm here at training camp working out do what I have to do and things are slowing down for me because I don't have as much time to work on what I have to I went from putting out three videos a week to what one like every two weeks kind of daily yeah I barely uploaded for this whole time I was in camp outside damn brat could be making so much money right now my views it's like trending back to back back to back I could be taking advantage of this I could be making so much bread bro that's not even get started on how much spread you make has a CFL kicker we gonna talk about that later but no I knew there was but trying to keep my focus I try to keep going I try to tell myself reach out to us and I keep working keep grinding keep practicing keep getting better you know this is the beginning this is opportunity you needed you know once you get on that fear this oh no they not really take a new serious right now but once you get on that field burst OH so anyways preseason game one comes and like I said there was five of us bro five of us turns out I was the third string kicker third string pump they made two kickers go ahead of me and two putters go ahead of me and all they let me take was to kick off second I've been kicking field goals good I'll camp out in front well I can and dandy if you let me show it I could do during the game they just let me kick the ball off the oh we're rotating you you want to see what you guys got it's like Brad did kickoffs all who [ __ ] you see ya bro there's a ton of film on that let me show what I could do on the field goals let me show where I could do on a punt and let me show y'all that I'm not a sleeper that whoa that I am a sleeper David sleeping on me but I could do what I do you feel me so I got to kick off that game did pretty well for the kickoffs I told myself the opportunities you get just take a vision there's just no you do kickoffs kick them kickoffs as best as you [ __ ] can dodge you'll meet your times gonna just be patient do I stay patient kept working sure if the camp every single day did not complain did not let my videos get in the way of anything I was doing on the field like I was a football player first youtuber second straight up straight like that so training camp goes by pre students game number two gets here am I gonna get my chance now I'm gonna get my shot now that game I got two field goals in one punt first field goal 46 yarder into the wind hit the [ __ ] out of it went over the pole literally over the post angle I was nervous first kick ever professionally I was nervous at the jitters but trust me I made the [ __ ] kick refs look at each other for like five seconds to then they're like game taking kick made that had a good punt you know I feel like I showed pretty decent things on film that game was the game that kind of decided if you made the cuts or you were kicked off they made their cuts they cut away at the cut they kept through that cap and they kept me on the practice squad basically told me keep working we see your talent see what you're made up we see what you can do with just a little more consistency doll and you're gonna be a frickin star like alright cool let me call it my guy Marquette let me go work with him let me do what I have to do and I grinded bro put in so much work so motivating I'm so happy I'm getting a shot as a profession oh [ __ ] just again didn't work how high walnuts so they added me to the practice roster basically they cut two guys the punter and kicker they were like alright you're on the practice rosters I know I'm not starting at either punter or kicker but it's a start and get my opportunity but just keep working hard if I just keep doing my thang you know she's gonna play I'm gonna get my chance I'm getting my shot all it takes is for a starting guy so you know mess up or go down or whatever of course I'm not wishing bad on anybody but I want to play you feel me we've won get here it wasn't the greatest result we lost our first game our punter ended up getting hurt by the way I never like seen some out of gear I never liked seeing anything bad happen anyone I always wish the best for everyone I'm like alright cool [ __ ] this might be my shot let me start getting ready let me start working let me start doing what I do turns out I show it to practice today after the game bro and they brought in a Canadian punter I checked the depth chart guy from camp was brought in and he started heading so it doesn't make sense they cut this guy and kept me on the practice squad I'm thinking like what's going on with this is not really too fair you know of course it's a business I understand life's not fair I'm not bitching ain't that how it's supposed to go I'm supposed to be the next man up maybe I didn't show the coaches enough of my punching skills for me to you know start and for me to play so bruh I'm telling y'all I've grinded I've literally put my all y'all see me use you see all the pun I've been doing bro haven't been doing as much kidding y'all see all the pun I've been working on cuz I won't be better the thing about me is if I like at something I'm gonna do all that I have to do to bring that up to par so I've been grinding I've been working my partner that's gone up I talked to mark kickin he got me right at the end of the day they still brought another punter but that really hurt me and it really showed me like what the deal was cuz they still kept me on a practice squad and then they started this other guy that just came in so no anyways whatever that passes by another game goes by kicker doesn't have a great game during game comes guy died doesn't have a great game again he ended up missing the kick towards the end of the game or like a kick off or something like that and that kind of wrapping it up for him they cut him after the game don't they an outright kicker messed up now I'm the next man now am i kicking his own point I'm doing what I got to do you feel me turns out I shove the price the next day bro and they bringing the hood the guy they cut from camp before the kicker they bring him in and make him the star kicker and still have me on practice so it's like bro what what is going on which something's not adding up they're not cutting me they're not getting rid of me but yet they're not giving me a chance to play that I give me a chance to I don't know what the deal is everyone's cool everyone's still call me YouTube dissing hambo you to bang get his [ __ ] shot to kick I'm sorry I'm getting frustrated over this brush like obviously I don't suck obviously I can make a [ __ ] cape like I don't know what it is bro and at this point it's like man I'm sitting out here in Toronto I'm not posting as many videos as I want to my YouTube is slowing down I'm getting paid five hundred seventy-five dollars Canadian dollars a week which is equal to maybe three hundred song you know I'm thankful but I added up two hours and I added up two times and it equals roughly $10 an hour week so I'm basically a professional player at this point on a practice roster making minimum wage my YouTube business putting a car my possessions putting a house my possessions putting you know a lot of things in my possession a lot of things I'd never thought I could be able to afford a lot of things I'm never gonna be able to give my life and basically this is slowing down for this $10 hour job I see that possibilities I see the opportunities of this job but at the same time Charlie Brown's money you feel me so it's weird I'm stuck in a pickle now the team is six seven games in we haven't won a game yet I don't know what's going on kickers and punters are doing what they have to still on a practice squad and right now I'm currently in Florida since I'm a practice squad player my GM was like you know you're on a practice squad right now so I know you have another business so I know you have things to take care of I know you got things to do so I'm not gonna hold you back from that just let me know what advanced communicate with me and I'll let you know that's why I took that trip to Arizona that's why I took that trip to France so I came back and our team has a three-week road trip where they go on the west coast of Canada they don't travel everyone they only travel around five practice squad players and the GM was like you know there's no point in taking another kicker with us if we need you if something happens we'll call you but for right now you're suspended go home handle what you have to handle shoot your videos do what you got to do they should be back from their trip after the Logan Paul event which is the 27th of July and I guess I should I'm going back to Toronto after that and a lot of things have not gone my way a lot of things have gone my way up thankful for a lot of things I'm thinking for an opportunity I'm thinking for everything but [ __ ] I guess I have work to do man I'm not good enough I'm staying tencel's now make sure y'all stay ten toes down to incop demurrer shopping store combo and i'm keep working I'm young I'm 22 years old I got a [ __ ] Canada up a leg I have a bright future so we just don't keep working I hope you guys kind of understand what's going on I hope you guys understand my situation and stuff asking me about [ __ ] and don't go to Toronto Instagram page and go to comments and blah blah blah see all y'all's comments and it's annoying the guy who runs social media is not the [ __ ] head coach so he don't decide about they're not so stop saying or do playboy I appreciate the love but stop and after this video come out don't
