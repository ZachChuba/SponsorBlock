hey it's Tesla Canuck welcome back to another video today I got a software update I got 20 20.12 dot 11.1 I think this is a first for Canada so we're gonna go for a drive first let's take a look at the release notes okay so in the release notes there's nothing really different over the last update so that's likely that Canadians are not going to see the automatic stopping at stop lights and and at stop signs in this release we're probably still lagging another couple months behind our US friends who already have that feature but nonetheless let's go and try it out you know I always like to try things that maybe aren't in the release notes see if there's been any improvements that type of stuff why not because Tesla sometimes does that let's get started okay so the first thing we're gonna do here is let's put this into autopilot go back to speed a little bit and we are cruising down this main kind of strip here and we are going to come it looks like they were going to arrive at a red light which is fantastic I'm not gonna let it go too long because this is going to be a busy intersection well it was before this whole covet thing but let's see what happens and it's it's wait wait no okay I think it started slowing down there because it saw the truck not because it saw the light so yeah that I don't think I don't think it's gonna stop automatically so if you're in Canada you get this release I just tried it for you I know it's not in the release notes but nonetheless confirmed it is not going to stop for a red light so let's let's keep going for a drive here and test out a few other things are going to make my way over to the highway and we'll do a little bit of a cruise see if there's any noticeable difference in terms of the autopilot and how it behaves and I see there's a slow tractor up ahead lovely okay my first driving video in a long time and I'm gonna have to deal with that let's see what happens alright let me let me know if in the comments if this ever happens to you do you live kind of in a rural area where you know you get this kind of thing it's a double line here it's a double line I know I know I know I know it's coming up on a single line coming up we're going to gun it we're going to gun it and gun yes we will oh yeah baby oh yeah gotta love that acceleration especially when you need to get ahead of a tractor going five miles an hour okay so yeah the Tesla could do that prior to 20 20.12 dot 11.1 so nothing new they're just having a little fun we are coming up on a green light wait a minute did it notice that speed sign it never used to do that here used to keep going 80 all the way through did it notice the speed sign okay we are going to have to test that again that would be something very new at least for me I've not seen that before maybe others have but I have not so that would be absolutely fantastic to have it recognize the speed signs and the interesting thing interesting thing there is that it's a construction zone so that would be very very helpful alright we're going to head on to the freeway here I need to go a different direction than usual just to change it up for you guys let's have a little fun here okay we are in autopilot let's check our settings here and okay yes we're gonna customize we're going to go to Mad Max I always like to do Mad Max for these tests although it might not be busy enough for action first I actually test Mad Max this is a fraction of the traffic that you would normally see but I think we're good here let's crank it up a little bit we've got this fancy what is that it's a Toyota something was that a Supra I have no idea what the hell that is it's got a nice side gold rims on it too bad it it's a ice vehicle gonna do a lane change here and I don't think there's anything really new to report there ever since the last update I have noticed though that in this situation here where there are no other cars around it didn't have to make a fast lane change you saw how gradually it just kind of meandered over which is really interesting so obviously it's a where that it has plenty of time plenty of space and it just takes a nice easy lane change very comfortable for the driver and the passenger passengers unless you're looking for excitement in which case that would be quite boring you know the speed limit here I always mention it it's a hundred kilometers an hour which is 62 miles per hour and usually I can't catch up to people so the whole Mad Max test kind of sucks sorry about that but all right let's just do some random lane changes what the heck again look at this nice and easy there's nothing else around it takes its time I'm just going to keep doing lane changes oh it would help if I showed you the map sorry about that that's pretty Canadian to me right okay I'm going to squeeze between those two cars and see you know what Mad Max does to take us out of it [Music] okay so puts the brakes on you can see now we're going quite slow let's put in a destination navigate to Nottawasaga in Wow totally got that well kind of not it was Saiga River okay that's kind of not where I want to go but what the heck so I think Mad Max didn't do anything there because I had actually manually put us into the lane and I think what happens there is there's a period of time that goes by before it starts making aggressive lane changes and it knows right now we're going to exit a lot of construction here so this is going to be a great test for this latest version of of the tesla software let's see what happens here okay that was pretty easy there aren't any construction cones here at the exit going aggressively into the curve up she's slowing down now okay [Music] there's definitely some construction Messier okay nice to navigate it nice and navigate it yeah so there you go the when you get here there's no difference in the navigator on autopilot once you exit the freeway you have to take over so no changes there navigate on autopilot here dudes fishing or is he fishing I don't know I don't think there's any water there I'm not sure what that guy's do it interesting is saw the if you look at the barriers up here on either side let's see if it does it again kind of shows them as cones now it's not showing them as anything I found at least before this update I'm gonna have to do some more testing but it definitely showed everything as cones I think that's pretty widely reported yeah oh well no I kind of showed it as I'm gonna have to see what that looks like when I produce the video because I'm not sure show cones there looked like it was actually like girders separators or something that was interesting how it slowed down coming up the hill it could have been the Sun or something perhaps it couldn't quite get the the angle and there's just being yeah it is coming across as as like posts okay that's that's new because before was showing everything as pylons so that's great that's at least I never noticed that being different on the previous release it was still showing as cones traffic cones as far as I'm aware that'd be really great if the visualizations now are supporting a much broader yeah very cool now it's interesting that it shows the the posts at least some of them but it's only showing them on the driver side whereas on the passenger side those posts are actually much closer to the vehicle but it didn't show them but nonetheless I'm very excited to see different types of visualizations that's cool all right so I am going to actually make a right here and I want to try to see if we can come across a stop sign let's just do this one more time and also - I want to see if it notices any more of the speed signs or if that was just a fluke I'm not sure yet worst-case scenario I just take you guys out for a country Drive even if stopping at stop signs isn't in the this release for us Canadians which obviously it isn't but you know I'm a sucker for punishment I'm gonna keep going keep testing it who knows maybe something different will happen what else do you have to do right most of us are still stuck at home so this is actually my first time out for a drive in filming a driving video since probably early March alright so up here just coming up on my right-hand side this is gonna be for my my good friend out there in Minneapolis or just outside Minneapolis fluffy bunnies up here is the Toronto skydive school so anyhow I know that you're big into skydiving thought you might find this interesting so I'm just pointing it out to you and in the summertime it's really cool because you can actually see a bunch of people parachuting in the sky it's kind of cool the option they actually have hot air balloons as well okay I don't think the car is going to stop for the stop sign okay yeah that's not gonna happen okay let's go this way you're going to make right and over there that's where the I got the planes park or whatever you want to call it I know if you call that thing a hangar but maybe it is for small planes but that's for you fluffy fluffy bunnies just wanted to point that out alright bye now it's pretty clear that cuss Canadians we don't get any stopping at the stoplight so I'm going to manually intervene here we're gonna head back onto the freeway hopefully we'll hit a little bit more traffic than we did and see if we can come across anything interesting alright we've got quite a bit of construction up here the entrance to the highway I know is pretty buggered up let's see what happens here I'm hoping it actually starts to slow down okay I've got to slow it down that's okay we've got plenty of pylons it's gonna stop because there's a car in front of me here that's nothing new it thinks that I have to turn left but because of the construction I actually have to turn right so let's do that just like they're building a new bridge here or something so it probably wants me to go that way I'm going to override just because I'm familiar with this construction so I'm going to go this way and we'll get back onto the highway now it's interesting because in a real world full self-driving situation and Elon has said Robo taxi will be functionally ready this year look at a situation like that and it just makes me wonder if it will be ready this year because that interchange is so buggered up from construction I'm not really certain how the software would handle it at least from what I've seen so far maybe the the versions that are in beta 4 or alpha or whatever they're in for the full self-driving Robo taxi are just so far advanced that none of us Tesla youtubers can even contemplate how they might work but that would be a hugely tricky situation it's even tricky for a human who's never been through there to figure out what's going on so I guess that you know the jury's out we will see what is going to be accomplished I'm fairly certain that it's going to be Robo taxi ready for California not necessarily northern climates with a full-on winter season I just can't see that being solved anytime soon with the existing hardware but yeah we'll see well let me know what you think in the comments Ilan says 2024 Robo taxi software being functionally ready do you believe it I'm skeptical about it I'll just throw that out there we're heading into our final test here so we're going to exit the highway there we go it always takes this exit aggressively this is a pretty sharp turn so let's see if there's been any improvements okay there has been improvement here on a sharp curve hands down no doubt about it I used to have to hold on to my you-know-what taking that curve so definitely improvement very nice okay here we've got a green light but it's slowing down I'm gonna override it just because we get caught at that yellow there so what can I conclude about that obviously it didn't recognize the green light that's for sure and I think when you come off the highway with navigate on autopilot it's going to add an intersection there I think it's going to stop at least here in Canada where we don't have the traffic light signals just it's going to stop because it thinks that's the end of the off-ramp that's my that's I'm just speculating there but that's what I think because normally I hit that at a red light I very rarely hit that at a green light but that's how I think it works all right that is that is it for today thank you very much for joining me on this nice country Drive with 20 2012 dot 11.1 that's a mouthful to say let me know your thoughts in the comments hit that
