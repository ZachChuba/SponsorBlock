in trading about our eighth of the burn now comes the more difficult part of making sure we don't burn too much and burn holes in it I think we're on track to finishing early actually those might be famous last words if this doesn't work as a canoe they look at the coffin month ago I started the reset of our channel with a new challenge of rebuilding myself chronologically from the start of human history exploring the question of life an average person with a basic understanding of humanity's history and beast concepts could rebuild themselves back up to modern society up to now I've learned the skills to produce and acquired the resources for a few basic tools now to apply them to our largest project yet a form of transportation crossing large bodies of water has been a crucial development of humanity allowed us to spread around the world even to isolated regions like Australia in the numerous islands of the Pacific when the first boat was invented and how exactly was built a relatively unknown over the earliest recovered boat is a dugout dating back around 8000 BCE the Pesa canoe dugout canoes developed pretty much everywhere in the world where large trees grow and have a long history of use even through to today their size and complexity can vary dramatically but all are built on the same concept of how we now to a single tree well likely one of the first forms of boats made they are far from easy to produce and are well known for being very time-consuming potentially taking up several weeks to complete even with more modern tools while I was in England visited archaeological farm punts their farm to learn foot napping in my previous video in copper smelting in an upcoming one I also got to see a few of their dugouts that they've produced and learn a few of their tips this one's made from Scott spawn we tested tools from all different time periods on this to see the rate of progress but there was a lot of moisture when we've done this it only been down about two years so the fire didn't work too well on there I had to spend a week living in a shelter like that because we wanted to keep the fire going for a whole week so we took turns and when it starts to split you could mix up pine resin with beeswax and charcoal over it's basically stone-age glue then this one over here this is oak we used fire to hollow it out so what we did was we put wet clay around the edges put a fire on there let it go down a little bit chipped away the charred area so it basically just made the work so much easier having seemingly simple projects turned a long drawn-out endeavors has kind of been a staple of mine so I want to nip this in the bud and get it done in the least amount of time possible so my plan is to build a conservatively small boat inspired by the Pesa canoe using the most efficient tool to shape it fire finding just the right tree was the biggest challenge something that is certainly more difficult today than it would have been ten thousand years ago after a few less an idea possibilities the best option we had was a dead pine on my brother's property in Duluth that had blown over several years ago so in our last video we prepped the tree by cutting it to size and stripping it of bark now to turn into the actual boat but first I den Alize do a small scale prototype canoe to test run our strategy and see if there are any tools or other things we might need to do first [Music] more catnip in here used to be your favorite place to be that's uh take all the Scopes ready [Music] that's too far to drop babe not leaking we decided it was going to jump let's go over what tools I've already made and have my disposal and what else I'll need at the need of copper axe native copper adds a stone axe although it's out of commission and some native copper wedges some additional wedges will likely be useful to split such a long log so we put together a few other options using pieces of antler and wood we also assembled a second adds using an antler piece as well now for the first step splitting off the top portion of the boat with no prior bolt making experience this process is going to be mostly learned through trial and error by trying to best match the known example of the Pesa canoe yeah but there are a few issues my log is unfortunately a few inches narrower than the peso canoe and as a modern human I'm considerably larger than what an average human would have been around ten thousand years ago but because I have no other options for a tree and likely to be working with some pretty thin margins here I need to rip this off it's already hollow full of ants they're ready for a voyage this is actually to meet things up a lot this nice pretty solid outside of it can't bring my digging stick down we're gonna tip this over [Music] don't break a boat so you got got oubli got a top rivet cut open found out like the part actually wanting to sit in is already pretty much hollow so now he's got a drag this out of the woods who ever gonna burn it and burn out the rest we were gonna burn er to size tried to cut it a bit long so he had extra in case this was too rotten so hopeful it's not too heavy and we can get it out to where we're gonna burn it [Music] you may have noticed the few extra them out and click the link below for 25% off alright so it took five of us voted over the haul this guy out of the woods and just clearing we can now start to burn it and actually end up being fairly rotten on the inside we've been clearing it out with the ads and other copper tools chipped out all of the rotten bits and I think it's actually gonna help us a lot because it's just on the inside and the outside still seems completely solid so it's probably saved us a good many hours of burning hopefully the outside holds up so far it looks pretty solid like we're going to start the fire move it into here but because some parts of it are really close to the desired width I'm going to take some of a clay and pack it around all the thin parts to protect it from the fire so that should allow us to kind of control the fire evenly so I can fit inside of it and hopefully float [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now we're entering about our eighth of the burn and we've made some pretty significant progress I'm on the third shift so far and we got most of the end burnt off pretty decent grooved on the whole thing so far so got a deep in a little bit and then why didn't it whatever I'm gonna sit right now it's pretty tight but hopefully you can expand a little bit now it comes a little bit more difficult part of making sure we don't burn too much burn holes in it it's already a few holes I can tell just from knots and stuff we'll have to patch but that shouldn't be an issue I think we're on track to finishing early actually those might be famous last words [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] lifted and turn [Music] so about 50/50 chance it's gonna float I think there's heartburn all right throw this piece we split off from the top of the canoe I'm going to chip it down and try make some sort of paddle out of it got a completed boat got patched up seems promising have been tested in water and now we're going to it's a little narrow I can't release it but I get Neil at Lake Superior a beautiful sunny day I haven't invented any navigational equipment yet it's too foggy to see the Sun or the stars so it can be going completely blind and alone so she'll be fine so the very least if this doesn't work as a canoe don't look as a coffin [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm gonna call this a partial success we made a boat it actually floats pretty good it has a couple small leaks that slowly takes on water but nothing you couldn't pay a lot as you're going and for a small child it works pretty good but for me it's uh kind of the biggest issue is just the shape of the tree and the overall size of it unfortunately had a very limited option of what we could find so this is the best way yet and it falls a little bit short we have a narrow point on one end and the spot we've burned a little too much on this end and it's kind of difficult to balance between the two without taking in a bunch of water and sinking but it holds a small child we can actually use it as boats unfortunately the combination of the narrower sides allowing me to sit lower in the boat my extra height has made the boat extra top-heavy and tip immediately when I tried to use it it's a very refreshing dip in the lake so in an upcoming video i'll be making further improvements to make it more seaworthy for someone of my size adding some outriggers for better stability as well as thinning the walls further so that it's lighter and rides higher in the water and some additional patching and sealing of the wood with pine pitch then i should hopefully be able to utilize this boat with another technology fishing so how much does it cost contain for all the labor including the initial cutting of the tree they took a total of 43 hours to make it but it also utilized all of the previous tools I made including the pottery which took 13 hours to make the native copper axe and adds which took 14 hours and the stone axe of 45 hours so to make this boat include making all the tools it took 115 hours or at minimum wage 920 dollars next up I'm making a bow with the other tree I cut down before so be sure to subscribe to see that figs again in Bell [Music] if you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe and check out other content we have covering a wide
