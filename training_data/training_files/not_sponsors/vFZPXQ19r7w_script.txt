hey y'all peeps here they all they all pizza here alright I can do this all day but we got to wrap this up at some point so one more chicken nuggets are good only when wet chicken nuggets are good only when wet it worked all right next item where did I put it hold on one second here this one's probably the one I was most excited to try the keepsake box by password journal I'm fairly familiar with the toy called the password journal it was a toy marketed towards girls with a voice-activated password so they could keep all their secrets hidden from their creepy brother waddling around in the background but I'm not sure I'm familiar with this particular version of the toy again called the keepsake box the keepsake box with voice-activated lock record your memories and protect your treasures memories and treasures sorry old reference you guys don't remember my eight-year-old reference you're not a true PPG bag let me know if you're a true PPG fan in the comments spot thirsty okay so you record your password record your memories and then use the matching sticker to label your keepsake I can read and playback to hear the memory of your keepsake okay I'm just gonna swear with you guys I honestly don't get this this children's toy is really confusing me let's watch the commercial on YouTube and maybe it'll help us figure it out check it out your own special place to keep your secret stuff [Applause] never keep sandbox cookin keeps a first this should've hired me for this commercial okay so I guess you put stuff in the box and then like record a memory yeah I guess I'm not sure if I really have anything worth hiding in there because I could put my nudes in them be right back gotta take some nudes we can solve this mystery we can figure out the toy made for ages 6 plus I believe in us get sake buzz could kick a keepsake a brother / brother brother this is a disclaimer for you - don't use be dangerous with knives or do anything that I do ever including talk oh it's really tucked in there good I need a parent and/or guardian to help me with this there we got it everyone it's okay mom you can go home I figured it out alright so here is our keepsake box it was kind of fun look at it we have a little box I don't know why I'm so excited for this this toy this six-year-old girl toy look at these keys look at these brother proof brother put this song it's just so catchy telling you you guys are gonna be singing that in your head later used to pee in the shower well I guess we need batteries for starters so let me let me go get some batteries to put in this ready for memories and treasures all right batteries are in now what do we do whoa [Music] nice let's do it again these are the stickers that they were talking about in the commercial that's how you mark your item with the key that you want your memory I don't really get it like what I don't really get the point of like recording your memories but hey whatever you like keep stuff in there and you keep your memories okay I didn't make it I'll have to defend this I try to talk about this too much this really is the worst it's the hardest part of that on YouTube you you get to do whatever you want but sometimes you get a mean comment I don't think I'm gonna put up with this anymore all right well I guess I have to find some stuff that not only represents a memory that I want to save for all eternity but also fits inside this box that's actually gonna be slightly difficult to do all right I got a good one for the first one we oh geez check out the first episode of goodwill garbage if you haven't seen it already we played with a bear toy it's a bear let's go ahead and just use one of these little balls of ammo it'll be a good one now I just have to figure out how to record the memory bangle a Adu dog we did it all right I didn't really match the song very well but we did record the password yeah we had a bearer and we shot it in the mouth and his everybody had a good time perfect lucky memory recorded you know was a good memory haha yeah that was a good memory so I think I want to remember that memory for a long time so I guess I can use a key that'll work - remember that memory I'm going to use one of the keys from this box so that kind of just knocks down two memories in one go one memory left for my final memory I'd like to include my most prized possession this doll that I found at the thrift store I'll keep you forever in my heart and in my box I will now play for you the exact moment I found my favorite new doll come with me please dolly
