the old chaos that devoured the once proud ivory king and the profane flame that lit the sky ablaze could these two flames be one and the same is not chaos itself profane in nature did the flame continue to burn on the same tract of land subjugating the people nearby and forcing its leaders to attempt to hide it from the world most notably the ivory king and lady alsana was it not the sisters of this silent oracle that triggered the curse of this flame sleep well and allow me to weave you a tale of both flame and curse the old chaos beneath the lame lois is an interesting mystery indeed and the more i looked into it the more of a conundrum it became it's certainly a reference to the flame of chaos but is it the flame of chaos or perhaps a different but similar flame altogether that was the question that i needed to answer first but the answer i've come up with is that i'm still not entirely sure and the handful of descriptions from armor sets and the ivory king's soul and weapons in dark souls 2 more often than not the sea in chaos is not capitalized when talking about the chaos the lois knights plunged into which is confusing because an unruly flame would be chaotic and plunging into it would be plunging into chaos but chaos with a capitalized sea would be more specific to the actual flame of chaos so you can now see my conundrum there not to mention the idea of the flame of chaos originated in izalith and how far can a flame really travel in questions of that nature so what i concluded was that what is known as the flame of chaos and the profaned flame could be synonymous profane is defined as something secular or non-religious which is exactly what the flame of chaos would be considered within the universe of dark souls the sins of izalith are brought up repeatedly and the twisted malformed creatures imposed upon the world from its flame are at least in the grand scheme of things unholy so perhaps it is its own piece of the flame of chaos distorted even further the ax eleonora reads a strange weapon found among malformed inhabitants of the profaned capital the profaned flame was triggered by the curse of these women relatives of a certain oracle but despite their culpability they went on living without any cares the only named oracle in dark souls is alsana and is who i think this description has to be talking about when manus was killed he was shattered into tiny pieces which would give birth to particular beings that inhabited manus emotions these shards would go on seeking power in ruin manipulating kings to their dark will and putting kingdoms to disarray alsana was for the most part the exception to her fragment sisters she was the manifestation of manus fear and latched on to the ivory king for the comfort his power brought her she would later realize that the king knew this and cared for her all the same so thus alsana sits and watch over the chaos that her king failed to defeat for her king quite the opposite that we see from her sisters so the profaned flame was triggered by the relatives of a certain oracle that oracle being elsana and the relatives being the other shards of manus even the enemy that drops the elenora axe was called the monstrosity of sin and it's a giant hand monster and manus literally is translated to mean hand and it was his giant weird hand that pulled the chosen undead into the past which inevitably spelled his demise the symbolism is all there but why would the shard of manas trigger this chaotic and profane flame i have a bit of an idea on that the ivory king ultra great sword reads it is said that the ivory king was once the highest ranking knight in his home of firosa famed for its god of war after taking his crown they say he was the first to swing his sword in times of need be it for his homeland or his people the feroza part is interesting because it's known for its god of war which we know to be the firstborn of lord quinn which probably means that elaine ruled by the former highest ranking knight of farosa likely would have sided with the tradition of linking the fire and extending its age the lame loys definitely has its connections to ferosa more so than just its king it's also intriguing to consider the description of the northwarder robes found within the frozen alaimose it reads verosans venerated the god of war and sages who led warriors into battle were called northwarders north orders earned their title only after completing a great journey of great hardship after which they would be worshipped as oracles of war gods now again alsana is the only named oracle we know of which isn't to say necessarily that she led the knights of voice into battle to earn this title perhaps being close to the king had its benefits and she earned the title in a different way but that isn't really important i draw from this that as time went on alsana was the one shard of manus who forsook her purpose in a way instead she cared for her king and her people again the opposite of the other shards and in doing so it seems stood behind the ideologies of loyce and feroza which is also the exact opposite of the darkness sought by the other shards now the reason i explain all this is because i think that is the reason the profane flame was triggered by osana's sisters because she found and or achieved what they didn't call it anger jealousy whatever but i think it was a vengeful act in spite of osana now that's all well and interesting but it doesn't quite draw all the parallels of the profaned flame and the old chaos being the same that would mean the profaned capital was built on the remains of the land voice and i think there may be some evidence of that the profaned capital certainly has its ties to dark souls 2 which we can start looking no further than the corpse of poor ladder smith gilligan [Music] then there's obviously eleonora which is in reference to the shards of manus the oni slayer grape oh which is the elan grapeo and if you buy into the idea that carla is also a shard of manus then she's just on the outskirts of the profaned capital in the irithyll dungeon there's even yorm the giant which i believe is the biggest tie-in to dark souls 2. his soul reads yorm is the descendant of an ancient conqueror but was asked by the very people once subjugated to lead them serving as both a weighty blade and a stone hard shield i believe the ancient conqueror yorm descended from to be the very giant lord who invaded and conquered drangleic in retaliation for vendrick stealing from the giants and enslaving them asked by the people once subjugated could be in reference to the fact that giants were slaves in trying lag but eventually the people needed yorm's strength and more specifically they needed it against the profaned flame perhaps because after the ivory king's demise the flame could be left unchecked and of course we know yorm tried to fight fire with fire as his syndras read cinders of the lord left by you armed the giant lonely yorn became a lord of cinder to put the profaned flame to rest knowing full well that those who spoke of him as a lord were quite insincere of course that didn't work out so well for the denizens around the flame but by now we of course know that being in proximity to any sort of named flame in dark souls is probably a bad idea the profaned flame pyromancy reads the profaned capital was consumed by fire after yorm the giant became a lord of cinder the fire born of the sky is said to have incinerated not but human flesh that is of course to be expected because we knew from the beginning that the flame itself was triggered by a curse so naturally things wouldn't have gone as expected we also know that the old chaos was down below the frozen township of el lois almost in the same manner that the profaned capital is down below the frozen township of irithyll a profaned great sword reads a ceremonial sword held in pontiff sullivan's right hand representing the profaned flame long ago when sullivan was yet a young sorcerer he discovered the profaned capital and an unfading flame below a distant tundra of the earth and a burning ambition took root within him an unending flame below a frozen landscape sounds exactly like a lame voice in fact a lot of things about the pontiff are kind of reminiscent of some of the traditions that came out of lamlois take for example sullivan being a sorcerer which could be in reference to the sorcerers we see in the profaned capital the court sorcerer robes read bro born by court sorcerers of the profaned capital the formal gold stitching suggests they may have also been oracles there are many sorcerers who claim to airship to the great sage big hat logan and the profaned capitol house is one of two leading schools now i'm not going to get started on how logan might be included in the profane capital or flame because it'd be a deep rabbit hole and i don't think it's particularly important to this theory it is interesting though at the idea that the court sorcerers could possibly be oracles as well which could allude back to the sages at a lame lois becoming oracles there also seems to be a similarity in designs between the lois knight armor set and sullivan's outrider knights as well as similarities between those who inhabit the two armors let's read the descriptions the charred lois armor reads these knights of lois plunged into the old chaos with their lord and lost their sense of self to this day they still burn in agony alongside their once proud king and the outrider knight armor reads these knights were given the eyes of the pontiff but the eyes transformed them into savage raving warriors who only knew how to serve as mindless guards so not exactly the same but the outcomes are similar losing your sense of self and mindlessly attacking but that of course isn't an uncommon theme in dark souls i do want to point out that the pontiff's use of eyes to constantly hound his knights is quite interesting especially considering elaine voice also placed importance on the eyes of their priestesses the eye of the priestess reads the eye of the first priestess who watched over the lame lois allows one to see the unseen all the great priestesses replaced one of their birth eyes with this returning it after their term was complete the tradition of using eyes to watch over certain aspects of their kingdom to help keep locked away the flame could be where sullivan derived his use of eyes within his own people finally let's take a look at the vessel shield its description reads shield depicting a priestess of a lame voice the priestesses who devoted themselves to appeasing the ancient flame are no longer now a reason they could be no longer is that a lame voice itself is no longer or their hearts were turned by the profaned flame but if you look at the shield itself the priest is watching over the flame inside some sort of goblet-like vessel or kind of what looks like its own lord vessel if you will not unlike what these seemingly priestesses are doing with a flame at the profaned capital i think all of these would-be coincidences between a lame lois and the profaned capital and earphil are too many to be nothing so stranger are you now prepared to plunge into chaos so so you
