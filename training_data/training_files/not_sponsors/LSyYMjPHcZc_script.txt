and her social network as well we're going to add i guess they're going to add some more people here too but what's really cool is you can see how pretty much maybe advanced really this website is and i really was able to set this up i only took it as my google cast crashes it will go ahead next sat out but i really only took me maybe an hour so to really set this all up very easily and that's really through the power of Squarespace and i want to show you how all that works so when you have a square space site and you want to edit and do things all you need to do is hit escape on your keyboard you're gonna have to login here which I'm going alright we've logged into the home Squarespace r square space website and login to the backend the admin panel where we get things done here and make the site look really really cool this is basically where you basically design and make the page you make your blog pages and all your entries and stuff pretty much within here before I show you that i want to show you basically what you first see when you set up Squarespace and that is over here and not in domains but in the templates section right here where you can install a template so when you first sign up for the squarespace the first thing is going to ask you to select a template and a lot of great templates to choose from a lot of high quality premium templates to choose from and when you click on one of them will choose this one here that looks all nice there and the momentum template it gives you an a mobile view and a live preview that you can check out to see how it's going to look you can also see custom websites using that as well too so you can see an example of what you can use which you can do with that template to really make it your own you can see some really really cool designs right here really nice you need to sit install and install it tough but we've already installed Avenue here and that's what we're going to use sort of as our base here so let's go ahead and jump back here into navigation and this is where we basically design the website here so how how do our designers pages simply so I just basically added a new gallery page to the home section here let's look look at BW one I needed to do a few things to configure it so the first thing I wanted to do was configure that thumbnail icon and I like to do is go into settings here and this is where you can change your navigation title of your page title and this is where i can add the thumb right here you can see right below really simple easy to use you at it and it's going to actually sort of when you upload it it's going to process it and it's going to make it sort of get figure and work well within it without you having to do too much in terms of photoshopping and editing and stuff like that you can still have to put up a pretty decent image but you're gonna it's gonna really put it in the right position for you to enough to do too much editing from there and this is the description here you can add to that but as you can see here I'm showing you and it looks like it's very simple I know some of you power users out the especially where / Caesars like am I so if you're looking at dislike well this is nice but it's like all sort of handheld and sort of done for you there it's almost a little too simple now you can still inject some code right in here so you can add some code towards you wanna do some more advanced things you're going to see that throughout the squarespace navigation here in the administration panel so you'll be able to do and add those things here to really customize any sort of make it your own so you do have the power user capabilities here within square space and you're gonna find out from talking to parties as I go through here Squarespace is really good for make little simple nice quick websites that are really sophisticated and when you need to make some advanced adjustments to it you can really add to it you like I said you can inject some code and do a feel that things with it and basically going back here to how I designed the page you can see how I design an icon then this is the page here I uploaded a picture really easy to have pictures all you have to do is hit to see these long lines here hit that plus you can see you can make it basic text markdown quote image gallery video audio in bed yet products amazon donations you can create a forum newsletter I think you kind of get the idea here you have a bunch of different sort of uh edits that you can add within here a tag cloud you can ask my social network in here just click on it and you work through the navigation men wizard it they kind of give you of it and kind of set it up that way it's really cool and you can actually edit the photos as well within here to see I just easily right click that and I can change the file name I can stretch it at a light box and add a caption to the bottom of it have an outbound link to when you click on it Adam I links down here below you can see the little nice little uh WYSIWYG editor right here to quotes you can add bullets and all those sort of things 4matic really simple just type right in with in there but it's pretty much a WYSIWYG editor for the most part really really right through your browser you don't really need to do too much and it has all the configurations right there so that's something that's really nice that I would say it's a little bit over WordPress where it's a little bit more on sort of Cody in a sense but it's a simple more press book you look over here here you really kind of get a nice sort of WYSIWYG covered almost a drag-and-drop easy click interface to really make the page it is simple know what you see here is putting with what the page is going to look like and I was able to do that on my page bored at work tech I smart buy some gadget guy glasses and glitter and yummy and his website as well to an elite cruise there and I can add a gallery page simply clicking on that and unless you know you can add a page gallery got a blog post if you want to an event product simply click on and it's gonna make you go through navigation of each one if want to add a new product you're gonna use delete it there and delete it off there he can add pages here that are not linked or not available yet on the are are not available yet here within the navigation you can put some down here as well too so that's simply really how I set to something I did this with in about an hour or so let's take a look some of the other power that you have you do have statistics that you can check out here and it gives you traffic mobile mobile user subscribers referrals popular content searches and queries detailed activity our daily weekly kind of gives you there but you do have the ability to add on your own dumb that stuff like let me see here and I know I saw it a little bit earlier you connect your own social networking accounts with it you can

been able to really go through the help section to be able to find what I need so i definitely recommend using that so another thing i want to show you here let's go into the preview here go back here now here at the bottom you can see here i can have to edit where you can edit content you have this little brush here now this brush here while you're on the page you're in style mode this mode actually allows you to change a few things like the site title it's like title color so if I wanted to change that to a different color I want to change it to men or reddish or something or a different code or does support an RGB codes or the hash codes within their I want to change my canvas background or something completely different as well too if I want to change that site background I want to change that up you know maybe I want it to be you know purple like that what a reason to not the greatest look there but you kind of get the ID kind of change it to whatever color you want
