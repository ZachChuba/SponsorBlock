this episode is sponsored by brilliant have you ever had a problem so hard you thought it was just impossible the chocolate fudge brownie or the Nutella cheesecake well luckily computer scientists have come up with a method for dealing with these it turns out the unlikely answer is to relax the story starts with the 16th President of the United States Abraham Lincoln before he was president he was a Prairie lawyer this was a lawyer who would travel from town to town arguing cases this meant he often needed to ride hundreds of miles every week he was a busy man and wanted to do this the most efficient way possible covering the least distance and not passing by any town twice so a natural question arose what was the shortest route he could take while making sure that all the towns were visited this is now known as the Traveling Salesman problem and it's one of the most famous unsolved problems in computer science so what makes it so hard I mean you could just write a computer program to crank out every single route possible and get it to return the shortest one as they say in France at viola but the thing is this is kind of the computational equivalent to throwing a deck of cards until they land in the right order it's going to take a serious amount of time a county with around 50 towns would take longer than the age of the universe as time wears on more and more computer scientists are starting to think we'll never have an answer to the Traveling Salesman problem so does that mean we should just give up and keep traveling longer routes than what we need to like peasants no computer scientists have come up with a technique that makes seemingly impossible problems possible the key is to relax seriously that's the technical name there are books called an introduction to relaxation techniques and discrete relaxation methods I feel sorry for the highly strung person who accidentally orders one of these things and is expecting pages of palm trees and cocktails and opens it to pages of this relaxation is the process of loosening some of the constraints of your problem then trying to solve it once you've made some headway at the constraints back so in the Traveling Salesman problem a way to relax would be to let Lincoln visit the same town twice and not make his backtracking footsteps count toward the distance of the route it's the same thing as finding the fewest miles of road needed to connect every town to at least one other town this is called a minimum spanning tree and for a computer to solve one of these takes pretty much no time at all okay that's cool but does it actually help us with our real-world problem I mean it's all well and good to solve it in Fantasyland but how much does it actually help LinkedIn well obviously doesn't help him now because you know he's dead well it's not the perfect solution we were going for it's still pretty useful for one we know that the minimum spanning tree can never be longer than the shortest route that Lincoln can take it's the shortest distance between towns and doesn't count the backtracking so any real-world solution that includes backtracking or takes a different route will either be as long or longer than this so we've at least found the lower bound to the real solution if we calculate a minimum spanning tree for Lincoln's circuit to be 100 kilometers we'll know for sure that the shortest route Lincoln can take will be no less than that then if we find a route that's 105 kilometers we'll know that we're at least within 5% of the shortest route so we can get a pretty good estimate of the real answer without even knowing what it is if you're willing to forego perfect and accept good enough seemingly impossible problems become a hell of a lot easier that's actually pretty good advice for life dear diary Jade you're not perfect but you're good enough approaches like these have allowed one of the hottest traveling salesman problems the shortest route around the earth while stopping it every city to be solved within 0.05 percent of the real solution computer scientists can actually calculate how good good enough is and usually it's a pretty sweet deal often an answer that's at least half as good takes around a quadrillion of the time not too bad when time is of the essence you know like when you're trapped in a burning building well that got dark fast city planners try to place fire stations so that all houses in the area can be reached within about five minutes obviously fire stations are costly business so we want the minimum amount of locations possible this like the Traveling Salesman problem still remains unsolved to this day the main issue is that we need a whole number for the solution the fire department can have one fire truck in the garage or two or three but not two and a half or pi of them this constraint of whole numbers is what makes this problem hairy but if we relax this whole whole number thing there are many solutions that exist this is a special kind of relaxation called continuous relaxation because we're idealizing our whole number world into that over the continuous world where any fraction or decimal can be a solution solutions to this relaxed problem could give us answers like there should be half a firetruck over there or two-thirds a fire truck over here but what happens when we transport ourselves back to the real world we can't really build half a fire truck well we can but that really raises more problems than it solves we could choose to round the answer to the nearest whole number for example one in two-thirds of a fire truck could be rounded to two fire trucks all we could treat it as a probability if you get an answer of half a truck just flip a coin heads means truck and tails means nutri this method gives an answer at least half as good as what the real solution would be relaxation isn't a magical tool that solves impossible problems but it gives pretty good alternatives in a fraction of the time it just goes to show you that even the most impossible problems the chocolate fudge brownie Nutella cheesecake become manageable if we can just learn to relax now what I'll have both there's no one there computer science and algorithms play a huge role in our day-to-day lives they can help with things like when to try a new restaurant or even how to find love I recently learned a great lesson from an algorithm about when to think list Adam link is on screen and in the description thanks for watching guys I hope this video can help you relax if you tend to stress out this video is based on a chapter of this book algorithms to live by by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths it's an excellent read I would 11 out of 10 recommend if you liked this videos made some other videos about algorithms that will improve your life which I've collected for you and linked at the end in a playlist so until next time bye [Music]
