how many wins will the Bengals have next year if they draft jobber oh okay so this year what do they have 1/2 inch one one win is the entire solution to two season two wins whatever it was one or two wins they got the first pick of the draft they're terrible sat out AJ Green basically the entire year first it was an injury and then nothing really happened and then now the conversation is about whether or not they're gonna bring AJ Green back ager greens gonna go somewhere else the statement of this office is that he's gonna get franchise time yes and they're gonna force him to stick around for at least a year and try it out now with a guy named Joe burrow I think much like most first-time quarterbacks that go to terrible teams now there's been some outliers right I mean Andrew Luck what he did with our koats team was a beautiful thing but a lot of people would say when he had Bruce Arians Reggie Wayne Andrew Luck and we had a great cast of humans in that locker room to have that success was something that Andrew had to win us a lot of games but it's not normal I think for a lot I think there's like kind of a slow progression rarely do you see somebody go in there and just light it up patrick mahomes I guess he sat behind Alex Smith his first year but he played is it's hard just to go in there and light up even Lamar Jackson had an incredible year last year whenever he came in for Joe Flacco but they still had a disappointing end of the season he had success but it was still not like yeah hey massive change so I would expect them to maybe win six seven games maybe five games I think five or six games I think they'll win with Joe burrow next year five or six games the Cincinnati Bengals will win next year I think they'll obviously get another high pick they'll figure out what to do with AJ Green now this is all acting as if they are a saying organization which the Cincinnati Bengals have not proven to be for a long time they still have an indoor practice facility in 2020 in may lives in Cincinnati Ohio whether it is quota is help it is very flat there are no Hills it is very breezy over there that is just something Carson Palmer nothing has changed from when Carson Palmer he literally threatened to retire because how terrible his life was they're ten now they haven't changed anything the food Carson Palmer even mentioned that the food was bad now they might have changed the in-house food but every single thing about the Cincinnati Bengals is an interesting one the Brown family I don't even know if they have a general manager they don't even think they have a general manager yes the owner acts like it the director of player personnel was on giving out quotes and statements about how we will not be trading the pick or we don't even know if we'll be trading the pick everyone talked about it's like you should know at this point hey you guys knew you're getting the first pick what week ten you guys knew you were getting the first pick week ten week eleven as soon as you saw that be flow and the Dolphins weren't getting the message from their front office that they were supposed to be losing and you guys were trying and losing I think all signs were pointing to the fact you guys remember that decision should have already been made but I guess they do want to keep it out there just in case Carolina Panthers or another team want to come with a boatload of options now is there anything that the Carolina Panthers could offer to the Cincinnati Bengals get that number one pick in my eyes well and get $20 off your first order from CT now back to the magic know in my eyes absolutely not because whenever you have a quarterback you have a franchise in Joey borough is Joey franchise in Ohio I mean he already raised $500,000 for Athens County with his Heisman speech he's a winner he's at g2 it's not like he's a nerd he's a guy I think Ohio people would love gritty tough he's from there it's something that is just a magical story set up but could they fall into the trap of okay we'll give you Cam Newton already established quarterback he's brand new too had a year off got a chance to get healthy we'll give you two first-round picks as well like if they come with that type of offer well if [Music] they do that they're dumb but if they keep Joe burrow and try to build that the right way and he becomes the face of franchise I think he wills that team to try a lot harder than they did this past year I think they went five six games yeah I mean I think they're at least gonna score if AJ Green's back and they have Tyler board Tyler Boyd and they have mr. four to John Ross Joe Joe Joe Mixon and by the way Joey Burrell has shown touch on deep balls which is something that if you haven't got it runs for two it's awesome but if you have a guy that they can take advantage of a guy that can run a for two even better that's why Patrick mountains doesn't get enough credit because although they have all those weapons and so I think there's a couple other quarterbacks that could do just as good as he does with him I think Aaron Rodgers would be able to shine in that cuz he's got a massive like I think you have to have a big arm with good touch to be in that offense because if he can deliver the goods to those fast guys it's not everybody can do that Meyler now everybody has a good deep ball I think Joe burrow has proven that he can take care of that Ross guy take advantage of that Ross guy and I think the bangle I think it went five six games next year and then they're like alright at least one more than one please remove in the right direction well they have more wins than a Browns next season that's a question that will answer probably later this week I don't think so man really so that's the fancy first year I don't know dude I have no idea what's gonna happen there
