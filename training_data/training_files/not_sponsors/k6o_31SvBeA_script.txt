hey there everybody it's Adam here from Tesla Australia welcome back to another video well today is a good day it is Sunday unfortunately the weather is absolutely rubbish right now it's a rainy it's foggy it's miserable it's pretty pretty chilly as well but it's a good day because we are able to get out of the house and I am heading along to the Tesla owners club meet so it's a bit of a kind of get out of the house celebration - I guess celebrate the success we've had of not getting rid of covert but but kind of getting it to a point where by a lot of the restrictions confuse which is uh which is pretty nice so we're doing a bit of a drive down in kind of southern areas of Sydney so I'm heading down to that right now it's just before 7:00 a.m. and I'm about halfway down the m1 motorway and I'm actually going to catch up with Tesla Tom from ludicrous feed in about half an hour for a bit of a coffee and then we are going to head to the meetup place to start the day which is going to be really good so I'm going to try and grab a bunch of footage from the day obviously pending weather how much we can how much we can kind of capture it outside the car and obviously with social distancing still in place etc least order to be somewhat cautious with that as well so really looking forward to what will be a good day so stay tuned and hopefully we'll get some some good footage and some good conversations with some of the people from the Tesla owners pub [Music] all right well we well on our way just caught up with Tom and Andy just for a quick coffee on the way down to the meeting point for the test owners Club of Australia and New South Wales meet but just one thing I wanted to jump in I wasn't going to shoot too much on the way down but one thing I've kind of noticed while while driving and being on autopilot is that the car isn't providing any type of indication above for the kind of the lane signs within the tunnels going under the Sydney Harbour so normally what I've seen in some other videos is the car sometimes reacts to the overhead lane signs I either the kind of green and kind of red markings at the top to indicate that they might be a bit of a phantom right there which is not good thankfully no one was that close behind me but it's not doing that so there's absolutely no recognition for those signs being traffic lights and in the cars kind of going along its merry way trying to try to kind of do its thing which is which is quite nice so yeah just what I would jump in now I know you dirty Tesla did highlight that in his last video that the car seems to have definitely improved when it comes to those overhead signs now his car was kind of stopping for those traffic lights or what was deemed as traffic lights on unkind of us motorway so it seems like definitely in in 2020 dots 2013 that they have definitely improved that which is which is quite nice [Music] all right well I am about halfway home now so I'm gonna end this video here I've just stopped in to Macquarie Center actually first time here supercharging and really good speeds are sitting at a hundred and twenty two kilowatts I only really need a about ten minutes here before I can head home so I hope you've enjoyed the footage today from the Tesla owners club meet it was a great day catching up with everyone and obviously really good catching up with the Phantom Lane four crew make sure those of you that watch my channel go head over to the Phantom lean for YouTube channel on Wednesday night we have a special guest which is going to be very exciting we're going to be talking to Simon Holmes a court and go through a bit of an interview and chat with him about all things I guess zero emissions and climate change and what we could all be doing to make this world a better place for us in future generations so that's going to be a lot of fun so as always thanks for watching really hope you did enjoy this video and if you did please give it a thumbs up and do consider subscribing if you haven't done so already and I look forward to chatting with you on my next video bye for now [Music]
