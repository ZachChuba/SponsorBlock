a MLB Hall of Fame voter proved to be an ass I didn't vote for Derek Jeter and although I do not tweet my aggression towards this anonymous human today I will go full sports media talk show host and talk about how that guy doesn't deserve a vote anymore if that guy can watch what Derek Jeter did throughout his entire career for the Yankees a guy that never once suffered a losing season in baseball for 20 years of baseball wearing the pinstripes properly yeah there was a lot of stories that came out that turned out to be false about him giving gift bags the various ladies that would come through his apartment over there and yeah there's other things that it was and he's a terrible owner for the Miami Month but whenever he was playing baseball he was the guy the captain whenever he retired the entire league gave him a salute that doesn't happen in anything anymore and a little kid with the hat with the respect tip of the cap I still use that as a gift and if you don't think that guy is a hall-of-famer and you're the only one out of 397 voters to say nope he doesn't deserve to be in there you know right you know what I think you deserve I think you deserve to never be allowed to write another word on paper or on the internet again oh these are mo be writers doing this voting you shouldn't even be a lot of vote now after saying like that I don't care he's getting into the Hall of Fame I think this is a big deal made of nothing that guy obviously stinks and it's anonymous so he didn't do it so everybody else knows that he did he did that specifically for himself to realize that and to tell his friends okay that was me by the way so for that I kind of respect I hate them I don't ever wanna be friends with them but for that you seeking now back to the magic Jeter's getting in that's good news somebody else is getting in that's good news Kurt Schilling not getting in Kurt Schilling I guess I just learned of this man in the last couple of days yesterday is my full baptism into the Curt Schilling world because somebody at ESPN said you need to get Curt Schilling on your show tomorrow and I said why they said well is gonna be incensed that he did not get into the Hall of Fame yet again and he will say something on your show and I was like well I don't I don't really think I know the guy then I started getting a bunch of articles I'm like I'm gonna having that guy on the show come on how about having that guy on the show no way he's a loose cannon man oh yeah big time and now I heard he's a great investor - one of the best he's one of the best investors of all time Rhode Island gave him 75 million dollars he dumped another 50 million into something he lost 125 million dollars on trying to create something it didn't happen but doesn't matter the dumb things or or the things that are polarizing that he said post Baseball it doesn't matter how terrible of a video game creator he is the fact that all his numbers are better than mostly everybody that's in yeah and he's not getting in is a wild scene that's why I always believe that these things are that are subjective there's too much power and too much weight put into these subjective things that people's feelings get attached to all pros Pro Bowls easting none of them matter mm-hmm but it's a nice little tip of the cap to the person if they get him for instance I want an award I didn't even know the award existed before I got it but when I got named that I won the award guess what I was pretty happy happy about it if I wonder what it would I have been mad nope but since I want it I'm excited I think that's what happens like that Drew Pearson video when he didn't get elected into the Hall of Fame like that was heartbreaking for me but I wish somebody would say to him hey drew look at this you got an incredible family around you it's supporting you you're on the old decade team of the seventies you had a hell of a career you got money you'll get in there eventually who cares I wish somebody would say that - drew drew obviously would like to be a part of that Kurt Schilling I guess obviously would like to be a part of Hall of Fame
