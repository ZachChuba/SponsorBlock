what tubing size should I buy well even though water-cooling legend Cathar addressed this once and for all over a decade ago it is still a topic of debate in pc and liquid cooling groups so we are going to find out [Music] learn more about PIAA in the link below so my answer to this question for the last six or seven years has been 3/8 inch ID so that's short for inner diameter 5/8 inch OD so that's for outer diameter and usually from primo chill in whatever color your heart desires there tubing's pretty good stuff and it's been my belief that any bigger than this will make no difference to your system temperatures however I do have to confess that I have never actually grabbed some big old thick cold tubing and tested this in a controlled experiment so it is time to change that first we're gonna need a few things Intel Extreme Edition 59 60 X check three different diameters of tubing check a triple 120 millimeter radiator check UK supremacy Evo CPU block check fittings check and check check and the optimal footwear for science extra check pose oh right the last thing we need this is a flow meter this will allow us to measure the flow rate of our different loops and a shout out to the guys over at performance pcs for sending this over to us on super short notice now as much as I love to spend my day building testing and tearing down various water cooling loops with different tubing sizes there is a reason that I hired writers so I'm gonna let Jake take care of that while I go do very important CEOs duce you put Stoops in there yeah no you put Stoops in there oh sure it said stuff before okay sure whatever ha ha joke's on me I guess because I still have to record this narration so then to keep our testing relevant the real world all of the loops were built into an actual case the fractal design define r5 so to establish a baseline we're starting with a typical configuration so we've got our pump going out to our CPU over to our radiator and then back to our pump which has a reservoir built into it the whole thing is running 3/8 inch ID 5/8 inch OD clear tubing from primo chill as for coolant we're just using plain Jane water which is going to be replaced for each one of our tests I mean I mean not because we would expect that new water would affect the results it's just because recapturing and reusing it would actually be very inconvenient that is how you fill a water cooling loop so to put a little bit of extra heat into our loop this will help to separate the performance between the different tubing sizes we're going to set it up to 4 gigahertz with 1.15 volts it's not like an impressive overclock for a 59 60 X but it should be stable and really that's all that we need for this kind of an experiment all right so let's get out of going stress FPU and bibbity Boppity we will be back in a while we ran each of our tests for a good chunk of time start a 15 minute timer and then we reset the statistics collecting them over a three minute window to get meaningful averages in between our 50% and 100% pump speed tests we allowed a grace period of 10 minutes with the fans on full blast to cool our water back to ambient after the first set was done the process was repeated with 12 millimeter inner diameter tubing and then 13 millimeter inner diameter okay so yeah okay how our results then well they're a little depressing they're all within margin of error and I didn't even get to use the flow meter because there's no way to get any results from the RPM that it reads no liters per gallon or liters per gallon liters per so it's just an RPM yeah it's just an RPM yeah so why it's just no difference yeah it's it's no difference what why are you going over there hey stay away from that what are you wait wait a minute wait what hey I knew it you weren't supposed to see that it's the workshop alright so you had your fun Jake so back in the early days of water cooling enthusiasts would often repurpose aquarium pumps which are optimized for flow rate and not head pressure so using wider diameter tubing could make a big difference but thanks to more pressure optimized pumps like the d5 and the DDC even if this might not seem intuitive even dropping down to like a ten millimeter diameter is a non-issue I mean even quarter-inch which the most basic all-in-one water coolers use should not affect the performance of a modern loop in any way other than the Bend radius of the tubing so in most cases it's far more important to consider other things like the restriction of your water blocks any tight bends the inclusion of restrictive fittings like quick connects but even in of this worst-case scenario which we actually built fairly recently the d5 didn't break a sweat so the final answer then what tubing do you buy well it's the good old same answer that we started out with any good quality tubing like primo chill or ek in ten millimeter inner that would be 3/8 inch or 16 millimeter outer diameter that's 5/8 inch for our Yankee friends and the thicker of the wall the kind of better because it'll help with any kinking in your bends if you don't want to use angled fittings like we've done on some of our builds private Internet access video description and get P ia either for yourself or as a gift so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome hit that like button now I get subscribed or check out the link to where to buy the stuff we featured in the video description also link down there's our merch storage has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join to get to get that out of here I liked it it's pretty nice actually you know what we should probably put it I should put this in Luke's off how about like right here like right there that's pretty cool right I don't know
