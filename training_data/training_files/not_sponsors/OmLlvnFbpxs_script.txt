[Applause] [Music] this video is brought to you by Squarespace it's been a long time since carol danvers first appeared in comic books in early 1968 and her journey to finally be in Captain Marvel wasn't always a smooth one constantly reworked reimagined and given different superhero identities Carol always seemed to be in the state of flux but the past 10 years or so have really brought some stability to the character and her characterization and it seems like Kelly sudoc onyx popular run on Captain Marvel will kind of serve as the inspiration behind the MC use new film [Music] so let's dig into the new trailer and the setting that it quickly establishes for itself the mid-90s the way that they conveyed this with Carol falling through a blockbuster was pretty smart and interesting to me like VW bugs for the 60s and disco balls for the 70s it seems like Blockbuster and kind of VHS nostalgia in general is kind of becoming the quick shorthand to communicate the 1990s and at least here is doing this job really well quickly giving viewers an idea of the time frame there and without ever having to really mention it then the narration kicks in and gives us a small peek into the movie's plot nothing too concrete really but definitely something to go off of and it looks like Carol not remembering her past is gonna play a huge role and I have to say I'm not totally sure how I feel about that to me at least it seems like there's both advantages and disadvantages so I'll start with the good stuff despite insisting that this movie is definitely not an origin story the whole memory loss angle allows the screenwriter to have their cake and eat it too a phrase that I've noticed I lean on way too much but I think it's true the movie will probably start with Carol already well-established as a hero but she'll also need all the backstory that the audience needs in order to make sense of it this is a smart way to catch non-comic readers up on the story while not having to spend a whole movie on you know power discovery montages which i think we've had plenty of in the last 15 years or so so that's really smart but it's a very tricky plot device to use too because here's the thing unless that's what the story is explicitly about like memento or the early born movies people with amnesia are kind of boring the lead of your movie should not be a blank slate unless there's a really really good reason for it so I'm really hoping that Captain Marvel either dispenses with the whole amnesia thing quickly or has found a very smart way to use it and of course we have to talk about the two big returning characters Phil Coulson and Nick Fury the MCU has been pretty content to just leave him alone over on agents of shield after his death in the Avengers and I get why reintroducing him in like age of Ultron would have brought that already overstuffed movie to a screeching halt as the characters who were so impacted by his death would have to have an entire season of TV kind of explain to them so it's much easier for them to just slap some more hair on the guy and put him in a prequel film as for Nick Fury I'm pretty impressed with the job they did with making Sam Jackson look younger I've always been frustrated that MCU Fury with the exception of Winter Soldier probably has never really gotten enough to do so I'm really excited to see him here too oh and of course we have to talk about the villains and this is where things get a little less clear it's really interesting to me that Ronan one of the weaker elements of guardians of the galaxy is making his return it could kind of be like if Malekith just popped up in Black Panther or something I really wasn't expecting it but of course given the fact that Captain Marvel is occupying more of that cosmic Marvel space it does make a little more sense it would be a really cool surprise if they were able to give Ronan a little more death and with Marvel getting increasingly better at crafting villains I wouldn't be surprised if they were able to the scrolls are also set to play a big part in the story and I'm honestly super excited about that for those of you who don't know these guys are a bunch of shape-shifting aliens at constant war with the Kree and I can't wait to see the MCU jump headfirst into all of that which I think from the old lady punching they kind of are I've always loved these guys don't get me wrong they've been involved in plenty of bad storylines in the past but a good scroll story is pretty tough to beat it's kind of like John Carpenter's The Thing but played out on a global scale they can be used to ratchet up the tension in paranoia really well and I hope they eventually find their way over to an Avengers movie as well because it can be a really good time when our heroes don't entirely trust each other I have no idea what they have planned for them here but I think it does look promising and I really hope this is just the beginning for the scrolls but what about Carol Danvers herself well obviously it's far too early to judge brie Larson's performance but I have pretty high expectations Larson has been great in comedic roles like her guest spots on community and some really dramatic ones like the painfully underappreciated short term 12 so I think Danvers is in pretty good hands the real question mark is the script which is obviously pretty hard to gauge the quality of from just a trailer but I've liked a lot of the screen ride past work so I'm not too worried about it [Music] at the end of the day though what I really want to see Captain Marvel do is balance two sides of the MCU that have always been a little bit separate cosmic Marvel represented by movies like Thor Ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy and the more grounded settings seen in the Winter Soldier and Civil War sure you can say that infinity war kind of already did this but that movie kept everything a little bit separate like it didn't have scenes with say rocket hanging out with cap and Falcon Captain Marvel will need to take a little bit of the espionage thriller a little bit of the weird sci-fi and of course a little bit of Top Gun and combine them all to make a movie that all feels of a peace with each other and that's probably hard to pull off but the MCU has had a lot more hits than misses in the past few years so I'm really looking forward to seeing them try it looks like Captain Marvel is going all in on mid 90s nostalgia and that should be a good time but if there's one thing I'm not in the pinned comment or video
