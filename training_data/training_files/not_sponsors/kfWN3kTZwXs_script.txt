as one of the only four percent who shows the magic gang relic i feel like it's my duty here to showcase how good magic really is we got the nightmare staff we got the sanguine nested staff and we are currently rank six magic in the game one thing i discovered in the last episode was that you can safe spot venenatis using the magic relic just i sprout from the distance so i feel like i want to do some kills here maybe get the dragon pickaxe for some points oh ho ho hello this is points dragon 2h for wielding this we're gonna get 100 points oh there we go the grind is over we got the dragon pickaxe i think this is more points um 100 points more nice so the ice barrage safe spot you can use it on vettian as well very simple very easy kills oh 100 dragon bones that's a great drop from the varian so callisto is actually the only wilderness boss i cannot kill using magic so i'll have to kill it with my newly upgraded melee gear this is going to be the first and the last callisto kill i do on league's 100 points obtained it is time to enter the nightmare once again there are three items we want the aldrich orb the harmonized orb and the volatile orb they all have different functions and based on what orb i do achieve and get as the first one i'll do different content based around the orb oh my another personal best 247 this team is great oh my god this needs to stop happening i keep dying here oh no don't you love it when the nightmare goes invincible and you can't click it oh my god stop going invincible happens so much lately oh i'm dirt eater got a duplicate nightmare stuff he already had that it's his third nightmares that hundred points for shaking in my hugging the tree and we got a level 82 farming that's 83 farming and that is 84 farming for farming levels for three mahogany trees i love the farm runs on leagues it's so quick look at that they're level 86 farming beautiful we're closing up on that 99. one of the major upgrades i need on the account is an imbued heart the imbued heart increases my magic level by ten percent which also increases my max hit by three or four and for this reason i will be camping slayer and superior monsters until i get one so i am currently rendering a video right now and we just hit 25 million slayer experience for 250 points and we still don't have an imbued heart no no no no no no not another eternal gem that's the same drop rate as the imbued heart oh is that another battle staff dust battle staff jesus christ so i've been juggling a lot of elite clue scroll we're gonna need seven to complete one and we have five steps we can do so i'm gonna take the chance here and start doing them right now yes that's our first elite clue casket beautiful yes all right let's let's open it right here no i don't want a chance of mimick 200 points and i accidentally clicked away and we got nothing used for a dragon maze which i can't even use no no i was afk no i just saw the gem eternal gem at the third one no worst thing is i went to poo and i lost three of my juggling elite clue scrolls oh oh oh my god yes it happened the dream the dream it's possible dreams are possible imbued heart baby let's go look at that our mage is boosted to 109 magic we are now 28.5 mil slayer experience and we finally got the imbued heart what a great upgrade to the account it's real time now to test out the imbued heart is it gonna work at the nightmare who knows welcome back unique item oh we got the mvp with the imbued heart baby it worked it actually worked that's 300 kill count for an mvp if it wasn't clear the person who gets the big bones gets the mvp oh newfou got an inquisitor maze that's a big item and he's amelia too look at the maze beautiful look at it look some okay changed weapon sad new feet got eldritch orb no i want that i want the dwarf no he just joined the mace and then he joined the orb something i haven't tested out yet is the max hit calculator with the dummy and let's see here what this sanguine staff hits there's a 35 and with the imbued heart we're gonna hit 38 so plus three max it on the combat dummy no why does this keep happening to me i banged for just one second and got an inquisitor's harbor well i do have that item and i don't need an item and this is going to be kill count 400 we haven't gotten a single drop since the helm and we get bones we didn't get mvp this time but we have gotten a lot of mvps that's 77 prayer all right this is going to be the last kill of today kill count 421 we did a session of 105 nightmare kills and if we look at the bones here we got 57 big bones meaning 57 mvps and 48 regular bones meaning we had a majority mvps at nightmare in teams of two to five so magic is actually very good i need some food to go back to nightmare so i decided to come to the rev caves for some manta rays solo crockett is down wait i know it's noted but that's an eight mil emblem what um okay let's uh grab our eight mil cash there we go 100 points as well all right we don't need any more money for a while thank you i'm currently using my amateur avarice this makes everything in the ref caves know that so i can stay here forever look at the man there is 50 of them flopper got an eldritch no no he got an eldritch i want the eldritch oh well congratulations flubber look at this gear he kind of deserves it look at him oh my god he got that inquisitor great help flubber got an another item what alpha got a pet what alpha got the bet while i was banking are you serious oh my god he got the back to back we got the back-to-back path into the inquisitor hell alfie no oh my god we gotta inquisitor plate skirt no way look at that that's full inquisitor wait here wait here wait here oh my god we got full inquisitor we got a bank we got a look at this we got full inquisitor 500 points that's a monster task oh my god and the inquisitor plate skirt is actually the best item i could have got besides the orbs because this is great for my gmail pking this was our original melee gear full obsidian with 109 melee strength with full inquisitor we get 112. that's not a big difference but is there a difference in the max hit max it with gmail 42 and with full inquisitor hello 45 that's three max hits so in theory it is possible for me to hit 225 only using my 5 gmail specs and if i stack it with a barrage 265 he's been ragging me all day all night secrets got an eldritch orb i've mystery orbs in the last hundred kills someone just got an inquisitor plate skirt oh no how could i miss it mil magic experience we're gonna log out so if we look at the high scores i'm currently rank nine i'm rank nine magic on leagues and this will never change in the high score and this my friends it's gonna be kill count 500. it was our mvp as well top guarana got an inquisitor helm as long as it's not the orb i'm happy oh smirty smurty gets an inquisitor's harbour no no no i missed it i missed the volatile orb iron that's the first volatile orb i've seen that's the one item we want and he just took it away from me no no no no no i got an item that's my first duplicate item and i already got this could have been a volatile warfare and this is going to be kill count 600 of this horrible nightmare i'm doing this grind for you guys so you don't have to do it yourself this is the worst boss ever good luck fella good luck mr ramon way inquisitive heartbreak first duo kill i don't want that item i already have this item too no way look at that inquisitor harbour he just started he doesn't even respond at all ramon just wants to loot this is going to be kill count number 652 this is a very special kill because if we re-log we're going to reload right now and update the nightmare high scores we're gonna see that we are currently rank one for the nightmare boss and still not a single orb almost 450 nightmare kills in this single episode and i'm slowly getting burned of doing the nightmare so i'm going to keep going and hopefully by the next episode i will have a volatile staff in my hands
