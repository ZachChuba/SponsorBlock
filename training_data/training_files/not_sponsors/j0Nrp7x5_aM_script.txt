the collection log it paves the way for my account progress as i work on one task at a time randomly generated by my spreadsheet now that we're in the heart here it's time to kick it up a notch with some of the hardest grinds we'll ever have to face this is generate task season 3. in the previous episode of generate task we managed to get the first skill gape on our account at the place where it all began as we hit 99 hit points after a short party we went back to finish our zora unique task where we got the serpentine visage next up was some afk castle wars for the first piece of white decorative after which we spooned the new champion scroll at the ghouls we then got a varick place card as our next unique from barrows and last but not least got the odium shard from the chaos fanatic after a bit of a dry streak today we're heading to water birth island to fight it out with the dagnold kings for one of their uniques sit back relax click the subscribe whatever reason that maybe haven't already and enjoy the episode all right there we go we just all all of the um well the main drops we got i guess all the split bark the ancient stuffs and the rings of life got us a nice little uh 1.3 mil there bit of money back that we spent on the rune arrows earlier not too bad let's gear up let's head out to the dks and i'm probably going to kill rex and prime that's the plan i think we're ready with our buddy here he's going to kill supreme i'm going to kill rex and prime in this gear this is the rex gear this is the prime gear and we'll see how it goes i hope it'll go well i'm not sure but uh we'll find out soon enough let's head out hm do we go for another rec skill as well i guess we may as well right framinic shield no what do you mean we've done 10 prime kills 11 wreck skills so far i'm definitely going to switch to blood spells though next trip i think that way we don't have to worry about our health and bringing food and whatnot we can just focus on the prayer pots i think that'll be much better but uh maybe we'll get it on this last rec skill who knows let's find out soon no luck on the final kill there let's get the hell out of here alright 12 rex kills 10 prime kills we're 22 kills in in total not too bad i suppose but definitely not the greatest trip let's switch to blood spells i still have to open these sinister keys as well but there's no rush there we'll do that eventually i guess oh my god my duo actually got an arches ring look at that we completed the task yes mud battle stuff oh my god oh my god i'm i'm not focusing well right now what's my teleport glory yes get out whoa 40 degrees 39 primes and that is all it takes that is all it takes for the mud battle stuff look at that yes oh my god what a day what a day we got the kale's fanatic unique and now we also have the mud battle stuff after about 80 kills in total degenerate prime and degenerate wrecks together about 80 kills in total 40 mud battle stuff not bad not too bad at all i don't know if we'll ever use this one at anything but i mean it's a nice item to have so you know what toss completed nice one we can move on to the next task so after only about 80 dragonate kings we've got our next unique which was the mud battle stuff let's quickly complete the task is that going to give us two yes that is going to bring us to 30 heart progress that is looking beautiful for the account we're closing in on one third of the heart here let's see what the next hard task is gonna be nah no there's no way no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no oh no i no the bride of fighters essence oh no we all know how many kills only trails had to do for uh for the bryo fighter's essence i'm pretty sure i have three mossy keys in the bank please if if there's one time that i can ask for an item that i can spoon on it's this one right here please let me spoon the brow fighters essence i don't want to go try on this one oh god here we go this might be a long one let's find out in order to get the brio essence as you may expect we have to defeat bryo fighter the moss giant test she can be found in her lair in the varrock sewers which requires a mossy ki to enter now this mossy key is obtained by killing most giants with a base drop rate of 1 in 150 however if you kill them in the wilderness the drop rate is increased to 1 in 60 and if you kill them on a mos giant slayer task that becomes 1 in 50. i'll be trying out both normal mod giants and the ones in willy to figure out what's the best way to grind out these keys now bravo fida herself also has the key on her drop table at 1 in 16 and the essence we're after is 1 in 118 a potentially very rough grind so let's dive right in so i guess we are ready to get started with this bryo grind i have three of these mossy keys in the bank so that is three kills straight away that we can try and get the essence hopefully spoon it because then we can just move on and don't have to worry about anything i've got the entire inventory set up for beginner clues as well because the plan is to do every guaranteed beginner clue that i get from bryo i don't think i'm going to do any beginner clues from most giants just to not break the rules too much but yeah i think i am going to do the one from bryo because otherwise people are gonna rage against me for not doing those so let's get started let's see how early we can get it let's hope we don't have to kill like 512 of them or something like that that would be insane all right i guess here we go together with toss man try let's see who gets lucky okay well that's easy enough cool first kill at bryophyta guys what do we get it's the rune square shield okay wait oh that's right i have a beginner clue in the bank okay let me do that one first bear with me okay there's the first beginner clue casket from the one that i had in the bank let's continue with the two barrio kills that we can still do let's see if we get lucky kill number two without any minion spawns for a rune plate skirt and the beginner clue this time we did get one all right the final kill where we don't have to grind for the key and we get some more roon i guess that means that after this beginner clue we're gonna start killing some moss giants i'll probably kill them in the catacombs of corinth stack up on some totem pieces and whatnot as well while not having to worry about picares in the wilderness because i don't really feel like re-gearing every time so this is where it begins we didn't quite spoon at the start with the three keys that we have unfortunately the pain begins let's hope that it doesn't take too long though but only time will tell all right i guess here we go now where do i kill these guys do i kill them over here so this where tri is currently standing the most giant grind begins we're currently 92 attack 95 strength 92 defense and well 99 hit points as well of course let's see how high these stats are gonna get hopefully not too high but only time will tell once again right we shall see there is the first mossy key drop from the most giants after uh 94 kills oh i didn't even notice i just got a champion scroll after 368 kills well there's uh there's the first one on this grind i think that is now the fifth champion scroll in total for giants on the account because we got a few on the ober grind as well i wonder how many we'll have at the end of this all right we got our third mossy key it almost took 600 kills so uh we're almost on the drop rate for four of them but that's not too bad it seems like we can get around two per hour here based on the drop rate from these mos giants so that's not too bad i will probably try the wilderness method as well at some point but for now i'm gonna do this let's go back to bryo though let's do three more kills i also got i also got two long bones two ancient shards and the one champions girl so far no totem pieces yet but that's all right let's go to bryo the sixth kill after the three keys from that trip and we get 100 nature runes okay no early essence so far how do i already have the second giant champion scroll after 770 moss giants i also just got a long bone like two kills ago uh we're gonna start a little collection here it seems i guess we'll take it okay i'm gonna switch it up and try out these moss giants in the wilderness i'm just gonna chop a canoe right here at the ferrox enclave go kill some moss giants we'll see how it goes i'm probably not gonna pray i'm just gonna eat up while killing the moss giants i think i'm gonna take quite some damage because i don't really have any gear on but we'll see how it goes uh the drop rate is much better in the wilderness so i feel like this might be a faster way to get as many keys as possible but i'll just do about two hours of this compared to the two hours i did at the catacombs i already know that i average about two keys per hour at the catacombs let's see how many i can average in the wilderness as well i guess this would be the annoying part of killing them in the wilderness you have shitty pickers to deal with that probably don't even kill you and if they do they get some bad loot but oh well he's wrecked by the most giant and i can simply log out so i just called it after about 40 minutes even less i think it was probably about 35 minutes that i uh did this trip i got two keys and one long bone and i even have over the drop rate of two keys so i think it's safe to say that i'll definitely be able to get a lot more keys in the wilderness so i think i'll be doing this most of the time instead of the catacombs i might switch things up a bit depending on if i'm streaming or not but i think doing the wilderness is definitely the way to go for most of the keys i just need to watch out to not pick up door stall seats because i noticed that if i have a torso seat it protects over the dragon defender and i don't really want to risk losing the dragon defender so i gotta watch out for that but other than that i think it's fine you know getting some food ready every single time we've been doing tasks recently gets us quite some cooking levels and there's another one 76 we're slowly on our way to level 80 cooking i guess but yeah there's level 76 just getting some more monkfish ready to head back out to the wilderness for some more mustangs i'm also going to use d-height instead of monk ropes now because i feel like i might as well i risked them anyways and i have plenty of sets i still have 20 died bodies 13 dei chips extra so don't really need to worry about those just going to bring those some extra defense is definitely going to help out there all right so we're ready for another 20 bryophyta at least because we have 20 keys in total from a bit of wilderness action we could of course get some keys from bryo herself as well but we'll see if that happens let's see if we spoon it straight away we'll do the beginner clues along the way again as well let's see if we get lucky boom first kill of the day kill count number eight steel bars marital seed what even is that who uses those not me there we go 100 nature runes that's a pretty decent drop i would say probably uh one of the better ones that are not the essence quick little kill for the essence on kill number 20 in total or we get the rune blade skirt that's okay we still have seven keys left right now still a chance died from the poison there three battle stuff so there's something we can use the essence on as soon as we have it one more brow kill for now this is going to be key number 20 that i stocked up let's see if this is going to be the one it's going to be kill count number 27. here we go could it be over already is this gonna be the one no it's not but we do get another mossy key so we have one more chance right at the end there i'll take that is it gonna be it or are we going back we are going back to the moss giants 28 kilogram is what we are at right now let's go and collect a bunch more keys after this final beginner clue and then we will come back alrighty we have another eight mossy keys collected and look at the renarcy it's stacking up 24 already we used some someone on the previous farming as well so even if we go dry on this it's not going to be too bad because we're going to get a lot of those and those are the ones that we need kill count 30 ruined platelets okay oh we killed her right as she spawned the minions the final kill of the day 36k wait the minions don't disappear what do you mean go away 36kc is what we end this day on not too bad we got like 29 kills i think today that is pretty solid if we can do that every single day which we won't be able to do but i think we'll get like 20 kills every day that means it's only about a week to get to the drop rate that means if we have to do like over 500 kills it will only take about a month instead of three months which uh some people like to spend at bryo okay for these beginner clues i'm going to build another portal chamber in my house right here so i have three more portals available i'm going to turn one of them into the centeston portal which is going to take us to the dig side and then the other one and then the second one i'm gonna make into a drainer manor portal because that's helping with a lot of beginner glue steps as well and then the third one i'll figure out eventually once i get to limestone bricks that i forgot to get for this centerpiece but i'll get the three portals done and that way we'll do the beginner clues a bit faster because of the two portals that i'm gonna make for now i also just realized that i still have an empty frame there which i can still use for a portal as well but i kinda wanna have the two beginner clue ones right here so i'm gonna direct the south one i'm actually not sure which one is which one two three maybe three is going to be cintiston two is going to be drainer manor so we have two these two gonna be super useful not sure what i'll do with this one yet but if i need another portal i have it right there and another one on the other side as well all right so another 19 attempts is what we're gonna start with today the keys were coming in nicely yesterday so uh we've got another decent chance of getting this essence let's get it going we started with 36kc today with these keys we'll get up to 55 unless we get another key from bryo of course we'll see first kill of the day we get some eddie played buddies as per usual kill count 40 already and our reward is a roon square shield okay kill count 50 for la runes i mean that's not a bad drop that's not a bad drop we're closing it on half the drop rate already which is not too bad the final kill for now once again we ran out of keys and we get a strawberry seed probably one of the worst drops right there we are getting very close to 96 strength though only 31 000 xp left so i think i might get that before i come back to bryo we'll see how much we get from the most giants but it's time to head back to the wilderness after this beginner clue to get some more mossy keys 56 though we're uh super close to half the drop right now and we're only a few days in so it's not too bad well there is our first curved bone on this grind after about 4 257 moss giants kill number 60 for coins we still have one key left right now one more chance before heading back to the wilderness for a bunch more keys we're over half the drop rate already now in just about three days so you know we're getting there really fast if you kill them in the wilderness not complaining but why they get attacked again they get attacked again and they get attacked again and now we log out and there is 96 strength coming in as well the first level on this grind 1 million xp until 97 and we're gonna get attacked by john mcdodger another challenger approaches and leaves straight away so we can continue killing them nice we'll probably get 93 attack and defense i think uh we'll see if we get any more levels after that i highly doubt it until we unless we go very very dry but i think at least attack should still uh be a level we get oh well there there it is there it is another giant champion scroll uh we're almost 5 000 kills in i guess uh 4 825 we already have three of these now on this grind i believe that is now number seven in total um yeah just growing the collection i guess we'll uh we'll take that well 100 kills later giant champion scroll number eight all right and there it is like i said 93 attack already that was faster than expected to be honest uh 93 defense is gonna be the next level and that's definitely happening as well another day another bryo to start it off we only have 12 keys now but that's still a decent amount to have a decent chance at the essence let's get going all right what do we get from the first kill of the day the rune blade skirt that's going straight on the cash pile this right here will be kill number 70 in total for some more runeite bars and we're gonna call it here at 73kc no essence unlucky not even on the magic number oh whatever man gretz on the black diat well i just died so i guess i'll just get a bunch of climbing boots from this guy because i only had one obviously i can very easily replace everything i lost so it's not that big of a deal it's just a bit of a time loss but it is what it is let's just get like five climbing boots so we are prepared for more deaths i'll also get some more rd capes and rada's blessings and then we're good to go again hey there's another mossy key that means that we can do 10 kills in total on the on this little section this right here is kill 80 for another rune skirt the rune skirts always come in we have three keys left right now three more chances at the essence oh my god no that's not the bryo essence no there is curveball number two on the grind 19 keys going to get us to 103 unless we get a few from bravo finals getting going again let's see if we get it this time there's a first kill beginner clue with a crimey termin the big 100 right here for another rune chain body okay we have three more keys left right now will it be 103 or will we have to go back to the will d let's find out soon enough well we're back to zero so we're going back to the willie soon there was 93 defense coming in at the mos giants we are now 1825 total and i'm pretty sure we just got 117 combat from that as well kill 110 without the essence all right just got done cooking all of the monkfish i had in the bank because i ran out of food we got 467 monk fish again so we're good to go i'm back up to 11 keys so that's gonna get us to 127 kills but i'm probably gonna get a few more tonight before getting started with the brow kills tomorrow so we'll see how many more i can get it's been a while giant champion scroll number five on this grind number nine in total first kill of the day we have 22 keys in total we get steel bars one more kill away from the drop rate the very next kill is gonna be it all right the drop rate is here and we get another mosi key that is something we might be able to get 140 kc then on this little grind with the keys that we have if we get one more 130 the final one 139 kc do we get another key for the 140 no we don't we got two rune bars and back to the moss giants we go and that right there is giant champion scroll number 10 that means we've had six in 8 848 moss giants now holy moly hey there it is the mossy key that is going to bring us to 150 kill counts beautiful throw a jig for good measure didn't work roon long sword on kill number 150 and that's gonna be it for today that is the last skill i can do right now it's time for more keys more mos giants we've already killed over 9000 but i think we're going to go up to that 10 000 mark now going for the next few keys we are ready once again 20 more keys and we've hit a few milestones yesterday as well well almost we got 101 renault seats we don't quite have a hundred long bones yet but we do have 99 in total together with seven curve bones and i've also killed ten thousand moss giants now on this grind so let's see if we finish on these counts or if we have to get more later but we got 20 more kills coming up this is going to get us to 170 kc at least let's get going go on then give it to me oh my god we actually have it yes second kill of the day baby brian as essence hey there it is there it is oh my god we're done we have 18 more keys in the bank for when we have to get some more beginner uniques but for now we are done with bryo thank god that only took a week we grinded it out it took 152 kills but we got it done baby let's [ __ ] go oh boy let's finish this beginning clue let's move on to the next task nice and there it is we also made some progress towards the big nuclear uniques because we have 152 caskets from those bridal kills so as soon as we get the beginner clue unique task we'll be able to open all of those and hopefully get a few at least but first let's slap this essence onto a battle stuff because we have to do that right let's grab one of these 759 that we have out of the bank let's use that on the battle stuff oh look at that yes burn charge let me put one nature rune in that do i get to choose how many oh well i guess it has a thousand charges now that's all right look at that oh yeah beautiful that one is sorted for the most clues as well later nice well i guess uh it's time to move on what if we get beginner clue uniques now that'll be that would be interesting wouldn't it let's find out and there you have it after just about a week of moss giants and bryophyta we have managed to obtain the essence that wasn't too bad at all honestly i don't see why you would spend three months doing this because i mean you can just get it in one week so let's complete it right there still gonna leave us at 30 heart let's find out what the next task is gonna be here we go please no castlevars or trouble brewing i don't want any of those oh my god oh [ __ ] the gauntlet oh my oh now that's a lot of stuff that we have to do because we have to do song of the elves now and then we have to learn the gauntlet oh [ __ ] i have never done song of the elves in my life i have never even tried i mean that's a good task though i'm happy with that because i wanted to unlock private sometime early the thing is i don't have a trident so we we don't have that available for uh saren but i guess i can do like blood spells that's probably gonna be the way to go right but i'll figure that out when we get there let's do a bit of questing and then let's do the gauntlet afterwards oh [ __ ] now this is once again going to be quite a big task unlocking the city of prividness and attempting an interesting activity i've never done before subscribe so you don't miss out on this in the next episode and i'll talk to you all soon in the next video have a good one and take care you
