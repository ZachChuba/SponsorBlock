wassup  you beautiful bastards. Hope even a fantastic Thursday welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show and let's just jump into and the first thing we're talking about today is the latest edition of Massive online creator at the center of international controversy news that person we're talking about today is PewDiePie I mean this thing blew up everywhere. It was on the BBC and the reason there was such a big reaction Is Felix posted this demi? Lovato me frame by frame? We see mom. Can you give me money for burger to buy burgers? Yes, actually buys heroin like a boss and immediately. You saw people pushing back against this Jimmy Wang tweet. Come on, bro This is making light of something that a lot of humanity struggles with day in and day out and countless families have been torn apart By an offensive humour for the sake of offensiveness isn't edgy It's just lazy and destructive some simply comment saying that it wasn't funny We also saw some fans commenting on the fact. They've supported him previously through scandal after skin tone He was a writing come on Felix. We've stayed with you through a lot Don't make a joke out of someone struggling with such a terrible addiction. She's been fighting this for literal years She went to rehab for this. This is not an OK joke to make there is no ok. Joke to make about this Of course at the same time you had people supporting one saying dark humor is like food, not everyone gets it I'm seemingly arguing that Felix is Unfairly villainize when users are tweeting literally anyone except PewDiePie could have posted that and it would have been fine Y'all just loved living at that man's through as far as Felix's reaction to the online reaction He ended up deleting the tweet and posted lead of meme I didn't mean anything with it and I didn't fully know about the situation. I realize now it was insensitive Sorry, as far as that response was Felix actually ignorant to what was happening with Demi Lovato. It's possible at the very least It's important to note that it doesn't appear that he made the meme himself. It was on other websites It seems like he was just hosting another one He also has a show that's dedicated to memes and we've seen people saying well because he has that show obviously he is Actually aware of the situation whereas others said no It just means that he's sharing this thing that was gaining traction Arguing that that doesn't prove anything and that's really all there is to this story I've seen people throwing out the hashtag PewDiePie who's over party my response to that hashtag is no obviously part of my reaction is based off of past Controversies with Felix and how he was able to survive and not only survive but thrive past though in those situations were arguably more offensive and fueled by a lot of coverage, but also I have that reaction because just if you look at stories in general cancel culture 99% of the time failed. I think there's a mixed reason for that There are some people that go, you know what human beings are flawed individuals. Sometimes they're they're not going to be perfect for me They're gonna do wrong I should be open to that and then of course There's the blind love and support that does not falter even in the most extreme of situations that we see with once again Not on the same level in any way, you know like with extreme situations like with a Bill Cosby But ultimately where I land with a story is it isn't me saying? I'm outraged or offended by Felix posting this meme or I want something bad now to happen I mean as far as that memes last joke is concerned it looks like the whole intent is just to troll people to trigger people and it now has very much done that but where I Smile and with this story is more of a question about myself and in Society and hopefully by talking about the world every day. We find out more about people and fuss ourselves as well I end up thinking would I have a different reaction to this story if I replaced Felix with someone else? right
Whether it be this situation or past ones and I won't include the Nazi stuff since I feel like Felix was wildly misrepresented there right
But what if for Felix's? n-word controversy when he when he referred to someone as the n-word while he would stream what if that had been let's say Logan Paul, what if this situation had been Logan Paul or Jake Paul? Would I have a much different reaction to that? Would you have a much different reaction to that and also with some of the people going in on Felix right now? Presumably some of those are Logan Paul fans Would they have a completely different tune if it was Logan at the center of this story? and so the question I want to pass off to you where I want to end this story is What are your thoughts on them? Do you think you would react the same or different and also? People in general you break it down to the nuts and bolts Do you feel like most people are just playing for teams? I lovea know your thoughts on this one Then let's talk about Facebook because yesterday they lost nearly 130 billion in market value in two hours and then is Facebook's steepest stock decline ever and just to kind of put this into Context for you because for a lot of people when you start talking about number is this large you might as well be saying but Jillian there's what Do you compare it to Oh for comparison's sake the 130 billion dollars that by itself The loss is more than three times the value of Ford Motor Company and Zuckerberg himself lost sixteen point eight billion in value He dropped from the third richest person in the world to these six So of course thoughts and prayers to Mark Zuckerberg in these trying of times I don't know if he's gonna be able to pull through. He said sarcastically so the question becomes why why did this happen? I mean, there's been Facebook controversy after Facebook controversy. Why now? Well, the massive drop came after a disappointing earnings report and comments made by Facebook's chief financial officer analyst I projected Facebook be bringing in thirteen point three billion dollars this quarter But unfortunately for Facebook they missed that mark getting in just and it's so weird to say just thirteen point two billion So they fall short by 0.1 billion, which doesn't sound like a big number doesn't sound like a big deal But it is important to know that this is the first time they've missed analysts revenue projection since 2015 So you at that situation? plus CFO David winner said sales growth would continue to slow down through the rest of the year and Facebook also fell short of analysts projection That they would hit one point four nine billion daily active users instead Facebook had Justin once again Just as a weird word to say one point four seven billion daily active users last month It's important to point out that a lot of this is just based on them not hitting projections The story here is not that Facebook is not growing In fact just from last year daily active user growth jumped 11 percent the story is that they missed projections and I think a lot of people are worried that that is going to be a Continued trend because of all of the past scandals and controversy and moving forward. I think Facebook is going to be fine There is an interesting angle to all of this and that angle and I think the thing that should be pointed out is that for? Some reason despite all of the Facebook controversy Instagram has been largely Untargeted which is interesting considering Facebook owns Instagram. And as far as Facebook's long-term success Instagram seems to be a winner for them You might remember back in 2012 Facebook bought Instagram for the low low price of 1 billion dollars and I say low low price because just earlier this month analysts said that if Instagram was their own company It would be valued at 100 billion dollars Also reportedly Instagram ad revenue is four times more than Facebook's for the year this despite Instagram having less monthly users on Facebook Instagram has around 1 billion where Facebook has around 2 billion and Instagram is just gaining ground right now Which is fantastic news for Facebook when one of your main competitors is another thing that you owns like if Google also owned twitch and they were like Oh, no twitch is gaining so much ground how Horrible that said as far as the success and failures with Facebook or really any other social media company right now Rhonda's gonna have to kind of wait and see but from that I want to share some stuff I loved today and today in awesome Bopha and you'll get 20% off then we got a trailer for to all the boys I've loved before your 10 out giving us How can you change someone's mind got a trailer for season 3 of animals? Which is one of the weirdest shows I've ever watched it got Wiz Khalifa on hot one weird life noggin asking How small are you compared to the galaxy then we had Thrillist giving us ramen pizza Is it actually pizza? And if you want to see the full versions of everything I'll just share the secret link of the day anything and all links as always are in the description down below Let's talk about all this junk we've seen over the past day about impeachment and there of course in the past been moments where you saw Democrats talking about impeaching the President but who we're talking about today? It's not the president yesterday We saw that 11 House Republicans filed articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that of course notable because Rosenstein is overseeing the Russia investigation since Jeff Sessions were accused himself As far as the lawmakers leading this move you had freedom caucus leader congressman mark meadows of, North Carolina You also had congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio They've been threatening to file these impeachment articles for a month claiming residency in both mishandled the 2016 election Investigations and that he is withholding documents from Congress in a statements meadows saying rod Rosenstein has been in charge of the Department of Justice as the agency has made every effort to obstruct a legitimate attempts of congressional oversight the stonewalling over this last year has been just as bad or worse than under the Obama administration for nine months we've warned them consequences. We're coming and for nine months We've heard the same excuses backed up by the same unacceptable conduct time is up, and the consequences are here It's time to find a new Deputy Attorney General who is serious about accountability and transparency And as far as why now? this move is coming after the Department of Justice publicly released a heavily redacted version of the Carter page warrant this weekend and kind of As a quick TLDR carter page as a former trump campaign advisor central figure in the russia investigation the FBI believes a page was targeted by russians to undermine the 2016 presidential election by house republicans saying with the FBI abused its power and misled judges when applying for surveillance applications of page as far As the articles of impeachment there are five and I would jump into them But one of the largest updates to this story is they are no longer trying to impeach Rosenstein which makes sense because one had already appeared like it would be a long shot Republicans like Paul Ryan have said they do not Want to impede the Russia? Investigation I mentioned him specifically because he also issued a statement today saying he doesn't believe Rosenstein Zach shion's warrant Impeachment saying I don't think we should be cavalier with this process or this term number two I don't think this rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors Which is a really high standard and so now congressman mark Meadows is tabling the pursuit of impeachment But instead now he wants to pursue Contempt if the DOJ doesn't turn over documents as far as why meadow has changed his mind He said he spoke with Republican leaders this including chair of the House Judiciary Committee Bob goodlet and meadows telling reporters I hope we can avoid impeachment and hopefully avoid contempt and get the Documents but certainly both those things are on the table and remain on the table to have more of a contempt process both options remain there also another reason I mentioned Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is you know Jim Jordan the congressman from Ohio that helped lead this whole thing according to reports in the midst of all of this jordan has sent A letter to his colleagues announcing that he is officially running to replace Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House which I mean we already knew that Paul Ryan was retired But it'll be interesting to see which way Trump goes in which way all Republicans go because Paul Ryan has already endorsed Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and he's also believed to be a favorite with Trump so is the move today in some sort of way a Showing of faith a showing of what kind of Speaker of the House he could be For Trump moving forward also as far as Jeff Sessions take here It appears that he has standing by his man my deputy rod Rosen. Stein is highly capable I have the highest confidence center And then adding what I would like Congress to do is to focus on some of the legal challenges that are out There you need Congress to deal with the immigration question for now that is where we are and it will be interesting to see going Into the midterms. Does this escalate does it go away? Also once Paul Ryan is no longer Speaker of the House once we see What the shuffling in the House of Representatives ends up looking like what happens from there? It's not how everything shakes out Do we see this reimagine? let's talk about the news and Reports of the White House banning a reporter for the questions that she was asking and it's been really interesting to watch the different Reactions to this but we'll start off at the top yesterday at an oval office photo op a CNN reporter by the name of Caitlin Collins asked Trump a series of questions about Cohen the tapes and Which if you don't know about the tape the Michael Cohen situation essentially the TLDR Tuesday night There was a recording released of Michael Cohen and Trump discussing what appeared to be a payment for the Karen McDougal story back in September Of 2016 also the rights to her story of an alleged affair. She had with Donald Trump in 2006 to America Media Inc The parent company of the National Enquirer and that small bit of audio is just a little audio from one tape That is one of many tapes that were taken by the FBI from Cohen's office and residence And as far as the heart with Putin Trump, of course invited Putin to the White House in the fall But before Rajat except in the meeting, it was suspended until 2019 and as far as the moment in question we have video that shows Collins asking the questions of the president who was looking away from her while people are trying to get the Press out of the room And here it's being reported that Colin was representing five networks at the time Porter is also saying that it is incredibly common for reporters To ask questions during events like that Colin's adding later those questions were questions any reporter would have asked and I was there to represent all of the networks and therefore asked about the questions of the day and internally They call that question portion a pool spray and during sprays its standard practice for reporters to ask questions now following those questions from Colin She says she was later called in to a meeting with deputy chief of staff for Communications bill shine and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and shines involvement here is notable because he just started working at the White House earlier this month and he's a former Fox News executive that was pushed out for his handling of sexual harassment scandals and here Colin says that The two told her that the question she had asked were Inappropriate and that she would not be allowed to attend an open press event later in the day having other CNN reporters would be allowed to go the event But you cannot and this resulted in CNN releasing a statement on the incident saying today CNN White House Correspondent Caitlin Collins was denied access to cover an open press event at the White House adding that she was told her questions were Inappropriate they were not adding just because the White House is uncomfortable with a question regarding the news of the day doesn't mean the question Isn't relevant and shouldn't be asked its decision to bar A member of the press is retaliatory in nature and not indicative of an open and free Press we demand better on the other side of this you had press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying at the conclusion of a press event in the Oval Office a reporter shouted questions and refused to leave despite repeatedly being asked to do so subsequently our staff informed her she Was not welcome to participate in the next event but made clear that any other journalist from her network could attend She said it didn't matter to her because she hadn't planned to be there. Anyway be clear We support a free press and ask that everyone be respectful of the presidency and guests at the White House and this morning Shyne Objected to the use of the word banned regarding the coverage of this event Like I said the response to all of this was very interesting because yes You did see some of what you expected people like Peter Baker chief White House correspondent for the New York Times to eating outrageous of the White House to bar CNN reporter Caitlin Collins from an open press event because I Did not like her question a strong leader does not fear questions a strong democracy does not shield its leader from those who question Authority Hallie Jackson chief White House correspondent for NBC News calling it inexcusable Unacceptable and sets an extremely dangerous precedent adding we shout questions at the president regularly. It's called doing our job adding I stand firmly with her but in a big move a show of unity We saw Fox News president Jay Wallace saying in a statement we stand in strong Solidarity with CNN for the right to full access for our journalists as part of a free Unfettered press Fox and it was his chief political Anchor Brett Baier saying as a member of the White House Press pool Fox stands firmly with CNN on this issue of access and on top of that He was also defending Collins on Twitter in response to people although it is important to note that the support was not Universal with Lou Dobbs on Fox Business saying this I guess my question would be who the hell are you? Alright, the president does insist on respect. All I have to say about that is it's about time there were consequences For disrespectful behavior in the White House based over the connection Dobbs has with Donald Trump. There were a lot of people going ok Well, that's not too surprising but also resulted in people saying that Dobbs is a hypocrite who's playing for Team noting that back in 2012 when Obama was president after The Obama White House criticized Neal Monroe from the Daily Caller this for shouting out questions at an event following that instance Lou Dobbs said I don't know if you had the opportunity to go on Twitter and listen to the collection of all the people going It's against the decorum of the White House, and it's rude to the president adding what's rude is the president not speaking to the American people and taking the questions of the White House press so as far as if Lou Dobbs is being a hypocrite a team player here or if maybe his opinion has evolved I'll leave that up to you as a viewer as far as where I land on this, of course It is incredibly concerning if the White House is going to bar a reporter for asking questions You could argue that they barred a person not a network. So it's not a ban. It's not Censorship but it was a ban on an individual that was working for a network that was banned Seemingly at least in part the question she was asking and the actions that many other Reporters also do but were not banned It ends up looking like the White House trying to send a message to other reporters And that is also why I appreciate it Greatly that the president of Fox News spoke out about this But that said that's my personal take away from it and whether you agree or disagree I would love to know your take about this story in the comments down below. That's what I'm going to end Today's show and of course remember, this is a PDS. It's not just a show.
