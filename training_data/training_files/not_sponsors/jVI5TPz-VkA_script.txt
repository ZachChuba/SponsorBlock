subscription at the end of the video in my last video I paid a visit to the Minneapolis Institute of Art for some background in history on historical methods of making paint produced an initial trial of tempera paint myself it made the paintbrushes I'll eventually need for my painting now I'm going to produce a variety of pigments some source naturally and some produce chemically Muse them to produce all of my own oil paints and then try them out myself but first I got a little more information from read up on some historical suggestions of how to produce paints we talk about how oil paint is actually made well paint these days is very complicated so basically you have your pigment and drying oil traditionally three types of drying oils were most commonly used linseed oil poppy seed oil and walnut oil they all have different properties today in modern paint manufacturer there are many more things added to paint there's dryers dilute ins a lot of it is not known to us and can't buy the manufacturer this was mostly the longer working time the made oil paint become more popular than tempera that was a big part of it if you think about oil paint you can create different surfaces you can create more texture it can be more sickly applied you can work with into wet you can change your composition you can work on top of your composition so with oil paintings we see a lot of artist changes for example in the paintings themselves here everything has to be thought out and designed beforehand just because you don't have that kind of flexibility we're now in the 17th century and this is a really good example of the handling of oil paint differs from that of tempera paint of your famous painting by Rembrandt real highlight of our collection but if you look closely you can see how thick the paint layers are he is applying it with a brush maybe stiffer brushes or almost like a palette knife so he's layering yet to create this beautiful beautiful texture so he's able to rework the composition again and again and again and add to it I pressed a variety of different plant oils so far but linseed oil tend to be the most popular of them because of its faster drying time I grew my own flax last year and previously used some of the linseed oil from it as a wood finish now I can also use that as a base for my paint now I just need some pigments some of them kind of cheaper materials available were different earth colors a lot of Browns kind of greenish tones those would be probably painted with earth colors first up some earth tones one Arizona a few years ago I collected some of its iconic red soil it's simple strained and wash and I should have a decent red ochre pigment for yellow I dug around and from the yellowest local soil like good interesting go ahead and then also strained and washed [Applause] then while in England the spring I sneak a few loose chunks of white chalk from the iconic Cliffs of Dover which I should be on the crush up to make a nice white pigment lastly for black a collected lamp suit produced from burning oil lamp yielding the common pigment lamp black now to make some more difficult pigments the pigments came from naturally occurring minerals and ores such as this one so here we have an example of malachite and here we have an example of a sure right early Italian Renaissance artists had a very limited palette so there's only a few pigments that could use for blue colors for example as right as well as ultramarine and ultramarine was a real expensive pigment it was made from lapis lazuli which is a semi-precious stone ultramarine actually means from across the sea so it came from far away and was very expensive so here for example the blue robe of the Virgin is probably as right I have been able to collect malachite or lapis lazuli however I have collected the necessary ingredients to synthetically reproduce them we'll start with ultramarine which I've previously spent a large amount of time trying to reproduce taking over sixteen attempts which ended up yielding only a few small pieces of it but now I've been able to upgrade to much better tools and have a bit more experience with the chemistry so let's try and make a big batch [Music] [Music] after making the kiln and the leftover sulfur can be burned off but just exposing it to the air then I'll strain down to the large chunks and then wash the compound yielding a really nice dark blue color [Music] next up for a green pigment compound often involved in that is copper and previously I collected some copper ore this is chrysocolla which has a nice green color it's not as green as other pure ores such as malachite which was rose really hoping to get however from this you can actually turn it into the same chemical as al kite which is what I'm going to do and when I previously extracted copper from this I went through half the process for that already which is dissolving the ore in sulfuric acid so how that solution here bunch of impurities are all in this solution Baja blast for later but at the bottom it started to crystallize that should be relatively pure copper sulfate so I'm going to scrape off those crystals dissolve it into some water and then react it with soda ash and that will produce copper carbonate which is the same compound as malachite and makes a pretty decent pigment [Applause] [Music] [Music] weird it's turning green but in the camera it's blue and it's very faint [Music] yeah here's the end result basic copper carbonate which is the same compound as malachite although there is a very noticeable difference in color so there's some explanation for that that I do not know now with six different pigments I just need to mix them together and the linseed oil but first a word from our sponsor I have my niece for your chance to win a free subscription with the oil and now six different pigments I should have everything for my paints I dried and ran the green and blue pigments through some ball mills to break them up into a finer powder and just even the copper carbonate change color fairly significantly as a dried so I have popped my basic copper carbonate ultramarine red ochre and yellow ochre I'm just gonna mix it in with some linseed or flax seed oil and make some paints [Music] [Music] [Music] the dirt tourists [Music] [Music] and done six different paints all set ready for the next masterpiece got some little tubes for you guys too we're gonna split these colors between all of our patrons at $75 or more so we're on a full pallet you'll have to connect with each other now with everything together it's time to channel my inner Bob Ross and make my old masterpiece hello I'm Andy certainly glad you could join us today it's a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever you are you ready to make a fantastic little painting this is your first time with us let me extend a personal invitation for you to drag out your paints and paint along with us [Music] happy [Music] it's gonna be fun [Music] early fall [Music] it's gonna beat the devil out of it this is the fun part we make a makeshift how to brush out left it would [Music] just turn that mountain a happy little accident Dan they're always happy little accidents all right so I'm starting to lose my patience and painting supposed to be fun if you aren't having fun why are you doing it so I'm gonna stop now with a little challenging I don't know if it's the paint or the paint brushes or the artist probably the artist but yeah that's all right I'm gonna call it dog lastly for some expert assessment I had Bob and Rita give me their opinion on my paints so I have my completed paintbrushes and six different paints that I made since I've put them in the two of the consistency has changed so are pretty set cattle what did you mix it with basically just linseed oil very nice that's a good white well that's nice that's it it's a nice are you sure it's ultramarine are we gonna make happy trees okay I like I like this one this one looks good that one looks supple this is a little grainy but you know some people might be into that this is clumping a bit but maybe if you add a friend you give it an assist you're making like a painting painting this is nice it's uh it's got a little bit of that grit the green head well this is a beautiful one that's really nice pencils fault mm-hmm looks like a fine mustard Cities then this is the part where your audience watches the paint dry I don't know what that is what what was the green what did she use basic copper company yeah there's something really funny about how it is that so how would you account for that is it that the oil yeah totally get out your microscope yes we should maybe it was indeed you grinded yourself it wasn't finely ground maybe it I think the white and and then this I love this smile really well this the consistency and the intensity of them are both really nice this one's a little liquidy but if it was mixed with something else then it's a beautiful color actually this one I'm not so sure about it's not really holding together should we see how this aegis see you know what in five years from now bring your painting in and we'll take a look big you Jamia and Mac for helping me put this masterpiece together and thank you to the contributions of viewers like you figs again in Bell chemistry
