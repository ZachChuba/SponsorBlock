[Music] hi it's matt and this is will it softer this week i'm going to try and make ice cream out of red wine [Music] now the thing that might affect this the most is the alcohol content i've tried bailey's before which has 17 abv whereas this is only 8 so hopefully this is less enough that it freezes but not too little that it freezes solid ah yeah that's frozen solid hasn't it have to try something in between those next time then maybe yeah nope wine will not soft serve [Music] it's cold red wine that's all it is and probably a nice long ice block in there i've left it half an hour to see if i get any more liquid out of it see if it melts a bit nothing i might even have to leave it overnight to let it dry and clean up nope absolute failure don't miss the next episode of will it soft serve
