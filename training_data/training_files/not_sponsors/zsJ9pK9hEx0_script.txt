is all captured in camera it has to be but how today's episode is brought to you by morningbrew become smarter in five minutes with their free daily newsletter good morning kevin welcome back to visual effects artists react and good morning kevin i hope you are having a great weekend so far and we're about to make it better with these clips i want to show you guys some more resident evil stuff i watched this and i just thought of like nephew vfx no one was ready no one was ready no one was ready for one person to take out a pistol so basically they eat up their practical effects budget really fast and then very quickly everything is just nephew this one's bad oh no atmospheric perspective on that wire she must be on a blue screen she's not a great yes she's on a green screen there's no way they're just popping off these squibs behind her and she's like whatever all right and meanwhile this little black line so what do you say nephew effects what we mean is like there's simple little things that just literally looking at what you're working at like you could fix it like there's literally reference in this shot all the person doing this shot with the cable needs to do is look at the color values of that soldier standing in the doorway that's the exact same color values that that black wire should have when it's at the doorway they are putting the vfx right on top of the reference and they're getting it wrong here's what i'm trying to look at is like what killed him was it the grappling hook that pierces his chest or was was it the pull and slam into the table he's just bumping the table like i i run into my own furniture at that speed like pretty frequently [Music] classical oh heck yeah umbrella branded rpgs wow she has a lot of time to react whoa there's so much time those things are literally traveling at like one mile an hour a looney tunes cut out a looty two guns perfectly circular so is anybody shooting at the same thing nobody no one knows what anyone's shooting at oh there's one guy with like a cool muzzle flash that's different in the background shooting through them by the way dude look how cg that car looks dude yeah it's not though yeah it's definitely not that's real fire thing and also notice the light on the ground yeah it does reflect in the puddles correctly but there's like a bunch of harsh matting also i feel like they actually shot full-scale cars on that exact same street that's kind of a different day filmed separately and put together but i'm inclined to think that it's still the same spot i agree on that full scale there might be a little bit of practical explosion there but i think there's a totally like artificial explosion added in after the fact oh and you can also see a total like masking line definitely not there too notice how the fire of the car is at proper exposure but the fire on the ground is slightly grayed down there's a lot of old movies out there with visual effects in them and the reason they're so special is unlike the films of today there's no 3d programs there's no after effects there's no simulations everything here is done with like actual tricks which takes me to one of my favorite things to do on this show which is to show you guys clips and how you guys guess at how they did them so we're kicking things off with the wizard of oz the tornado let's take a look it's a twisted it's a twister oh boy i was so scared of that tornado too it's a scary tornado it's still like it's very iconic and it's from 1939. look look at that it's in the background wait wait oh my okay hold up though okay they're definitely on a real set there's no way that's rear projection that'd be the biggest projection in the world oh you see it the parallax doesn't match the moment the camera started moving sideways you can see the ground moving with proper parallax but the distance was flat this is all captured in camera it has to be but how here's the thing i can go to a science museum and i can see a tornado display using fan technology you know like it exists fan technology it's definitely a created tornado of some sort like a real tornado has a lot more like diffusion at its edge rather than this which actually looks very sharp all right nico we gotta know here's what i did i gotta know it's crazy because it's so simple it's a 35 foot long muslin tube of cloth and it's on like a rolling gantry at the top and a stick on the bottom and they're moving around in opposite directions and then they have a bunch of fuller's earth which is basically a very fine earthy powder and they're spraying it into the tube from the bottom and around from the bottom they're spraying it down from the top and because the cloth itself is so loose the dust is not only building at the tops and bottoms it's also coming out the sides of the cloth giving you a smoky tube effect that's not at all what i would have expected that's it some of the shots are miniatures that it cuts to slash you know set up basically dioramas you know it's a set it's going it's forced perspective kind of stuff yeah like this this i'm pretty sure is a miniature hold up that's the exact same view that's the exact same view as the one when she was walking by except there's a fence in front of it they just use the footage they probably got that shot the previous day and then on the next day they just projected it up on the screen honestly rear projection doing that sort of thing like we're talking about mandalorian and the volume tech this is what that was back in the day also their use of fans sells everything yeah fan technology fan technology i mean honestly this movie has so much groundbreaking stuff in it yeah i totally took for granted that the tornado was like a big deal these have been some great clips and kevin if you're watching leave a comment telling everyone that they should subscribe as well thanks kevin don't let us down kevin i'm i'm trusting in you you want one more wait you got one more i want to see how you guys react to it [Applause] oh boy they're behind him now they're in front and behind him are you kidding me wait what these are ghosts i am noticing like weird shadows like i think that wait a second wait a second these these are being puppeted first off that's what i'm seeing then it's it's sticks i'm seeing something that is excluding them it's a little black hole i see the black line every once in a while and so that's a stick in the shoe dude this is the original like vfx technique okay so i am definitely seeing this [Laughter] look all these editing tricks they're using to make it look like there's shoes here so there's definitely some sort of like merging process going on between fred astaire dancing here and the shoes dancing around him i do agree that the shoes were puppeted somehow i feel like i'm gonna give you a little guidance here okay there's no puppetry those are people wearing those shoes okay okay so what are the lines then they filmed all six people doing this at the same time dressed in black on a black stage with black cloth okay so the only thing you really have is the shoes so basically just doing a screen pass from a shoe dance performance with all these people when they're doing the circle the weird lines you're seeing is them literally painting in the shoes that are being occluded from the people as they walk over the other shoes so you're seeing the legs effectively highlighted of that actor in the front with the white shoes those are their legs and they're painting the shoes behind them manually by hand okay that makes sense okay what i still do not get is how they're able to both get the shoes in front of him and behind him at the same time straight up old good fashioned hand rotowork also known as traveling mats back in the day all right wow this is legitimate rotoscoping you're talking about cutting it out and blocking it with pieces of paint and paper and all that kind of stuff we do that today like it's the same technique [Music] it takes his guns out he's just dancing he's like i think i'm a gun [Laughter] [Applause] i out of context the scene is very very funny oh my god oh well that was a special one i love old effects they're the best dude geriatric vfx they're all so clever and cool and full of trickery i'm only finding those because people happen to be like oh this is a film i watched when i was a kid and it blew my mind and they shared in the comments so please share any like old vfx from before the era of computers that feel like magic tricks and we will come in and we'll figure it out and we'll show you how it's done so speaking of older movies there's this one called honey i shrunk the kids which came out the year i was born i have not seen this movie in years but there's a lot of things just from like looking for youtube clips for this real quick that like suddenly all the nostalgia started hitting me the idea behind this movie is that you have this mad scientist tweaking around with some scientific equipment all of his children end up getting accidentally shrunk down to like a quarter inch tall and then they get stuck in the backyard instead of it being like a jungle they actually basically created all these sets and props but that's not all they did this bee for instance it's pretty good around that looks really good hey they're doing these shots pretty well yeah these background shots are pretty sweet too actually dude what a plate what these plates are really good there's a level of natural wobble and shake that makes it look kind of like on a wire or something it's totally just the dude running with the camera really dude running around with a camera hell yeah the thing that makes it work is the fact that it's an extremely wide angle lens because it makes the environment seem so much bigger which helps accentuate something that is small and so for the b they actually did a couple different things one they actually had a full-sized b set that anytime you've seen a close-up of like a person falling down and landing on the bee that's the actual prop they also had a smaller stop-motion bee with miniature people on them oh so those aren't real people on the back of it for that shot that was a miniature yeah and you know it's it's pretty well done anytime you're seeing like the full b and whatnot and it's moving really fast those are miniature people man they're handling like fuzzy edges and motion blur so well yeah i just i found a lot of this very interesting they sold to me as a child that these people were small and most of that was done with giant sets you know they made a real giant cereal bowl set that's so cool because like it's so mind-boggling to try and imagine how you would get a shot like that practically like do you just need a super small camera you're actually kind of touching on a huge problem when it comes to trying to film small things and make them feel small so when you're getting close to something you're focusing on something really close anything out of focus becomes extremely out of focus giving you very very very shallow depth of field you are going to have such a tiny fraction of a plane that's in focus and everything else will be so blurry it's going to be almost impossible to see they kind of had that problem on these movies back in the day where they're trying to make stuff feel small but they can't actually do that depth of field but recently over the last several years ant-man they did this but they actually had proper depth of field on a lot of these shots this shot starts out as a normal shot filmed with a regular camera in a regular room the field of view goes really wide but everything is still relatively in focus but as we get down to that point where the focus point is right in front of the lens that's when the depth of field really starts to get shallow and when you're filming stuff in miniature this is pretty accurate to what your lens look like in fact it would be even more out of focus exactly you could close on your aperture enough to get it to be tight and this is something you can only achieve with cg cameras you physically cannot get a lens into position because just the bulkiness of the lens would be in the way of itself i think my favorite gag out of this entire movie is when they just cut to the big looking down shot and it's like the train just stops but that's like another brilliant way to really accentuate the fact that they're all small is just reminding you they're doing a whole train fight on toys [Music] oh i just had a horrible dream i was waking up every day without today's sponsor morningbrew i had terrible dreams about information coming to me through twitter and not
