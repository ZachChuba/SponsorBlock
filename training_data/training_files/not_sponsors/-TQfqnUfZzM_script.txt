oh my god it sounds like a go-kart so the good thing about flying in a plane from the 70s it hasn't fallen apart yet legend has it that in 1970 Besser dr.aman was on a transatlantic flight from Switzerland when the flight attendant offered him a pair of headphones shortly afterward as the story goes the plane was so noisy that Bose could hardly hear the in-flight music at all so he fetched a pen and a napkin and began jotting down the first mathematical calculations for how to remove airplane noise from his listening experience fast forward 22 years and boasts released the first active noise-cancelling headphones for consumers followed 18 years later on this installment of why advertise and friendly content are you guys buying this the quiet comfort 25 which somehow are still the best selling headphones on amazon.com along with like these other super cheap ones so let's see then what makes these things so bloody special thermal takes level 20 cases beautiful tempered glass panels check them out at the link below [Music] noise cancelling headphones work by incorporating a microphone or in this case microphones uh in each ear cup on the inside by the users ear and on the outside to measure ambient sound they take that ambient sound measurement and they compare it to the desired signal coming from your device and then they generate a new waveform that's exactly equal but opposite to the noise coming in destroying the unwanted waves by way of destructive interference so as you can imagine this technology works better on frequencies that are consistent which is why noise cancelling headphones are awesome at filtering out noise from airplane engines or HVAC systems but not so great when it comes to crying babies and annoying coworkers since the year 2000 release of the original quiet comfort acoustic noise-canceling headphones now known as the QC ones Bose has released a new set in the lineup at least every three years including the Google assistant equipped QC 35 series twos that launched in late 2017 for 350 dollars pretty pricey and out of reach for a lot of people now the best-selling headphones on Amazon and therefore the true subject of this video are these QC 25 originally from 2014 they only cost about a hundred and eighty bucks on Amazon today if you go for the Apple version with the version for Android devices being $20 more for some reason but the only difference is the functionality of the inline controls so we grab the Apple version and give it a shot on an Android phone turns out we were actually still able to play and pause our music and even skip tracks but there was no volume control and when we tried to use it to hang up a phone call music started playing instead so if that stuff matters to you then you should either pay the extra $30 or try your luck on a cheaper third-party cable but then hold on a second as evidenced by my almost entirely faded eyebrow ring scar it is not the year 2000 anymore there are actually a bunch of noise cancelling alternatives to Bose like the super popular cow any sevens that are a fraction of the price so how is a $200 product still on top when every other product in this appetizer series has been budget AF well it's because low price doesn't mean high value and people purchase products in order to get a job done whether that's a sound bar whose job is to make dialogue easier to hear a tablet whose job is to play Netflix in bed and not be destroyed by your kids or a 4k Smart TV whose job is to be 4k and a TV that's like maybe smart or something so then what's the job to get done with noise canceling headphones may be comfortable airline travel or a Productivity at your desk well that means that automatically Bose is targeting a more affluent clientele people with jobs or who travel regularly and the bottom line is that the qc25 s are really good at their job something that is worth paying a little extra for not only do they offer category leading noise cancellation they are also really comfortable for hours at a time and they're super portable thanks to their folding headband and lightweight rugged carrying case after all that the fact that they punch way above their weight in terms of sound quality is almost just a bonus now that's the frenzy value that we expect in this series or at least that's what I would be saying if the three top-rated customer reviews for this product weren't all one-star now if you sell enough headphones you're bound to get a bad review or two but it's become enough of a pattern that it appears as though Bose has been scrimping on the materials lately a lot of these things seem to struggle to last longer than a year to a year and a half so if you're not into that sort of thing maybe you should save your money after all especially considering that the best selling headphones in the on air and the in-ear categories are both super cheap the most popular honors are actually these the new K 11s I can't quite figure out why but I do have at least a theory so they're marketed towards kids with bright colors a durable braided cable and a parent friendly price of just fifteen dollars but there's a lot of headphones for kids out there what makes these one stand out I think is the fact that they're used for parents too so the headband expands from child size to absolute melon the sound quality isn't complete trash and they go loud which is unusual since a lot of kids cans have volume limiters on them for safety I mean who needs safety when you got convenience right the suckiest thing about these as far as I can tell is the fit so the ear cups don't articulate which means that at least with the pair we've got and on my head they don't quite sit flush against my ears so they don't seal particularly well you won't have to worry about that though with the best-selling IEMs the Panasonic Peugeot fit earbuds for under $10 of the 54 thousand reviews of these things 82% of people gave them a four or five because they fit well they sound decent and they can last for years and years I might explain how they've been around since at least 2012 look at this the box still says iPod on it though still exists that but anyway if your phone still has a headphone jack there's really no reason not to check out any one of the three options that we gave you guys today just make sure that you're putting them on
