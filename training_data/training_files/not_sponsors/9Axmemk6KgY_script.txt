today I have a rather spicy video for the boys so stay tuned standing beside my character and looking very similar is the pure sub the objective for this video is to make as much old school runescape GP as possible and the way we're gonna do this is pretend to be PV Emmer's in the revenant caves the revenant caves have proven to be one of the most profitable areas for PB Emmer's to make GP which means that killing these guys is insanely profitable the way this is gonna work is quite simple me and said we're gonna pretend to be killing revenants wait for the perfect target to log in that looks like they're risking a fair amount and then one-shot them what sir see ya so we're gonna do this for roughly one to two hours and see how much we make before we get into being today's sponsor let's get back into the video we just run in with vengeance like we'll do the three two one I mean the one two three see you know one shelf now to make the most money possible we are going to be killing mostly people with revenant weapons such as the crossbow and begorrah chain mace this was the first clip I'm going in in three two one I'm going now that was perfect your loot oh I got a meal do but I have no invent space literally the first guy we kill already giving us one mil loot I'm just gonna attack orc I'm gonna attack work to make it you can go in while on the technical work yeah I'm ready three two oh [ __ ] dude Benji yeah okay see you and I know I'm gonna venge from here okay tell me when you're coming already yeah I'm ready three two one I clicked attack okay well I won't wait too early I think oh no way dude yes yes nice little yet it's your loot okay money ever very no which is we actually it's been three kills we've made two mo quick mistake it's literally been like 15 minutes like 10 minutes of actual kills will go for umbrella then I guess there we go is three two one go MSB was mighty my dad let's have you got anything he's lost at me I got it what do you get oh [ __ ] [ __ ] Oh cause after sorry not a crossbow out there you ran away from me maybe we should both just go next to them yeah that's what I was thinking I think he saw you binge 364 K it was

do we're gonna go for the double whammy here you know there's an 80 right here on the table goblin just go 80 80 see ya oh he's gone see you oh but do you get a [ __ ] 300k I'll take it since we had to lose our skull every time I would just go into my house into the dungeon suicide to the lava and then my skull would be gone the fact that we look like PB Emmer's P cares will never expect us to double-team them especially when they have huge items that are potentially slidable oh please smited no way dude there's no way we didn't smite him anything okay I need a ranger right I think I just died here so I don't get smite it yeah dragon on dragon we can go for him three two okay he's gonna move he's you know okay Donna see ya he threw this guy so much think this guy has have so much loot that's bank D one mil 40k ready yep three two one Oh major major major major yep here Lou I don't want mill again oh yeah look at your screen waiting yo your Mountain is exactly how much I got on the last kill literally back to back to mill in what six minutes he's like orange South orc just let me know when cuz I'm literally on this kid 3 3 1 P spot see ya see ya yeah why don't you tell you oh ok ok oh hi wish we won spectrum so we could have kept going oh he's on demon yeah I'm ready when I beat ya to 1by he's dead 450 kid eh he just gotta kill ya wait I just actually ran bowed I had like a double 24 and I wasn't even I was frayed piety now I didn't show every single kill we did get in this video but we were racking up kills left and right and I managed to get three point five millimeter kills so we tallied up ur loot and this is what happened you either you go like double this or if not more so for an hour and a half 53 bracelets Seb ended up getting 7.3 mildew and in total this means that an hour and a half just killing the revenant p.m. errs we made 11 mil between the two of us which is 5.5 milli now of course this wasn't enough money for us so what we decided to do was liquidate all of the loot give it to Seb and he was gonna stake it for us to see if we could double our money oh this is such a bad idea here it is 11 no good luck man if we win this we walk oh I need to find you oh I found you good luck there is please tank yes double double up or nothing good luck man if we win this we walk dude double up for nothing oh my god this will be 21 million in an hour and a half each 3 3 to 14 20 to 10 [Music] no way dude dude it's a 26 HP new 224 so I was like oh and then we killed him I was like what that's how you conclude a video right there but yeah that is the end of the video I'd say a pretty successful day on old school runescape 21 point 75 milk each in literally one hour and a half plus the stakes obviously we ballsed up we went for the double up and it paid off I am gonna leave Pierce EPS channel in the description go over to his channel subscribe to him he has some of the creamiest pecan content on this game period yeah be sure to subscribe
