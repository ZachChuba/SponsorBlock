for 21 days jagex has given us a special world 10 times xp five times drop rates and if we don't get all of these items in the next 21 days rag is going skydiving and i'm getting a runescape tattoo we've been live streaming this over 10 hours every single day over on twitch so if you want to watch it live the link will be in the description welcome to group iron man mode thanks to mech arena for sponsoring today's video is this chest number four yeah chest number four coming up you're [ __ ] me wait what we already have that we got that just before that's not okay no jagex absolutely no that's not fair that's not fair i guess there's there's one for me one for link i can't even wear it yet that's so funny chest number five coming right up oh my gosh this is amazing i love this i love this so much i love this so much we need food you know i almost died like twice with this damn trout this is so great i love this game i love this game so much we have chess six coming on up you're [ __ ] me you are you're acting this is a joke this is actually a joke this is the funniest thing that's ever happened to me dude okay i know this is six chests but we're like every time i do pvp challenges we times this by five in in 30 chests i don't get this lucky ever ever link i just got you a derrick's plate body my man so that's too funny chest number seven coming on up oop search the chest oh i'll link link what have you got darroch's helm we're getting there we're getting there darroch's is now our closest item we're unique or forward i've ruined that clip for a unique what am i talking about chess number eleven oh link link link you're gonna love me you're gonna love me you are absolutely gonna love me what is it an arum's robe skirt oh yes skins that is some zorra gear if i've ever seen any yes skinnington another chest coming up what do we get what do we get oh link another unique another unique a brassard we got the brassy got the brassy that's not bad all right guys we're about to uh take on this fight with uh the guy in the fremick trials this is a dangerous area and we will lose our hardcore status if we die on the last form we do let ourselves die because uh that doesn't actually kill us but um if we go ahead and do this we can take in a dream and stuff here by uh using that on the branch so we can't take a weapon in you're prob you're not meant to be able to take weapons in but that's one of the little tricks you can do um and yeah let's uh let's start this zach can you use prayer in here oh you can use prayer in here i didn't think you could use prayer in here okay well this is gonna be way easier than i thought it was going to be ah the prayer gets drained okay so apparently the prayer gets drained in later forms so that's why this is a little bit more difficult than it probably looks right now but uh we're gonna absolutely smash through i think we kill the first three and then he sort of goes berserk and he starts hitting like ones and fours like every tick so i think that's what we need to uh look out for and i think that's when we let ourselves die but you know what i might just try and fight the whole thing out there we go and i think this might be the nuts one yeah this is the nuts one and our prayer is completely drained we're gonna try and win we're gonna try and win we'll see what happens and yeah he's completely drained our prior that's uh that's what's going on here so uh doesn't look like we're gonna hit either he's not hitting too well himself um do not leave the fight we have to fight again you must now either die safe death but the problem is with group iron man they've changed how the death mechanics work so like james eric for example on a normal hardcore is uh is safe but on group hardcore it's not we cannot hit we can't hit oh dear oh dear and yeah another example of that is like the fight caves on a hardcore normally that's completely safe you can try it as many times as you want on a group hardcore it's not but we have been told by multiple sources this is safe so we're gonna take that we're gonna take that and we're gonna go with it being safe we'll see what happens i'm pretty sure he actually puts you down to one hp and then you sort of like fake die um is how this death actually works so we will see what happens here but there's no way we're going to be able to kill him and i don't want to waste the man to raise on something like this if we do lose the life here then i've lost both the lives in the matter of hours which would be great um but i'm pretty sure this one will be a safe here we go guys one more hit we've got two hp and yeah there you go it's like a fake death one hp left one hp and we're okay we're all good hey oh my gosh we got the axe and another skirt no yes yes kid dude if we get the derog's legs that is it that's literally it yes oh my gosh dude what that's naughty that's naughty oh the double chest the arms is so pog mate because for [ __ ] we're both gonna wanna guys i know it's five times drop right but we are still getting insanely lucky oh my god what is it what is it link if i said i got the two meaniest items oh you saw we take the hood we take the hood we take the hood we take the hood baby we got the koif2 link yeah i know i saw that i saw that but we we do take the hood i think the hood's genuinely good yeah wow wow oh my god oh my god we did it what is it holy [ __ ] is it done oh my god 22 chances [Laughter] yes kidding to the bear that's very son obviously we're gonna stay here but oh my god we need to get another tank set dude what another tile knocked off the axe is in the bank that's mad just to show you guys the full darroch i am in shock i am in absolute shock the stream's in shock right now link's in shock it's just it's absolutely crazy the fact that i still have to do barrows for a second tank set and we already have a complete set is insanity so we are going back oh my god what a chest what a chest what a chest two very needed pieces what oh my gosh okay we need a tank helm we need a tank helm and an arms top tank helmet arms top coming right up next chest i'm calling it all right guys we're about to finish off uh the friendly kyle's here we're just doing the last bit of the quest where you have to sort of like take on all the trolls kill a few of them um we got enough food on us we should be good we're gonna put up as well um and yeah then we're gonna take on the boss after this i think we can sort of retreat and let them do it as well because i'm feeling a little bit worried about how much damage i'm taking i think we can sit here the ones that we've attacked if they die we'll uh we'll get the kill yeah that should be probably the way to do it here because we do want to save as much food as possible for the boss we do have the emergency telly out as well if all goes to [ __ ] but uh we should be all right let's go for this all right into the boss the ice troll king here let's go we should be all right we got given some prayer pot some food by the guy so we can just uh sit here and we'll go max it 25 cool we're cool we're cool his max it seems to be at 25 here we're banging through as well cannot hit though cannot hit we're really struggling to hit come on keep going 18 nice come on i think i'm not sure if the quest completes right here as well guys we might not even have to talk to anyone but we are gonna go get our um helmet is not of course there we go jobby there we go down he goes and it's a very similar to elvarg where we have to just take off the head boom pretty sure the exact same animation to be honest decapitated head uh we're just gonna walk back to be honest we got the supplies we've got the food [ __ ] okay you know what let's just play it safe let's play it safe all right guys this is gonna be the fremnik isles completed uh once we're done with this chat uh where are we gonna put this xp you know what we'll put it into defense um obviously this isn't too crazy xp things are on the ten times there it is there she is the helm of nate is not i'm so excited for that i've also just seen that kim's got a carol's top over at barrow so that's pretty hype as well here we go so i got the brother right but i got the um oh yeah this is recording that's awkward they have anybody watching has no context of what i'm even talking about oh okay that's a unique that's a unique that's gonna pop up on the floor nice that is our second varex piece new chest coming up that's really good we already have tank legs but um that is an upgrade to the guffin skirt right there that is actually the best tank legs we could possibly get so we're definitely to pick that up until i'm out of here oh my gosh oh [ __ ] oh guys sorry i'm live right now and this is just so hype and my mind was not expecting to get that and i don't know what to say right now but that is that's that's that's pog see i'm speaking like a true twitch streamer right now that's amazing link is gonna be so happy when he wakes up tomorrow i'm not gonna look actually it's gonna be kind of hard um i'm not looking chat what did we get i i can't see tora cam what do we got are you serious i thought we got the helm they're two dupes there are two dupes we have should i just tell you should i just tell you leave them here so we just did some questing a few hours of questing honestly a bit more getting all the materials for this dang quest but that is in the aid of the meyer or the mirror key done i really don't know how to pronounce that word this is so we can get a bunch of silver oars to ultimately go right for the 85 crafting we can boost that to 90 after we do evil dave stew so ultimately we are going for that fury next that's gonna be my next unlock as link is focusing on zora he might even get that onyx if not we can easily easily buy one with all the money we have or go to revs stuff like that so right now just focus on that 85 crafting and we're gonna send some temple trekking because dalkin fang has got across the swamp and he's a bit too scared [Music] oh my god yes oh yes we're starting to get there unreal stuff uh stats here three prayer three melee strength no negatives um at all and we do actually get positive magic defense of this as well so a huge helm until we get something better in the later challenges oh my god we're done on to lunar diplomacy so we can get cure me for zoro um and then i'm going to do majoring a one and two so that i can get that unreal cape um so that that's just gonna be massive for cox and and zara and stuff like that um so a little bit more questing slash mini games from me and then i'll be looking really really sweet and we'll go for a high range level we'll probably smash this up to like 80 mage and then we will go and hit zoro up so to do lunar diplomacy i'm gonna need 60 mining and 61 crafting so we're doing some mining here with the gold and then i'm going to turn them all into like sapphire rings or you know games necklaces stuff like that rings are dueling um so that we can get that crafting up uh the mining once we've got the crafting level i'll probably just go on and do uh something like you know three tick iron or something just to get that that level as quickly as possible and then yeah we'll go do the lunas all right guys this is gonna be shiloh village completed which we actually had to do before we can move on and do lunar diplomacy so uh there we go 3800 crafting xp very very nice um yeah on to luna now 52 quest points we've got let's do it okay guys this is gonna be luna diplomacy completed let's talk to her and this should bring us the completed quest there we go 5000 magic 5000 runecrafting xp the ability to use lunar spells and 50 astral runes as well 22 runecrafting coming in there straight off the bat which you know what isn't too bad with the ten times xp skipping those early levels is pretty nice 1 300 total coming in um i think i will change my spell book as well uh the reason again for those of you who missed it was that we are going for the heel or kill me which is i think it was like 60 something there kill group cure me 71 so we do need to get ourselves a room pouch together because i don't want to bring three runes into zola so room pouches is on the list of things to go and get but uh pretty happy with that now that we've completed it i'm gonna go and do all of the pre-wrecks with zara so we've got all of that ready and uh yeah zoro today so we're just cutting up the last of the diamonds here and um for the past six slash seven hours or so i've been doing temple trekking as well as coming down to the blast furnace to buy out all the silver ore that i can this guy stocks back his were really weird this miner brings him ore and whatever he says over his head that's how much that shop refills so for example 40 pieces of coal added but no one's buying the coal if it was silver it would have restocked it by 40 silver so i was able to buy it pretty quick from here so there's of course that 64 thieving we need about 5.4 k silver tr is made these two added up or around that and uh plus we can make some gold jewelry with some of the um gems that we just caught for 64. so we should have plenty of materials the smithing slash craft and grind is officially underway of course we have like those 2k ores in the bank that we also have to convert and then also make into tiaras um shouldn't really be too bad it's going to be pretty afk but it will take a little bit of time decided not to do the varrock easy to use the edgeville furnace because when compared to mount carlum where i am right now it's actually only a one square difference and with 192 trips it'll only save me like three minutes in the long run 285 and of course the easy diary will take more than three minutes i've actually decided to spend some money and buy some more gnats and keep buying at the shop in order to super heat the silver ore completely forgot that i actually need 87 magic i believe it is for enchant onyx but i can do it with 84 with a plus three boost with a wizard mind bomb so technically that's only two levels and i don't really have too much silver order to do so i might get the level i might not i haven't run the calcs but just getting that xp really can't hurt and plus we'll get some of this money back whenever we sell or alk the tiaras so i'm really not too bothered and again money is always pretty easy to get on these accounts and there is 84 magic so the magic level 4 fury is now achieved this is gonna be underground pass completed and then it's just regised and we have done all the quests we need to do load of xp coming in there we did get the ibin stuff but obviously we're going to be going with the trident we have we're skipping right over that no need to spend like 200k on that and uh yeah we will uh continue on with our zorro grind okay this should be regised completed and technically everything we need to do for zorro but i am going to have to get myself prepped 15k 13k agility xp as well 64 agility coming in there and uh yeah as i say we are now's already but i want a room pouch i need to get broad bolts as well so we're gonna have to unlock broader fletching so i've got a bit of slayer to do um for those points and then uh yeah we'll go for it all right guys so i've just started doing some assignments and we're going through the range levels but what i'm gonna do is actually trade with cristilia or go with the rewards and we'll grab going to grab ourselves the uh broader fletching we do have enough points which means all i need to do now is go and get 52 or 55 fletching so that i can make broad arrows and then broad bolts and then we can use um all the knives that i've made i've made a load of knives um so that we can get 61 range and then we'll pull out the rune crossbow do a few more uh levels probably get to 70 70 plus so we can wear the carols and then we're going to zara all right guys i know i said i was over already but i decided to just quickly go and hit roving elves up so that we could get the crystal shield oh yes 10 000 uh strength xp and this is just gonna be such a naughty thing to use uh for killing zola we do get the negative 10 magic and range but the defensive bonuses on it are just so so worth it especially with taking no uh magic defense uh bonus you know no negative on it so massively worth getting and yeah pretty happy with that so there's another upgrade we also do have 61 range as well so we can now wield that uh rune crossbow i'm going to get this up to 70 so we can use the carols that kin's got from barrows and then it is zorro time so now that we're over 80 crafting we can actually make two glories and also two dragon bracelets which of course become the combat bracelet i mean i plan on getting myth gloves very soon but you know we have the material so let's just turn this into two combat bracelets let's um add the balls of wool real fast and then we can enchant this and link that is a glory for you and a combat bracelet for you as well as myself linky boy we are just about to get that 85 in one more silver and that is it for the crafting hopefully there is no more crafting on these accounts we can't get a freeway just yet we do have to or i have to do the evil day portion of rest before disaster and also we need the onyx we might hold up on the onyx a bit though but as long as we have all the grind to actually get the fury you know i'm not too worried i mean we have glories now so it's fine but i'm gonna do some questing now and start tackling that rfd i'm real stuff man on the rail we just did a bunch of questing we completed the evil dave's portion of rest before disaster now we are completing the uh karamja easy i guess just put it in slayer we can always use slayer xp i usually put it to herblore but links the herb the herbist of us too so um yeah now we have the gloves we just have to wait a little bit of time honestly not long at all we need 29k chaos runes in order to purchase that onyx so we're going to wait a little bit buy out that shop and then go buy that onyx and here we go didn't take long at all to sell that with the um little ruin light feature and there is the onyx for the first fury this crowd has been incredible but we are not done yet we still need to boost with the stew of course and a plus five boost isn't exactly the nicest thing to get so i'm not really looking forward to it but is what it is oh here we go here we go here we go here we go use that on that and then enchant it oh my gosh guys and that is the amulet of fury on the account which is the best necklace we are definitely going to get we're only going to make one for now and guys it's also on the bingo board there it is there's that am little fury we're probably going to give this over to link as i'm probably going to focus more on slaying as he's going to be doing some zoro but um oh yes that's amazing [Music] [Music] you
