this is a video of what happens when you enable a feature of tests of yourself without Tesla's permission think I'm kidding well this whole YouTube channel is built on my struggles of me getting parts of this Carly see in front of you that I built going on five years now nothing between projects I call tests out there mistakes and a year ago I told you guys about the emmc chip issue that plagues older Tesla's where the car slows down to a crawl until it stops working all together forcing you to go back to Tesla to spend $2,000 only for it to happen again eventually and before that video there was how not to get ripped off buying a used model three where buyers were getting the cars tax credits and then selling the cars again for retail pricing also how we improve the design of the Tesla door handles never to fail an tesla versus the NHTSA where tesla refused to swap the mandatory recall airbags on a car until i made a video on it and they decided to obey the law then last but not least the infamous has tesla gone too far video where a customer came in for service while on a road trip to us to remove supercharging ability on his car didn't tell him and when he got to the nearest supercharger during his trip his car wouldn't charge he wasn't near any other level to charging and it left him and his family stranded now this was over two years ago and i put these things out of my mind so when i got an e-mail linking to a recent article about tesla disabling supercharging i laughed because i thought it was a rehash of a two-year old story but i read the article and it was more the same tesla to disable super charging on vehicles that are salvage cars or doesn't seem fit to use their charging network which they provide as a service my opinion on that well it's really up to them it's Tesla's network they own it and they determined that a specific caution used their resources then quite frankly they have every right to do that they don't want cars with their charging infrastructure that were put together by anyone else but Tesla because they may have been repaired improperly and when a Tesla blows up it makes the news and it's bad publicity for the company now a regular Tesla fresh from the factory has no problem exploding on its own and they don't want to add and properly repaired cars to that mix too so I understand however I read the article and it looks like Tesla has updated their policy quite a bit and it's starting to get a little creepy now here's an updated copy of Tesla's salvage car policy now it says Tesla doesn't recommend buying a car that's until Tesla could confirm that it's up to Tesla's standards to drive the car can be unsafe to you Tesla employees or Tesla's equipment now I really appreciate Tesla looking out for its employees and they usually do except when they have to ramp up Martin 3 production and Tesla's having employees work in an outdoor tent producing cars and racking up OSHA violations but that's fine I will say however this is where it gets creepy Tesla uses the foaming resources to determine whether or not a vehicle has been classified as Salvage government or regulatory agencies what are the regulatory agencies let's look this up hold on hold on hold on they're gonna call the DEA after me the FTC the ATF they will also use Tesla approved body shops results of other internal investigations car fax and internet forums and vehicle auction sites Tesla is going full crazy ex-girlfriend you they're searching forums now Internet chat rooms yo ASL what's your zodiac sign you got an illegal Tesla or vehicle auction sites do they even have this man power Tesla is short staffed as it is and just think okay when you call them and they don't answer the phone there's a guy who was browsing forums looking for VIN numbers to snitch on people there is an internal Tesla snitch and I'm sure they take their jobs very seriously now Tesla apparently fired the guy that's in charge of making sure your body panels line up and hire the snitch instead but it gets better folks now here's where I get a lot of this verbage that says you can't bring a steaming pile and expect tussah to repair it which I understand anytime they can carry can't just bring a car off the street and expect Tesla employees to work on it especially if it's unsafe I get that any warranties are void ok standard practice and you could still use your mobile app which is good ok but they terminate super charging now now while back you can get your car recertified and get super charging working now they won't even allow super charging again but hold on access to third-party fast charges those aren't super chargers Tussle doesn't own that you don't own that network so you can't access third-party fast charging either this reaches extending beyond Tesla's network alone it gets more bizarre the more you read Tesla has every right to disable super charging on any vehicle it thinks is on again I get that you don't want to destroy the supercharging infrastructure but also make it so you can't charge fast charging via third-party either that just seems weird let's keep going if a Tesla has been found to enable super charging and/or fast charging through a third party charger Tesla may take legal action and seek compensation so Tesla's going to sue me notice they didn't say if a person uses a supercharger when they shouldn't be they just said if you enable it so if I enable it and don't use a supercharger I'll have a lawsuit on my hands potentially so my question is who owns the car literally you don't own the car people I get the Tesla doesn't want you to use their supercharger but they can seek legal compensation if you modify your car to enable super charging then in the next sentence contact Tesla if you learn of modifications that will enable super charging or third-party charging by an unsupported vehicle now they want you to snitch Tesla has officially lost their damn minds so wait us is all about safety right why not make the classes that you teach public why not have the classes to more than just Tesla body shops and like three random and community colleges if they want the cost be mainstream why are you teaching more people about how to be safe around them instead of having this veil of secrecy around the cars and best of all why not charge for the glasses and make some more money not everyone wants to be a body shop and require quarter million dollars in tools some places just want to be able to inspect repair the cars and send them on their way so they don't have weeks for a service center call just like the electrified garage one of the reasons why electrified garage works so well is because there are literally two former and tussle employees that run the shop that kind of information doesn't really exist anywhere else now on a side note I found the world's highest mileage Tesla Model X I want to buy this car you can definitely check it out here to only $36,000 but it has four hundred thousand miles which I think if you talk them down to the low 30s that's definitely a good deal the only problem is I don't have 36 grand kicking around so I got to free up some funds thankfully upstart upstart for sponsoring a boy uncle rich yet again but on a serious note I buy that car without hesitation because of the electrified garage if you do buy it let us know we can check it out for you it's a perfect car to start your YouTube career now that's what I was saying you literally don't own the car tusla is quote unquote preventing problems before they arise by proactively disabling supercharging for vehicles now those cars haven't even used their network it's very similar to being guilty until proven innocent now the reason why I'm having a hard time rocking my run around this is that Tesla is going into the cars they don't own and making modifications now the better way in my opinion but what do I know to do it would be to have a protocol live on the superchargers themselves right now the ability for a car to supercharge lives on the car so Tesla sends the signal to the car and they can toggle supercharging on or off if the ability to supercharge was determined by the charger itself that's a much easier pill to swallow because Tesla isn't extending their reach into the cars it along their own they're just adding a list of VIN numbers that shouldn't be able to charge at the charges themselves and when the person tries to use it they're denied because the supercharger says no to the car now that's what's really getting to me is also them reaching to third party fast chargers as well as Tesla so not only reaching into their car they're also reaching to things beyond their own network that they're trying to protect now the sibling charging before anyone uses it is like someone else cutting your penis off just in case you're planning on having sex you didn't have sex no were you planning on it but we're gonna cut it off just in case and that example was a reach I'd much rather have Tufts remove the network capability from the car themselves once they're in an accident meaning they can kill the data plan which Tesla pays for so we know to leave the cars in the scrap yard let's have a general discussion about these connected cars as of said as I want to be at these manufacturers for things that they can do I find it completely amazing at their capability for example this is an all-wheel drive long range Tesla Model 3 it costs forty eight thousand nine hundred ninety dollars now this is a performance long range Tesla Model 3 that costs fifty six thousand nine hundred ninety dollars that gives you better performance now a quick math that's a price difference of eight thousand dollars and the difference software literally over-the-air Tesla can make your car worth eight thousand dollars more but on the flip side eight thousand dollars less same thing with self-driving Tesla charges seven thousand dollars more for this but the car already has the hardware built into it all Tesla has to do is pretty much Chuck a box and your car has a feature that most automatic factures would have to install physical hardware for which quite frankly is genius from a cost savings and automation standpoint now here's where it gets weird when you buy your Tesla Model 3 or any other Tesla and pay extra for self-driving Tesla assigns that to an individual meeting you so when you trade in the car - Tesla guess what you paid for that service for your enjoyment not the next person so when Tesla goes to sell that car the new person has to pay for the self-driving again it's actually genius so in theory the model 3 is sold back the Tesla 3 times like it's ten in a twenty one thousand dollars off of one car without touching it not bad huh and they also reserve the right to remove the service of any car at any time now that we know how much control Tesla has let's touch back the Tesla and employee safety now if we're cognitive to an accident and someone puts it back together wrong to bring it to Tesla to fix the issue is safety which again I get post collision you don't know the state of the battery if it's a ticking time bomb or how much of it was damaged but do you believe that you think the company that built the cars can't tell the status of the battery you think the company that was bragging about the car can proactively order parts for itself when it needs service can't tell if the car safe to drive and operate do you feel my sarcasm building because they can there's typically 16 24 volt battery modules in a Tesla pack each one has its own BMS not only that but you can actually segment those get even more granular to see what specific cells have a lower voltage reading before the car even starts a supercharger even turn on for that matter the BMS runs internal tests to make sure it's safe to close the contactors and activate the 400 volt system the BMS also monitors all internal temps so you have about a 0% chance of starting a fire if the BMS passed all the tests Tesla can see all the faults in the car remotely so when Tesla says they don't know something or they're uncertain about safety why not just hire the guy that's in charge of searching forms for VIN numbers for cars to help out now before I wrap up I just want to clarify one last thing now while back someone said I wasn't about the mission and how I'm making Tesla look bad and if I don't like the cars I should just sell them number one I don't know what your mission is or what that means number two I'm a Tesla shareholder so every time someone asks what evie they should get Tesla usually comes up in that conversation and as a result thousands of people have purchased Tesla's because of watching the videos now their cars aren't perfect and everyone knows they aren't but when I call Tesla out I'm accused of being a hater after the Vice special weeks later Tesla changes their stance on prior salvage cars allowing people to buy parts and because of my videos I allowed my friend to get his airbag replaced under the cata recall which has to refuse originally I literally owned a garage that repairs and services Tesla's and whether you think I'm wrong or right and whether my methods are less than conventional that's fine but I'm fighting for something I want Tesla to do better and be better so before you take shots at me ask yourself what are you doing I'll see you all next week
