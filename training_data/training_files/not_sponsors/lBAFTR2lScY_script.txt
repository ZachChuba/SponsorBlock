apart how I expose for an image nowadays and how I'd learned from cinema to protect my highlights first and push everything in the image slightly darker keeping those highlights protected right up front in my exposure and also have shooting that way had taught me something about life in general that it was important to protect my highlights to preserve those good moments of my journey as I go along and not obsess about the negatives as we're all prone to do the photography is always a given a take and it has to be a compromise somewhere and if you learn to protect your highlights at the top end of your exposure by bringing everything down you're also going to need to learn to embrace your shadows because as you bring that exposure down protecting those highlights right at the top you will create more shadows in your work and you're going to have to make friends with them or at least you're gonna have to learn how to use them more deliberately let's unpack this a little bit I remember going through a stage when I started out photography which I think a lot of people go through where I quickly got disillusioned with what a camera could do I think I had some naive ideas that it was gonna see like I could see or even better that I would see a scene take a photo and it would somehow sing even more when I took a photograph of it but the reality was I would go out and shoot a landscape or shoot a street scene and standing there on the day I could remember all the tones right the way through from the brightest white clouds all the way into the deepest shadows the image I could see all that beautiful detail but when I brought that camera home and put the image on my computer and pulled it into Lightroom or whatever program I was using I remember being really disappointed by the fact that it just seemed full of dark shadows that I couldn't see into anymore and I remember what they look like standing there and it definitely didn't look like what this camera was showing me and I had this rude awakening where I suddenly realized that no camera is ever gonna be able to see like I can see they're limited so I compensated I was already shooting raw but I started going out and shooting bracketing exposes three four five different exposures pulling them together into HDR images even when I was only processing a raw file I would Jack up shadow sliders and black sliders and clarity sliders because I felt like if I could see dark shadows in my images I'd failed somehow that I had lost detail or thrown away information that if I stood there on the day and I could see all that tonal range but I couldn't see there my image somehow I messed up and of course as I brutally tried to bully these images to see the way that I saw they decided to break apart and I get artifacting and banding and haloing and it just looked like badly processed HDR because I was so scared of those shadows I hadn't yet learned to embrace the shadows that I could actually take the limitations of the camera and use it to create something even more interesting so we did this last time but let's just recap this bar represents our human eye and how much dynamic range we can take in any one second with our brightest highlights up at this end and our darkest shadows down at this end now here is our cameras dynamic range which can't see as much as our human eye can see in any given second which means it has to choose where it needs to be on this line and which of the dynamic range I can take in it wants to capture and anything that falls outside of this camera dynamic range is lost information so if I meter right up the middle here it means I'm going to lose the highlights on this end they're going to blow to white and I'm gonna lose the shadows down this end they're gonna crunch down to black so for the sake of this little demo and this might be a little confusing but it'll make sense in a second if I slide my camera dynamic range this way up towards the high light it means I'm darkening down the exposure to capture the last of the highlights if I go this way it means I'm lightening up the exposure to bring in more of the shadows so say for example I wanted to capture the deepest darkest shadows I didn't want to lose any of that information that was for some reason a priority for me that means I would take my camera dynamic range I would brighten up my shot I keep brightening it to include more of that shadow detail until I capture the last of those shadows that I could see with my human eye but that also means that everything that falls outside of that camera's dynamic range is lost information in this case that means that all these highlights here on this scale would have been blown to white if I meet to the camera right down the middle for a scene right at zero it means the I'm gonna lose some highlights and some shadows there's gonna be some highlights blown to white and some shadows which have crunched down to black in my case what I've been doing more and more is darkening down my image taking it this way dark and damaged to capture the last of those highlights are making sure I don't lose any information in my highlights but this is why I say I have to make friends with my shadows and embrace them and learn how to use them because in doing this I've created all this space outside of the cameras dynamic range which is creating a lot of shadows that I can deal with and hopefully use creatively when it comes to embracing shadow is there's no better place I think to look for creative use of shadows than in the movies and I'm going to show you some stills from movies from one of my favorite cinematographers Roger Deakins and this these four here are from Skyfall one of the latest James Bond movies you can see I mean this was a famous shot in a fight scene you can see he's deliberately exposed for this fire in the background and created this beautiful silhouette of main villain characters of walking towards a fight and this is one of the first shots in the movies and you can see he's deliberately just put a almost as neutered light on half of the face which you know might not be how you want to introduce a character or you'd think you definitely wouldn't want to shoot a portrait this way but but why not I mean creating so much shadow in the face creates a bit of mystery and tells much more of a story than panicking about losing shadow detail this is one of the famous fight scenes in the movie as well but he's almost got two silhouettes fighting each other using these sort of plasma screens in the background to just create light from the back so you can't actually see the faces of the people you don't really see close-up movements in the shots it's all sort of wide shot silhouettes battling with each other which I think creates a really interesting mood and then this scene is one of the early ones in the movies as well just after this shot where Barnes was it enters a room and you can see you know you can see what he's looking at you can see the shape of this guy who's obviously in trouble here on it on the chair but so just lit on one side on the highlights and everything else in the room is so dark I mean we're not seeing a lot of detail and bond himself which arguably is our main character in this shot he is silhouetted and I think all these uses of shadows creates a really interesting feel in storytelling if we take another one Blade Runner which 2049 which is the latest Blade Runner which deacon's shot as well I mean this for me was an absolutely stunning movie I mean to look at the cinematography in this movie he actually won the Oscar for this one and the use of colors and lights in it throughout the whole movie is brilliant but I think what's more interesting and especially more relevant for this is how he uses shadows against of almost using silhouetted people against lights in the background this shots way you know you again you've got a silhouette moving into light and someone diving out of this light and water coming through this was an incredible scene at the beginning of the movie this is sort of Ryan Gosling's character has to come to Batista's characters houses of interview him and find out a bunch of stuff and the whole house is extremely dimly lit I mean in this shot you've really only got these two windows you obviously got some extra lights and coming in a little bit but look how much of the frame is kept dark and in shadow and in mystery and even the characters themselves are silhouetted you can't really see them and you'd think to yourself that's not enough to light a scene yet he's doing it to great effect and he uses amazing light and reflection throughout the movies as well and again like just I'm not saying to light your images like this and maybe you do want to light them like this and have a very cinematic feel but I think what this demonstrates is is how you can actually use shadows don't panic about losing the detail as long as you're being deliberate about how you're using the shadows and your frame here's just a few random ones from other ones of Deacons movies this is a shot from jarhead which i think is such a such an amazing shot I mean just beautiful abstract almost showing the oil fires and you know silhouettes of soldiers cleaning up and one of our main characters in the foreground here just exposing for the highlights and the flame this is one from Jesse James another movie of here's again like light coming through steam in the background you can just make a little bit of detail with light wrapping around the site but otherwise your main character is just silhouetted with the guns on the side and obviously the train which is throwing at the steam again really creative uses of shadows and silhouettes this is from unbroken which was certainly Angelina Jolie's movie I haven't actually seen it but this was a one of the stills that popped up as well which i think is a beautiful shot obviously fire in the background and all these silhouettes really creative storytelling use of shadows and this bottom one is one of my favorite shots from Sicario which was one he did this shot last for I think a good 20 30 seconds they shot at the end of the day all natural lights and these soldiers just end up walking down to have entered this wash into this valley and they're about sort of go underground fight this battle but he he has this shot sort of Pat if I remember he pans the shot right to left as they saw I start to move down and you just had these silhouettes passing in front of the frame and this beautifully graduated blue hours sky framing them and it creates such an amazing moment with the music as well and and sort of having them move off into combat some really creative uses of storytelling and I think Deakins is an absolute master at using shadows creatively to tell better stories within the frame now you might think that's all very well but photographers obviously can't light like this I think when I started talking about this in the highlights video one of the comments below was this works very well for movies and dark theaters photographers can't light like this well I mean maybe it doesn't need a slight adjustment boom you can absolutely take the the theory behind using shadows like this to create interest and tell stories and your images and I'm going to show you some photographers some well-known photographers and how they do this so this is Constantin Manos here he's using shadows he's not worried about losing detail in his darkest shadows he's using silhouettes he's using shapes again you can't see the detail and in this you can almost lose the detail in the phone box here at the bottom and in this poll but he doesn't mind because it's creating interesting elements in the frame again using shadows and shapes and things cast on too walls to create a bit more of a story ray Metzger really pushes things again black and white you can't see the face can't see faces here you are losing a lot of shadow detail and there's deep shadows here just a sliver of light and highlights on the back and creating a bit of a frame for this bus stop but everything else in the frame is really really dark so the idea that you can't light like this and instills doesn't really hold much weight against so much shadow in this frame filling it and just to highlight on the side here this is actually for those of you who are worried about shooting street photography and the fact that you can't maybe some country that you're living and doesn't allow you to shoot people so they're identifiable in the frame you can get very creative and shoot like this here's another one so lighter beautiful use of color insoles work but again like a lot of shadow a lot of shadow filling the frame to create a lot more interest you can't really see this guy's face just a little bit of highlight on the hair but everything else is creating a lot more mystery when we expose those highlights we can actually embrace the fact that we're losing those shadows and use them creatively to tell better stories Trent Park who's another one of my favorites an Australian photographer again just demonstrates that losing your shadows doesn't mean you've failed you can do it deliberately and you can use them incredibly creatively to to create a sense of drama or storytelling you know when you're starting out in photography you don't have to panic that you are losing details in your shadows you can lose them deliberately as long as you're doing it on purpose and for a reason so you know there's no detail here just a little bit of a highlight on the side there's no detail in this bus here but you can just see a highlight poking out at the top all this details lost no detail in these people no detail in these shadows but it's creating this beautiful light coming through and the silhouette hardly any detail on these people here just this little highlight because he's exposed for that Sun hitting the clouds and the rain as it's coming in and it just shows you that you can in all your work if you choose to use your shadows creatively it doesn't matter that you crunch them down if you're exposing for those highlights you can use them to tell better stories over time I think I've come to realize that shadows are actually what make an image shadows sculpt light they give it its boundaries in its shape whether it's a smooth from light into shadow or a hard line that separates light from shade shadow is what holds light in its place and helps us to see it in other words shadows on our enemies they're our friends shadows can even become characters they can obscure things or hide things they can draw viewers in you can get people to actually lean into an image because they want to see what's in those shadows beyond the tonal range of the camera and they can help us tell richer stories because of it the fact is that cameras today are limited they don't see like our human eye does and we can bemoan that fact we can be upset about that and wish that it was different and they did see like us so we could capture life the way we see it or we can take that limitation that they have and use it creatively to tell better stories in our images [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] I was sitting around the other day and to be brutally honest I was feeling pretty sorry for myself and they did some things which had not gone my way setbacks business things had folded I've got some harsh criticism from a bunch of quarters that that week and I think I mentioned a previous video that my wife's grandmother passed away recently mine passed away a month ago and I had the funeral for that and just a lot of these things were starting to weigh on me but as I was sitting there feeling sorry for myself this this lesson that I'm giving you today that that you have to have shadows to make a decent image or to tell a good story came to my mind and I thought maybe that's true of life as well of all the different religions and traditions that I've read from around the world and I do read a lot of different spiritual alleys because I find it interesting there seems to be this thread that runs through the Mystics of all these traditions that says the only times in our life that we're really growing and changing as human beings are in dark times are in the shadows when when everything is going well we don't have to change ourselves we can just coast and ride and don't have to adjust but when there's a death in the family when a relationship that really matters to us falls apart when we lose a job those are times when we have to assess what we're doing or where we are and take a good look at ourselves and change you see I think we're forged in the shadows and that's not to take away from the fact that when you're in that space it can be incredibly painful and when you can't see a way forward because it's so dark it can be very despairing as well but I think if we throw our vision a little bit wider as if our life is actually a picture that we are creating and exposing for that we need the shadows to shape the light to tell a better story I mean every single stereotypical historical figure that we hold up as as being an example of a life lived well that changed the world a little bit has those deep shadows is mandela mandela without 27 years in jail is gandhi who he was without his fight against the British in India his Martin Luther King who he was without experiencing segregation and racism in the South before we make an excuse to go yeah but look what they did with their lives that turned out so beautiful they didn't feel like that when they were in the shadows when Mandela's sitting in jail I'm sure he never thought that he would actually get out one day I'm sure he assumed he would die there but because he pushed through and let the shadows form him and forge him by the time he got out he was able to paint a beautiful picture with who he was so I think it's a case of taking a look at when those shadows arrive trying to throw out a picture a little bit wider and remind ourselves that this isn't here to stay and that maybe there's an opportunity to tell an amazing story with our life if we keep pushing through we all wish for life is filled with blissful happiness the whole time but the more I think about it I don't think I want that to me it kind of looks like an overexposed piece of film with nothing to say I want to live a life with light and shade and difficult times in good times because I think it will tell a better story and does that mean when those difficult times arrive they'll be easier to take or less painful I don't think so I think they'll still be as painful as ever but I think having that bigger perspective will help get through them because I'll realize again that this isn't the end this is just something to go through and cannot t be used to change me in a good way if I let it so I think I'd say whether it's your photography or your life learn to embrace your shadows make friends with them and use them to tell better stories Tucker to get 10% of your first purchase [Music] [Music]
