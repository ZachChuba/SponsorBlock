This episode of Indy Mogul brought to you
by Epidemic. This I always called the Death Star sequence for Bohemian Rhapsody. Because of this didn't work the film was done. It was over it was a disaster. It's
just amazing how emotional a song like "We Are the Champions" because of context is in this movie it's so emotional it makes you want to cry. What's going on Indy Mogul today I'm here with a legendary editor and composer John Ottman. John
Ottman's amazing he did movies such as "The Usual Suspects" the X-men series,
"Superman Returns", and of course most recently winning the Oscar for "Bohemian
Rhapsody" amazing work and amazing artist here and today we're gonna talk
a little bit about music and editing specifically with the movie "Bohemian
Rhapsody." We got three scenes here that were
picked from our editing team we're gonna go through each one with the editing
with the composing and the story for each of them and walk through of the
scenes you ready for this? Yeah. Let's do this first scene here we go. Okay so this
is the scene of course where Freddie Mercury is first starting to work on
"Bohemian Rhapsody." Right this is where it's sort of it's been ruminating in his
head for quite a while it's one of the favorite scenes in the film because a
lot of it was none scripted and tons of actor improv which makes it real yeah but the
improv necessarily is not put together in any sort of natural order
you'll have an actor they'll come up with a line talking to actors now
they're you know so the editors sort of editorially kind of almost like re-script it out in the editing room and then come up with wild lines as an
answer to someone's off-the-cuff remark or do a pickup whatever and so that's
what the sequence became but it is it's very real because: A, the actors
already have this great chemistry among each other and so they can
play off each other's improvs. Look like this joke that Freddie just gave me that
was never in the script ["You know play it like you wrote it well I did I wrote
that part taking the piss okay."] For this type of scene what drove the pacing? Well
it certainly wasn't music because it's basically they're piecing it together so
it was mainly camaraderie and fun and so I saw that is a great opportunity so if
I could bring the audience on board and how they're getting along with each
other now yeah it'll be even more devastating later when they're not
getting along you know and more snappy could be with their
improv moments you know like that one there. That was the
main thing for me is the more fun we're having the more fun you see them having
with each other yeah the better it's gonna be later for the
story. I knew this had to build and build and build and become crazier and crazier
with the Galileo's you know well this was one of the things I loved doing you
know and so futtsing the the control room mics and so forth and
cradles relationships back and forth. One of the painful parts is when you spent
so much time on the AVID weaving sounds and your relationships between dialogue
and so forth then when you go to the final
the real dub it's like the spool gets unraveled and you spend all that time
just trying to get it back to kind of what you did before you know but
hopefully better you know yeah the improvement of course was putting the
Galileo's and the surrounds and so forth you know the sound design was not that
extensive compared to like an x-men movie or something you know um but still
this was one of those few scenes where I could do stuff like that. Alrighty so
moving on this is the we will rock you seen the movie. Yeah this was one of the
few musical sequences that still tells a story because it's been set up that
Brian May has this idea about including the audience and that's what Queen
really was all about but I didn't really do a montage of external things it's
basically all we will rock you. The agony of doing this scenes is I knew you know
it has to be amazing and has to you know you want people-- People are coming to
the theater for this scene. There are people that are coming for this. Exactly so I cut the
whole thing together the concert that's coming up you know and it was cool
snazzy and I had the second unit go shoot the other foot stamping and all
that kind of stuff but this scene hadn't been shot yet and so I had the whole
thing cut together my little vignettes of Freddy in the dark and all that stuff
and then they shot this I'm like oh I need to integrate some of this so you
have to have objectivity in your own work and where where what I had
created was really good but it was better when I integrated stuff
from the previous scene and so there's these little moments like right here. And
this helps tell the story like yeah more more, more and so you're integrating the
the setup to the scene with the scene itself that makes this much
more exciting because you know it's it's the the fruition of what his plan was
yeah. We did cut this down here and there the biggest challenge I had to cut
down iconic music yeah that everyone knows and not notice it I mean so that's
really hard if the audience even smelled that it felt like a montage it would
collapse because you had to feel like a real-time experience that you were there
and the moment you didn't feel that it would have it would have been an
absolute disaster but I had to cut ours out you know moments on the music and
find ways of masking it so that even the die-hard cleaned fan wouldn't mind real
quick explain what a bar is of course Oh a bar is another word for is a measure
and you know in music you see all these you see four notes in a one bar and for
now to another bar in this the challenge is making invisible sometimes you know
the the visuals in conjunction with your cut can trick you into buying it you
know but you have to you know when you when you're cutting down the music
course you have to do it on the beat you know and so when I say about cutting
bars or coming measures out you meant to make sure it's musically has musical
integrity by by cutting on the beat and also I had the extra stems tracks of
the song so if for some reasons they did truncate and a melody lines coming in
too fast my people do race that know a lot I know yeah one of my major major
major mantras for the sound people on this movie was again like Brian May
saying audience participation and we were really a little afraid that when we
went doing the final mix that the band would feel freaked out that we were
masking a lot of music by the sounds of the audience yeah but fortunately they
understood they were on board you know because in this scene you got to hear
everyone clapping the moment that you start hearing the audience that's when
it starts working literally as ready as the music is when you just when we just
play the music was boring yeah you know and it's testament to what their plan
was was it works because of the audience before we move on real quick I wanted to
give a huge shout out to epidemic which of your subscription but back to the
episode alright so moving on we're doing of course our last scene for the movie
of the Live Aid concert here this kept me up at night for a year because this
is the first thing we shot it's basically its own little movie it's
telling a story as all these sequences are but this is the ultimate example of
that perhaps the last big moment he gets with this audience that truly loves him
to death you know the brilliance of the movie which is little with little
fudging in the truth is he never really told the band he had AIDS before Live
Aid but brilliance of that is by telling them in this movie prior to this it
makes this even more emotional the challenge with this among where to begin
but challenge of this sequence was designing in such a way where it grew
emotionally his went along this song alone I could have pulled out all the
stops got a billion shots of the audience and you know had it super loud
and but then it would have no place to go you know you just hope people stick
with it long enough to get there like that's gonna get even bigger and bigger
really it is you know yeah attention you're talking yeah he's playing it slow
in the beginning very quiet coverage in the beginning when they walk out and
then it gets huge mm-hmm my first verse is the scene I showed the audience a lot
more in the first couple songs and it was cool but it was 5 million dollars
over budget you know and so I'm like well I'll cut back and
I'll save the audience but it actually so that end up dramatically working
better for the sequence because by staying on stage intimately with them
and sort of building and by the time you're you're at the end I could pay for
even more amazing shots at the end of a more epic one producers Dennis a
Sullivan who was Grant King's right-hand man went out shot out some stuff to cut
too and he very brilliantly shot the bunch of Xers in his bar the best thing
he did was to show the bar empty first and where the few people are watching
live 8 and then more people are in there so that I could crosscut all the people
clapping so for the bar shows that people outside filling up seats engaged
in live 8 it's it's it's a phenomenon it's happening everywhere and that
really helps push the the emotional element of it I was driving the rhythm
in this one not to sound artsy fartsy but it was emotions what dictated how
this got cut you know moments like or an actor moments that you just had to
see on the screen basically yeah there was a push to cut this song in half and
I'm like but but the reprise of the song where it repeats itself
is where becomes too emotional and he gets off that stage and repeats the song
and everyone's singing it's like if you haven't heard that before already it's
never getting of the impact so in a Hail Mary to protect this I took a bazooka
and blew apart another song and cut two and half minutes out of it and when I
listened this is a kid on the radio I never want to cry list and we're the
champion yeah it sounds like I'm beating my chest tough to get to my song but
it's the it's the imagery the shots his performance and the audience and the
context of what this all means for him and if you die it all comes together to
make it so emotional I think I don't think anyone will ever hear the song the
same way again after this movie they were smart to end the concert with
that thank God ha ha well thank you so much for - of course absolutely amazing
editor and composer Jonathan seriously freaking sweet to hear all the kind of
under stories and currents and work think I've got all sorts oh I believe

it's all exposed and it's all about the music where it's a if it's film music or
a score it's underneath that Barry does it sound of fact you know put a big car
explosion where you want to cut the music you know so I mean I'm more the
proponent of that where my music editor is like I can't do that musically
correct like I don't give it it's under a car explosion
