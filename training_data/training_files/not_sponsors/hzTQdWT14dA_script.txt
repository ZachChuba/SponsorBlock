I'm going to call you three times a day
and ask about what you're doing I'm going to like one post a day
So you'll get mixed messages It's not cool to fall for a taken guy I know that too, uh-oh So what's wrong with me
This is so weird I can't help myself I like the smile
When our eyes meet It could almost melt my heart A step and two
As I get closer to you It gets harder to breathe Shubirubirub, please stop me Shubirubirub, I must be out of my mind Shubirubirub, what do I do! Shubirubirub, someone please wake me from this dream I'm going to dress up and go see you
And surprise you Maybe I'll even smile at you
To shake you up a little You must adore that girl next to you It breaks and burns my heart You seem happy, you seem to be in love There's no chance for me I like the smile, when our eyes meet
It could almost melt my heart A step and two, as I get closer to you
It gets harder to breathe Shubirubirub, please stop me Shubirubirub, I must be out of my mind Shubirubirub, what do I do! Shubirubirub, someone please wake me from this dream Crazy, I know This isn't like me I say no, I try to stop But I keep falling for you Should I tell you or not
Oh, I'm feeling dizzy My days are all about you I wonder if you know
Or are you too dull to see I want you to be mine Shubirubirub, please stop me Shubirubirub, I must be out of my mind Shubirubirub, what do I do! Shubirubirub, someone please wake me from this dream
