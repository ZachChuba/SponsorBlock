first of all up in line to y'all and I need to apologize cuz I said that never again on this channel would I review another stylist for the Apple iPad but here I am today I've got one and I'm gonna be reviewing it as you can see here it is the weirdest stylist I have ever seen that looks like there is a rubber band wrapped around it it's not actually a rubber band this is a cord that plugs it into the audio jack of your phone your iPad your Android tablet works on a bunch of different devices it's just so weird I gotta talk about it this video is sponsored by the dot space in the description onto the video so let's take a look at what comes in the Box right here it's gonna tell you that this has pressure sensitivity it has palm rejection there's a shortcut button there's a magnetic pen holder in the box also this doesn't require any batteries which is a nice touch and this is compatible on Android and on iPads and iPhones so that's that's pretty cool around the back it tells you some other information like the court is gonna plug directly into your iPad or Android tablet but your device is going to need an audio port a little headphone jack port so the new iPads any kind of phones that do not have an audio jack this isn't going to work with those also it talks about the pen holder part how that works and there's some replacement nibs in here too so let's open this thing up and let's take a look at what we have so I'm just set the box back there oh looks like these are our instructions yep these are our instructions that tell you how to connect it to various apps so that's gonna come in handy here we've got a space or something I don't know what this is this must be the pen holder and obviously this is what we're gonna spend most of our time looking at this is our pen now as you can see something that's really worth pointing out that's probably going to turn some people off is this a disk tip it is not like a normal pencil tip it's got this disk tip and I'm curious to see what that does to the accuracy as we're using the stylus to write and draw also we have our cord here I got the blue cord comes in a bunch of different colors I like the blue best a nice little pull tab it makes it easy to take off and then we just have to there we go get it off the pen it's not that hard I think I'm making this harder than it is there we go and there's our cord so let's find a device I have an iPad Mini here which has a nice headphone jack for me let's plug this in and see what it does and while I'm plugging this in I want to tell you a couple things about this first of all it's up to the app manufacturers to actually implement this stylus that's really important because it doesn't look like many people have so like procreate does not have the ability to use the smart features from the stylus I can still come in here and I can still draw with the stylus I don't get any pressure sensitivity I don't get the palm rejection I don't get any of the benefits that you would expect from a smart stylus so this is the same thing as buying a couple dollars stylus off of Amazon or something like hearing me because none of the cool features are working one app that does probably my favorite app that does is art studio Pro that does support this device let me take a look really quick on their website to see what other devices this supports flip a clip which is an animation app many bang it supports Medibank it supports I bez paint hard Studio Pro which is what I'm gonna be playing with here and then a couple other notes apps you know annotating pdfs and things like that so that's about it if you're really curious definitely check out the website before you go but this does not this is not supported by many artists because it is up to the app manufacturer to support this pen and I guess a lot of them at this point have chosen not to so let's go ahead let's boot up art studio and let's take a look at the basics here the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to go over here and I'm going to go to my preference to make sure that the pen is actually going to connect there we go scroll down here to connect so in our pen can did good so let's take a look at the basics of this pen first thing I want to take a look at is the accuracy how easy is it to close shapes and it's actually pretty easy to close shapes that was one of the things that surprised me when I first started using this is how accurate it is even though I tend not to like these discs tip styluses this one works pretty pretty well and I kind of like using it one thing that I have noticed is palm rejection is it's not good it says it's okay but it's really not it's kind of hit or miss I'm not getting a lot of zooming in and out when I my palm is on there but the lines are acting kind of funky so that's kind of unfortunate let me undo some of these lines here really quickly the next thing I want to take a look at is the pressure sensitivity so I'll start by pressing really hard and then maybe I'll go a little bit lighter and then I'll go harder now one of the reasons it's hard to see any difference and I can see a difference it's definitely thicker over here and thinner over here but one of the problems here is that it's hard to find a pen to test pressure with in art studio that's one of the reasons I use procreate over this is because I get more flexibility I use pressure a lot in my work to get thicker and thinner lines and trying with the pen tool that's really thick thin now let's not show me anything let's change the size thicker thinner yeah I'm not I'm not seen a whole bunch of difference in the pressure here and I'm gonna be testing this out against the Apple pencil and I think that's going to give us a much better idea of how the pressure works and how this thing works out so let me set that up so for the drawing on the left I'm going to be using the sonar pen and for the drawing on the right I'm gonna be using the Apple pencil so let me grab my pencil or I should say the the inking brush that I've chosen and played around with a little bit feeling pretty comfortable with yeah that's the one bit bigger there we go and I'm gonna speed through this so you can see how this works and then I'm gonna shift over to the Apple pencil and we'll see how that works let's do this you alright so that was the sonar pen now I'm going to unplug this I'm gonna set up my Apple pencil yes and I'm gonna make sure that this thing is paired up and we're gonna see how this all works with our Apple pencil you all right so there we go there's my test I'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna turn off my pencil layers just to give us a better idea of what we're dealing with here and there's a couple things I noticed one I think my palm made some dots when I was using the Apple pencil which is kind of interesting but outside of those couple dots I think the Apple pencil dramatically outperformed the sonar pen and there's a couple key things that I wanted to zoom in on here the first is it was much easier for me to make a light line whoops let me turn on my layers real quick it's much easier for me to make a light line with this than it is with the sonar pen the levels of pressure in this feel way way better and they feel way way more responsive and I could see that the most like on lines like this where I could start off thicker and kind of get thinner and then get thicker and Here I am I'm just connecting my sonar pen going back here and I'm gonna try the same thing here if I go thick okay it thinks I'm moving in hold on let's try this again if we go thick and then thin and then thick again you can see it's not varying that much especially compared to the Apple pencil the other thing I'm seeing on a lot of these lines are the starting points it seems to take a second before that starting point begins I can see it right here I'm going to point to it with my pencil it starts off thin and it starts off a little late this starts off thin and starts off a little late I could definitely see it in these fast hatch lines starting most of these I tried to start on the black and move over it was much easier much more consistent to do this with the Apple pencil over here but I see those kind of strokes all over the place you could tell where I started this line and started this line it just doesn't really I can tell that it's picking up pressure it's just not picking it up well at all you also probably noticed as I was drawing the palm rejection with this isn't too good now the Apple pencil left some palm prints right here so that is definitely worth noting but this every so often it would try to think I was trying to zoom in and out that's frustrating several times my pick the color over here little things like that happen and the funny thing about palm rejection is that even if it works 90% of the time that's just not good enough so I'm gonna open up Medibank cuz that's the other iPad app that this works with here we go and now that many bang is open let me make sure that these stylus is actually connected here all right so my sonar pen is connected so I'm gonna go ahead and close that I just have a normal pen hopefully this works heavy line thinner line heavy line so I can definitely pick up the pressure sensitivity way better I'm Eddie bang that I cut over an art flow let's try something I'm going to try making a line here and let me see about the start and end point of lines what I do quick hatch lines so I'm trying to start on that line and it seems to be doing better here so I bet a lot of the performance of this pen and how this pen works is really dependent on the app makers to implement it properly and I've heard that from other pens that I've reviewed as well and unfortunately that doesn't really help us as the end user at the end of the day I don't really care whose job it is to make a pen work but if the manufacturer makes the hardware and the people who make the software have to work together it makes it that much harder to make a good product so overall I'm giving this mixed reviews the other thing I noticed is that this core does tend to get in the way obviously drawing without a chord is much much better but but overall this pen has performed better than I expected it to but I'm still I'm still definitely going with the Apple pencil here let's try this thing out on some Android apps see how it does there so here we have the Galaxy Tab s for this thing came out last year it's a really nice Android tablet even though the new one has just been announced the s6 gonna be reviewing that soon this came with a pen this this uses Wacom's own tech inside the pen so this actually is a very nice pen I'd say it's comparable to the Apple pencil not quite as good palm recognition isn't quite as good but in terms of just drawing experience this is really good you know laying down those heavy lines and then thinner lines I can get a really nice variation here you can clearly see where the thinner lines are where the thicker line is so this is a this is a very nice pen it performs well let's plug in our sonar pen and let's see how this does and while I am plugging this in I do want to talk about this a little bit it works on even fewer Android apps then it works on iPhone iOS apps this app here is called art flow studio is one of the better Android apps out there for drawing and painting I really like it a lot fortunately it works really well with this app there is an extra plugin you do have to download in order to make it work it does not work with Medibank paint on Android but it does work in I bez paint X so if you're interested in that that's gonna work but really those are the only two like drawing painting Android apps that you get as I beds and this art flow those are the only two apps that actually have support for this pen so let's see how this is going to do with a heavy line and thinner line heavy line and thinner line and this is so much better than what we were seeing over on the iPad this actually looked comparable that Wacom pen now one thing I will note and you're probably seeing it here you're seeing some wobble I don't think that's the fault of the pen as much as it's the fault of my hand one of the problems here is that this tip is really really slick when I was using it on my iPad what was happening is that I have a screen protector on this thing I don't know if you could see kind of the matte surface of my screen protector which makes it really nice to draw on I don't have a screen protector on this it's really slick and one of the things that this pen does really well is it gets me a little bit of a resistance it's got a little bit of a rubbery tip to it because this has so much surface area it's hard to get a nice smooth line and I don't know oh that's the other thing is that this cord oh this is frustrated this cord can draw a line so when you're drawing your cord is going to hit this thing and the court is going to leave extra lines and like there the cord might also make your your tablet zoom in and out which is really pretty frustrating so if you were gonna use something like this I probably would check out a screen protector because that's going to give you you know a lot better more confident lines easier to kind of check those things it does come it says here on the box that replacement nib for a brand new drawing experience where's that box let's say there is let's check this out I want to see how different this drawing experience is on a slick screen like this because that's gonna probably make all the difference in the world all right so here's the here's the new nib it looks just like the old nibs so I'm gonna take the old nip out gonna set it there I'm going to pop in the new nib okay I can't tell the difference but that's probably because there was like a minute in between I'll do this real quick then I'll be able to tell the difference and I'll know which one's better okay that feels identical to me this has absolutely no difference a lot although a lot that's still really slick that is still really slick there's no difference between these two nibs all right maybe there is I can't okay so I can't tell the difference between this brand new drawing experience here that I just installed in my tip but I got to take the word for it that there's some difference maybe I just can't tell on the surface of this device here's here's kind of my take on this thing first this thing is way more accurate than I expected it to be and to be honest with you at first the disk tip really threw me for a loop however after using it for a little bit I've kind of gotten used to it it's not as bad as I first thought it would be palm rejection I did it's not good don't if you get one of these do not expect it to have any kind of palm rejection as far as the pressure goes it really depends on the app maker in order to implement that properly maybe it's one of those things within art flow I think I can go in there and I can play with the pressure curve but expect to do some fiddling and expect to do some things with this to get it to just feel like a normal like pressure-sensitive smart stylus lastly the chord I am not at all a fan of the chord but again you're only gonna be paying $35 for this as opposed to you know $100 for an Apple pencil I think if you have a newer iPad you're probably just gonna want to go with an Apple pencil I know it costs more but it's so much nicer it is totally worth it if you have an older iPad this might be worth checking out so I'll link to down below so if you do want to check it out you can grab that link and if you use this let me know down below what do you think are you still happy with the purchase would you recommend it to a friend let me know down below in the comments thank you guys for watching I appreciate it and I'll talk to you in a couple of days [Music]
