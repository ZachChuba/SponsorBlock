Hello. This is Solarsido Solar. Today, continuing on from last year Since it's June I prepared a Memorial Month special. I also prepared a video for Memorial Month last year.
[<- Went to the War Memorial of Korea] This time, I'm trying a custom shoe making challenge. So first, I bought some new shoes. [Today's supplies]
[Every kind of sign pen] [Today's supplies]
[New shoes (bought with my money)] I'm going to put in my patriotism and make it.
[Custom theme = patriotism] Let's get to it right away~ Shoes, unboxing. [Unboxing has started, unboxing has ended] There are a lot of people who do
really high quality custom shoes. [Cusfantom, Vans X Hunminjeongeum (Korean script)] Many Yongwangnims-
Well, people who know already know... I really have poop (unskilled) hands. But, there are those things. I'm not good with my hands. But, I like doing things! I've made some and worn them. Made and gifted some to Colleague 1 as well. And IU sunbaenim... We were a guest at one of her concert And, I drew some then, too, and gave it to her. Anyway, I prepared a shoe making challenge today. [Measuring the angle] (Carefully.....) (Here I go.....) [Four gwe (stripes on the Korean flag) embodied] [Taegeuk mark] I'm going to use blue
and red as the dominant colors. (How to do the design...) (Scratch scratch) [Creative circuit stopped] I can't start it. [Ambitious first design] 'I love Korea'. (Poop smell sensed on her own as well...) [You're watching the process of Solar's patriotism making Memorial Month edition custom shoes] [Stuck on the next design] [Thinking person.mov] What is there?x3 (Ideas rise) Creations are this hard to do. Art is difficult. [Not drunk] (Drawing something) Like a ghost wearing a scarf... No... (Throw) Ah... [Artist in agony] No no, it's not it, it's not it!
[Anguished artist] [Devastated artist] Do you have any ideas?
[Eventually requested SOS] Look once. - It's cute, right?
- (Savior appears) Yeah. I'm going to draw a Rose of Sharon. [Boldly drawing] (Sensed poop smell again)
This is failed. [Boldly failed] Eliminated. I'm going to look at this and draw it. - I drew it well, right?
- (Big Yong unnie) Uh. Nono. (Big Yong unnie) Start with red inside. - Start with red and do it with pink?
- No, start with red inside. (Big Yong unnie) Go long~ Like this? (Big Yong unnie) That's too long, about half.
Like you're scribbling. (OK received) Oh? It's pretty! [Cute Rose of Sharon] I'm a bit surprised. (Big Yong's coaching)
Ah, on the inside? Slightly, just so you can see the color. (Focused) [Gasp] It's so pretty? Perfect~ (Big Yong unnie) I think you need to do it well here. (Big Yong unnie) Cute~~~ (Big Yong also sensed poop smell)
It's really cute when you really can't do something. (What are you talking about) I did really well right now. Oh my, it's so pretty, oh my.
[Self-admiration] Wow, my hands can do this much? [Poop hands lost it's roots and has developed] So pretty. Wow, I drew this really well. Even though I drew it. I'm a bit surprised. (Lastly, tie shoelaces) Splash into the Rose of Sharon~ (Subscribe, like) For the first time on Solarsido It was a really quiet challenge. It was a quiet video. [My patriotism] has come this far, our Yongwangnims. I worked hard making this But, I have real poop (untalented) hands. Of course, it could be a bit... In reality, I'm going to wear the shoes that I made. I did discuss giving them to Yongwangnims, too. But, it's known that I have poop (untalented) hands So there were opinions like, 'Wouldn't it be
better if you wear them yourself?' I really respect everyone's preferences. Today's challenge. As a Memorial Month special I did a challenge making shoes of my own. It could be a bit of a loss (ㅠㅠ) But it's a meaningful special video So I hope you enjoy watching it. Alright then, I will return again with a great challenge. Bye~ (Subscribe, like) To explain these a bit. I drew three Rose of Sharons. I tried drawing- writing Hunminjeongeum (Korean script) On either side, I tried decorating it. 'I love Korea', 'Yes!' 'Good', 'Me too' 'Leggo' 'Daehan'. It says 'Daehan'. On the right shoe, like this. I drew one big Rose of Sharon. 'I love Korea', 'I love people' 'This is the strength of the Red Devils'.
(S.Korean national football team support group/fans' name) These are Red Devils. And here 'Minguk' is written. Here Searching the internet... I wasn't sure what to write, so I searched online. I wrote this. ['Let's remember together. Republic of Korea that was protected with their lives. Let's protect it well with our lives'.] 'Proud of our country' I also colored this part red. The thing I like the most is... The Rose of Sharon. I'm really satisfied. It feels like I drew it really well? Gratefullly... Even though I made them. I will wear them gratefully. Ta-da~ I wore the shoes today. The Rose of Sharons are bright, right? I'm good at driving. Push it? I pushed it. [Subtitles by ch0sshi, LilySUBS]
