you guys asked for again saya recently have become the queen of posing on the Internet I don't even know how it happened because I'm not a professional so today I'm gonna be going through your photos again I'm critiquing them the ones that you sent through and there's a lot of them but please take this with a grain of salt because I'm pretty sure that professional models watching right now are probably appalled at you device I'm about to give you a few things will always stand sure I'll go through them really really quickly engage your core take off your glasses unless you know what you're doing with a reflection because sometimes when you photograph with glasses the reflection makes you lose your eyes and it's hard to connect with a photograph when you have no eyeballs make sure that you shoot a little bit lower down because these photographs for example they're all shot slightly from above and you can see the proportions of these women's bodies are kind of skewed because now their heads and the torso looks bigger and their legs look tiny so just take the camera down and shoot it from lower ladies and gentleman punch of toes knees just point your toe it's no big deal or anything but I had a professional mermaid submit a photo to me to critique her poses as well I had nothing to say about it persons because they're so beautiful however she sent me this photo through and I just really couldn't help myself I wanted to edit it because I thought it was just like lacking the punching colors so I edited it and I made a preset out of it and now I've linked it below if you guys want it in the description for you to access the free preset I also use this preset on this photo and I turn out pretty cool so it is a universal ghost for a lot of photos enjoy committing to a photograph is probably the biggest thing that will make or break a photograph I see this over and over again all of these photos I know that they're like 80 percent bit you guys are almost committing but a part of me is like I don't know if you're gonna be taking the photos might as well commit let loose surrender into the process of creating art just let go of what you should do how you should act and just get into the form of I pose however you feel like in the moment surreal relaxed all of this I'm just really feeling myself right now most of us get extremely nervous in front of photos so we go into the shine mode which is like pulling your shoulders forward like Oh am i doing the right thing own it shoulders back which girl u smade right here this is the best photo look how much fun you're having I love this photo it is not specifically following any poses but your expression on your face is so genuine you are just so engulfing in this photo so bring those emotions to the photographs really great my bad even for myself [Music] photographs that you're taking me to either make a lot of sense or no sense at all this is where the crazy art stuff comes in which is fine too and I love it I'm getting more into this myself in the make sense category you have to kind of abide by a few rules let me kind of explain okay this photograph oh girl slang beautiful good pose pretty gangsta so no gang stuff oh girl why are you holding this pole it makes no sense feet but it makes me sense but y'all hold onto it just let go I can almost guarantee the photo would have been better sometimes we just search shy we just like latch onto things let go relax do things that make sense this photograph I just want to point it out maybe you're doing some purpose obviously these photos are associated with more like seductive imagery for guys whenever you put like glasses or a pencil in your mouth and like tilt down and like kind of shy away we've seen this representation this pose in like millions of photographs for seduction and like schoolgirls or sexy secretary which is fine I mean I send those photos to my boyfriend all of the time am i right if you're gonna do this pose if you're gonna go all out you might as well get into your knickers get into your bra and real push it if you want to go down that way but if this is just for the general like pressing stock to play your friends and family Jesse oh whether is a connotation with this kind of pose with you know love this awesome outfit great background as a sweet that's awesome the thing that doesn't make sense to me is that us sitting and honest sweet and you're not enjoying yourself it's either you really commit to being like holy [ __ ] I'm gonna swing this is so fun and really push that John expression a big smile on your face or are you going to like the high-fashion look like staring out into the distance or the giant contrast is you get on this swing and you're extremely upset and people will be like why is she extremely upset she's on a swing you just have to commit to an emotion because the image kind of lost its punch when you lost the expression there's nothing really going on in your face yet I haven't got any purpose behind it I've got a fluff on my finger what's attached by that's my trainer cup okay Oh Sorella where are your earrings that was lame the photographer submitted these photos not sure if I'm allowed to publicly show these girls images don't know if I got permission so let's look that out but the leg stance okay well this one probably the legs are a little bit too wide it just kind of looks kind of strange to bring the legs in a little bit which you've done in this butter so well done to you I love these photos from me honest they are at do but I specifically love this I'm really mesmerizing and capturing so well done to you for finding a cute little niche man but with a twist of like purples and flowers and stuff I love what you're doing sir please keep going say what this image is like bordering on storytelling it's very interesting there's something going on it's different like it's captivating so push the storytelling what I'm trying to say with your image so well done to this image as well much better 29 year old woman I'm allowed I have these but guess what I don't care so I'd do it anyway ankles I love how many of you now are always pointing out on my photographs the angle is that I'm using or tagging me in your own photos to show me the angles that you're doing in your photos because you love that tip that I gave you so for this babe it's all about those angles right now I feel like if she got off that little window silly thing I don't know what that is it would be more flattering which she has done well done to you however if you wanted to sit in this pose I would switch your legs so the back line goes down and the front one comes up because right now it just looked very uncomfortable and I guarantee if you switched your legs and had the front one bent it would make all the difference in the world Sam sent me these photos through and she said that her I whenever she smiles the right one shrinks a little bit and looks like really sweet and stuff this is an example of self-criticism because I looked at these photos a million times and try to see what she was talking about and I can't your smile is beautiful your eye is perfect there is nothing to worry about but I think we are always so critical of ourselves we amplify things that we see that others have no idea what you're talking about and that's just a good reminder if you're focusing on something in your poses or in your body or in your eyes or in any expression probably just you people probably can't see it so let go of that and just embrace the whole picture of yourself as a whole no one is gonna be like wait that's a beautiful photo why is weird like it just doesn't happen it is all in our minds and I do know
