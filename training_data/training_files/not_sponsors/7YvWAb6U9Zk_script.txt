do you ever wake up like a zombie it's the worst and in my experience those mornings are much more frequent in winter when it's extra dark so what if i can make a device that makes my bedroom brighter before my alarm rings to to prepare my body for waking up let's call it something like some be gone it's a lamp i'm making a lamp except dimming lamp though lamp needs to be able to evenly distribute light across my entire bedroom though and i have an idea and how we can make this interesting if you've ever watched the diy perks video you probably have a fair grasp of the internal components of an lcd screen by now i think we can reuse some of those internals from a broken screen to get this light diffusion that i'm after okay i kind of know because diy prick's already done it and it's made of tutorial and it's up there but we're gonna do it anyway because this is different right the reason why broken lcd displays are so great at being repurposed for light diffusion is that well apart from driving the lcd screen itself its sole purpose is to create a nice and uniform backlight using something like this it's literally designed for our use case the backlighting section has a nice and sturdy metal frame that we can easily fit some led strips into it's got this chunky piece of plastic with some engravings that will spread the light across the whole surface here it's got some of these diffusion layers and also a few layers of some really cool optics that gives the illusion of depth in the light so this is really quite simple one design a pcb that can dim some leds using pulse width modulation which sounds an awful lot like another pcb i recently made for another project on this channel called fetch the world's largest firefly display check it out if you haven't to get these pcbs manufactured and assembled by today's sponsor pcb way all the hard parts are taken care of all you need to do is to 3d print some parts assemble them it's all done easy right wrong okay okay okay okay let's not get ahead of ourselves because as usual i managed to screw up the pcb design slightly i told pcb hue to mount this component on this pad they responded hey this is not gonna work and i said to them oh really your machines can't do this okay no disrespect to pcb way they did a great job the you see right there is just me being way too cheap to buy a new appropriately sized component when i have a perfectly functioning one right here i also managed to screw up the power delivery circuitry on this board as well in this case it means that they are doing the nano they have sprinkled across this board can't power up using usb all right let's plug it into the 24 volt power supply that's supposed to power the thing when it's not connected to a computer and then flash it with boot loaders and firmware and all that stuff and now all the hard stuff is done right wrong you know what this is actually where the hard stuff begins because i wanted this thing to look kind of nice i'm planning to use it i'm not going to show it off on youtube and throw it in the trash so i have to sand and prime and sand and prime and sand and prime the 3d printed parts it takes forever it's super boring so i'm not gonna show any of that footage instead let's have a look at me pretending to stand singing a song that i kept repeating in my head for the 20  hours that i used finishing this part i'm still sanding yeah yeah yeah sorry about that but now all the hard stuff is done all right wrong simon from two seconds ago you made a stupid decision with designing these parts which basically makes it possible to assemble one of the biggest pieces in addition to that you tilted the screen 10 degrees without putting anything behind to support it okay let's just ignore that last part about the tilt and instead watch some footage of me attempting to assemble this thing for 30 minutes straight i continued trying to assemble this thing for several hours after that but the camera ran out of memory i considered redesigning the parts and printing out new ones but when i remembered how much time i'd spent sanding and painting these i puked and took out the file filed it down and forced it in place with a hammer instead after all that i sealed it off with hot glue so it can never be removed again and this decision has yet to come bite me in the ass alright the rest of the design was a lot easier to assemble and i honestly think the whole thing came out quite nice but does it work no well actually yes it does work but i just thought more problems would fit the narrative of this story better you know anyway it'll dim the light up over a set period of time to wake you up and you can press the override button to make it a normal reading lamp that can be dimmed with this rotary encoder to design the pcb i use the open source designs of the arduino nano and an adafruit real-time clock module that can keep track of time when it's unplugged from mains i also threw in one of the uln 2803 transistor arrays that we're using fetch which can provide enough current for all of these leds as well as some protection circuitry and that's basically it it even for someone who's never done pcba before like me the cad encode for this project is uploaded to our github so you can check that out if you want to be as miserable as me attempting to assemble this thing there is no way to change the alarm settings apart from flashing new firmware to the microcontroller unless you adapt the design with a new display of some sort now where i plug in this hdmi okay that's a joke i'm not going to connect our fair fluid clock to this thing i was thinking something more like this but i live a routine life and this was really a requirement for me so screw that who doesn't want to wake up at 6 00 a.m every day anyway besides this is just a supplement to an alarm that will prepare your body for the alarm by slowly waking up so it basically won't wake you up by itself and then i figured less complexity is a fair trade-off but how well does this thing actually work i'd say it works great but i'm a bit biased and my girlfriend's not totally convinced so i can't give you a definitive answer her opinion could be influenced by the fact that she thinks this thing looks kind of ugly um but she could also just not feel the effects i'm not sure it could it could be placebo on my end um but as long as i feel less like a zombie in the morning i i call it a win all right everyone you out and thanks to you for watching share this video with your friends until [Music] you
