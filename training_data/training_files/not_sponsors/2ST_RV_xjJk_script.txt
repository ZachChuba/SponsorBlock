get ready to find out what happens when you put a bunch of delicious stuff inside a flank steak i think you could make the general argument that food great food stuffed with something even greater we're taking a flank steak and we're putting in sauteed shiitake mushrooms sauteed red onions goat cheese that has been influenced by the scent of truffle and spinach and rolling it up and grilling it and finishing it and it's gonna be fantastic we're gonna get to the flank in a second first we're gonna get our vegetables going mushrooms onions let's go first up our mushrooms avocado oil chosen of course our shiitakes go in they shrink down a lot and if i have any extra they're going in my breakfast in the morning let those start to soften then right in the middle a little more oil slice red onion we let this start to soften as well each will get a little stir just so they're all getting a little bit of the oil and we'll just watch them it's not going to take too long mushrooms a little longer than the onions we don't need to melt them down to nothing but we want both nicely softened onions are very close to coming off the onions get a little splash of vermouth with a lid lovely that's going to do amazing things let that sit there for a second and after about 30 seconds lid comes off they smell tremendous we'll take them off so they can start to cool we don't want to stuff the flank with super hot stuff and now the mushrooms a little splash of oil a little head of garlic let it start to get fragrant in about 30-45 seconds we can mix and add the one thing that will make them truly tremendous a little whack of butter mix this in wow great smells here folks great smells these guys are done we'll pull the mushrooms off let them start to cool but the pan will come back get a touch of oil and then a big handful of spinach that over the next minute will wilt down just nicely to go in the flank just a light wilt we're not turning this into cream spinach which by the way i love there you go that's enough and here we are there it is it's a beautiful flank state this guy's about two and a quarter pounds for me the ideal flank stake for stuffing is one of relatively even thickness you're never going to get it perfect you can see it gets a little thinner down here this is kind of nice all the way but that's what you want but now here's the important part you must cut it along the side with the grain running back and forth you cut with the grain in this case which is you know not what we say if we were serving this you would take it you would cut across the grain but what we're going to do is we're going to open it up stuff it close it then roll it back up again into a log that will have this grain so when we cut it after we want to be cutting against the grain don't open a flank from the bottom nope from the side the long side and you'll be fine so let's try this shall we using a sharp knife your hand to keep everything steady insert the blade into the flank as parallel to the board as you can and begin to cut come all the way down and see what you've got now as you start to open it up you'll see you've made this beautiful big pocket right here it's like a mouth i want to eat you but we have to open it up more like a book so we'll come up to the top we'll make more cuts here i'm telling you right now this is never a perfect thing to do unless you're like willie the butcher and then maybe you got your skills way down so just take your time i can see i've already got a little rip down here at the bottom but that's all right watch is all we're doing we're cutting through we're cutting through we're cutting through opening opening see i told you it wouldn't be perfect i'm going to end up with this here and that's okay because here's what's going to happen i'm going to spread my guy out a little bit more i could deal with this but now get that piece of fat off now i'm going to take a piece of saran or cling film or cling wrap or whatever the shit's called i never know another little piece here and then using a gift the flat side not the pointy side you're gonna flatten our guy out a little bit more i'll admit i'm used to doing this with a bottle of wine or something it's much easier with the right tool what do they say right tool for the job or something and when you think you have it where you want it you look at it and be happy smile because this is going to be [ __ ] great now we get to stuff it look you could use almost any cheese in this that you want of course some bring more flavor than others we've done this before i'm using a little tube tube pack a chub chub i'm using a little chub a 5.4 ounce chub of truffle goat cheese you either like truffle or you don't if you don't but you like goat cheese buy goat cheese like this or buy the herb garlic goat cheese like this or use cream cheese or use slices of provolone this is going to work well for me the idea that i've got the creamy of the goat cheese but with the truffle and the steak that's a beautiful combination so let's lay some of this down and then start to add to it so i just want a nice coating all the way across this guy easiest way to do it i'm finding is just let it flake or break it up with your hands like this spread it out evenly it's going to melt in here so have to worry i'm getting that truffle smell right here and honestly i've really done like nothing else to this thing all right next up everything else next up shiitakes this is beautiful or what the onions and finally the spinach i think we're there okay next a little seasoning we're definitely seasoning the outside but right now this will get just some salt and pepper and now we roll here's what we're gonna do just like a cuban cigar roller nice and tight all the way wow that's quite a roll and now we tie all right so we're going to take a piece of string and we're going to tie just like this for you and the easy way to do it is just make like three or four loops one two three and then when you pull tight it stays you don't have to worry about putting a finger there you not and you cut off and repeat i can see my rip is going to be bringing me freaking grief oh it seems to be the theme of the show great food never done easy the last one we'll do so you can watch and see how this debacle is going to turn out i can promise you one thing what's happening here with flavors is going to be fantastic what's happening here with the shape is something else all right we're there should we roll it over and see what's happened this side looks alright i think i can deal with this i really think i can deal with this all right just let me give it a little a little wipey white right here and then we do this and then the kid gets a little oil on both sides and a good dose of our seasoning turn them this is going to be the problem side there's always a problem side i have three sons one's a problem son which one's that you well that seems to be it uh i'm actually gonna go to the bathroom maybe you didn't need to know that then we're going on the grill set up for two stage grilling hot side not hot side direct heat not direct heat sear it around let it finish take it off do things to it eat it go home watch billions have a cocktail day's almost over so we take our chubby little stuffed friend and we put him i'm guessing it's him right on the grill and we're looking for color here we're not looking to cook we're looking to give it a good sear get some pretty marks on this let's see how we're doing here yep what do we got we got sticking but we're gonna be okay it's round but uh we'll make it like it's got actual sides on it color it up all the way around okay look i'm i'm i'm losing i'm losing a couple mushrooms the odd onion a little bit of truffle goat cheese but i'm telling you in the end we're all going to be very happy especially those of us who get to eat this now we just move our chubby little friend to the indirect side and close the lid and there we are look at our little buddy look at our little buddy one thing left to do when we get him off and here we are hi buddy get a load of this guy i like looking right there at that part that's gorgeous but we don't want to cut like that we want to cut across remember we put the pocket in a certain way so that when we cut them we'd be cutting against the grain and that's always the right thing to do the way i like to do this is you cut in between the strings like this those are your little portions right makes it nice and easy so we shall right here our first cut how's it look it's pretty isn't it perfect who wouldn't want to be served that maxi i'm gonna finish right i mean these are just like beautiful medium rare lovely and gorgeous oh come on come on guys do you see what's happened here to see how amazing this is and all i really want is a bite max let's have a bite but now i get to have some and i think i'm just gonna just cut myself a bite right is that the right thing max yeah hmm i don't really know how to do this oh god god god god god it's a mess probably a fork would be a good thing but look at the layers in here it's about the least elegant thing i could be doing right now eating with my hands but so here's the first thing the goat cheese and the truffle are unbelievable with the steak unbelievable but the whole thing is just this tremendous level of we say moisture anymore is that still a word moisture because of the vegetables on the inside mushrooms spinach so good would you make this i would certainly make it again and when these two lads have it they will be asking for it to be made again and let your imagination go put anything you want remember the bacon jam remember the bacon jam [ __ ] yeah the bacon onion jam that could have gone in this it would have been good all right thanks for hanging watching subscribing liking telling your friends and a a brief commercial if you're waiting for a knife if you're
