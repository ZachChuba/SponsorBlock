hope you guys love it let's get to it so hey yeah yeah i know thanks for thanks for coming through um hey uh i just wanted to talk to you uh for a minute um no no no no there's there's no practice today um i just wanted to go over some stuff with you specifically and don't feel weird about it i'm gonna be doing this one-on-one with uh with everybody all right so don't feel weird about it but um i just wanted to kind of connect with you go over some stuff and and kind of talk to you about this season okay so um how you doing okay nice in our classes nice okay okay nice i mean you know that you got to keep the gpa up to play right okay all right just making sure um so what i want to talk to you about today is the team that we're putting together all right now we already had tryouts and you know all of us all those cultures that were there we took notes on each player of course you know you remember how um everything went went so what i wanted to talk to you about today is just kind of what we're looking for in a team and then and then also just kind of like you know what what you think you can offer you know just i'm just just trying to get you know um your your vibe and what you want to get out of this and then and then talk about expectations uh if you were to be a part of the team okay so i'm gonna start with uh we do want you to be a part of the team all right so congrats on that okay um as far as i could tell uh you were third base right okay perfect i actually played uh third base all through high school so that's uh you know that's right up my right up my alley of course i'm the head coach now but um you know well you and i will we'll talk we'll talk so a couple things that i wanted to go over is um do you have any interest in playing any other positions um outside of third okay okay possibly pitching okay have you pitched before sure sure okay um do you what if you were to pitch um just out of curiosity what pitches do you have yeah so okay fastball okay slider oh little slider okay a change okay so fastball uh slider change up okay and a curve okay all right well um we can we can certainly try you out we we have not uh put together our pitching staff yet i will say though that uh you know we have quite a stacked team um so do you want to go over the team real quick sure yeah uh let me let me put this stuff down and uh and grab grab the roster so far and we can kind of go through it and see where we think you would fit okay great i'll show you the roster that we have so far no one by the way has seen this yet um so don't uh you know keep this keep this between us this is this is of course uh uh you know just just to show you what we're working with and where i think um you may fit okay so as you can tell with what i'm gonna show you we have a stacked ace beyond stack roster like we're definitely winning state this year i'm just gonna be honest with you we're winning it like this is the most stacked roster ever okay there are a lot of people who deserve to be on this list but of course nine positions you know how it goes so here is the roster so far okay and as you can see i mean this is just unbelievably stacked you know what i mean you got aob and you know all these people i'm sure um if you do not just check them out that's what you gotta do um lead off alb you got sleigh you got gb you got rafi sharon taylor friv ben and karuna and i mean that's i mean that is that is a stacked roster so where i think that you fit in here could be obviously playing third um where in your in your past you know if you did little league or uh you know major juniors um where in the batting order did you usually hit yeah okay okay so um yeah i mean when i was when i when i played throughout high school i started at third um i batted fourth so that sounds about right um so let's work i'm going to work on i'll line up really quick as you can see again i have the stacked roster uh already so um yeah let's let's see what i can do so if you're here right okay and let's put you okay and would you be open to batting man let's look here i mean alb clearly lead off i mean slight gb raffi sharon yeah i mean i mean man we just have such a great roster where do you see yourself fitting in here because you know we definitely want you on the team um but again like you know i don't have to i don't have to reiterate too much just like how absolute stacked this roster is you know what i mean so um let me ask you this let me ask you this would you be opposed to being on the team and not starting okay sure sure i understand that i and look the best player is going to play okay so if you show that you are ready for the big time you're going to play okay well look um how about this let's let's let's let's let's let's just say that you are on the team so congrats okay absolutely congrats you made the team and uh let's just do this go home tonight and and really think about what you think you can offer to the
