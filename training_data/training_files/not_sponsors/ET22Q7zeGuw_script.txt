well i've got something very special for you today joining me the man the myth the legend caveman gem mr james pryor is here with me to talk about all things risk five and sci-fi well saw all things cy5 and then risk five would be under that umbrella i suppose so uh if you've been living under a rock uh you know risk five is taking the semiconductor industry by storm but i think i think uh mr james pryor could probably tell you you know a better blurb than i can so what you know what's what's uh what's sci five and risk five for the uninitiated yeah sure sir thanks when i really appreciate you making the time happy to talk to you guys get some questions so uh risk five sci five what's happening here is about ten years ago a group of students at a berkeley computer science lab needed to prototype some different designs and they needed an instruction set architecture that was flexible and open didn't require large amounts of licensing fees etcetera yada yada and there wasn't one so being those innovative kind of guys that they are they just up and built one and five years later they found themselves in the position of like hey there's something really to do there so they founded a company called it sci-five and now you have the risk five international organization which is an open standards organization comprised of technology company members as well as individual contributors that guide the development and extensions of risk five as an isa and sci five who are out there building cool micro architectures and platforms and solutions for our partners and customers now i'm only a lowly internet bozo like like not even a computer janitor and i could you know i'm i'll be the first one to tell you that i don't have uh a super deep understanding of of any of the stuff that's in play but one of the reasons for me uh that's exciting with with risk five is that it's sort of it feels like modern tooling on what is a very like computers are new but they're also ancient and so like how we were doing computers in the 70s feels like how we're doing computers in like you know watches and and embedded systems and stuff like that and the thing that that is really awesome about the the risk 5 development kit that i got i think last year um is that it feels like it's a lot of a lot of the learnings of modern computer science are in that versus when you work on some other stuff it's like wow they've really bolted on some sanity into what is fundamentally it's like we just didn't know any better it's like we didn't know we needed indoor plumbing we didn't we didn't know we shouldn't you know poop in the streets but now we know let's let's design something that's that's a little bit uh a little bit less arcane than that and that's what risk five is so it's got to be really exciting yeah a very exciting time i love your analogy of proprietary isis is pooping in the streets by being a scalable model of clean hygiene for everyone but it's yeah risk five is based around the premise that the most important interface in the machine is the interface between the software and the hardware so how do the two talk to each other is an incredibly important part of any computer machine design and what risk five does is kind of add lightness so you start with this very lightweight 60 or so instructions of the core fundamentals that you need to build uh some kind of device that can be called a computer and then add on the bits and pieces that you need for your specific application so if you look at um you know how the industry is progressing right now it's very much focused on kind of a there's a cambrian explosion as uh dave patterson puts it of ai and other kinds of chips right so what's happening there is the general purpose processing uh has has proven to be very very useful and got us to this point but now if we're going to significantly advance in terms of performance energy efficiency workload efficiency capabilities we need to get really workload focused and for sci-fi that's the opportunity right is building the the workload focus platforms using risk five at its heart because it allows us to be very nimble and we've got some other secret source things that we do for our architecture style of designs that let us be very scalable and configurable so in wrist five as a base i isa you've got the extensibility of different extensions so you can add on if you want to have you know different things like vector processing or you know deep math functions or even just picking out some of the base things you need for an application processing core versus an embedded core so all of those things are optional which gives you a very lean base which means everybody can pick out what you need so a lot of advantages there the open nature means that it's auditable it's extensible you don't have to you know guess what's inside of it an extra makes security easier to achieve because you don't have a whole bunch of extra instructions microcode etc that are you know for other people's systems but you have to have because you're using the same thing so from a technical perspective a lot of advantages and you can imagine from using fewer instructions and simplifying your design you can use less area make sure it keeps easy chips easier to manufacture and that obviously helps with the cost of improving performance and everything else so that does you know at a basic level uh really rounds out why risk five is seeing its moment right now so in the in the past you know i would be going reaching back all the way into the 80s some of the imagery that was bouncing around my head as you were talking was things like okay we're going to have a you know this standard microprocessor in this thing from the 80s but we're going to wire it into this bus or this particular device or this other device but the uh the drive it sounds like the drive on the costs of manufacturing the lower the cost of manufacturing and this kind of thing is really driving the same kind of packaging that was happening in the 80s is now just all happening on chip and it's like you you get one piece of silicon so you can go i think you guys have a thing on the online where you go on the store it's like okay i'm starting with the risk five you know base starter and then you've got this sort of wonderful marketplace of awesome stuff that you can just sort of it's like okay this vendor has this that i can bolt on and this that i can bolt on and this that i can bolt on and you literally have a fully assembled piece of silicon that has a lot of intellectual property in it but you've put it together all in one package instead of having to assemble you know the whole micro electronics thing yeah that's a very good visualization because gone are the days where you have big fat cpu core and some cache and then you've got a memory controller and a bus interface and that's your chip and everything else plugs in outside of it right we've now got multi-core we've got custom function acceleration whether it's audio encode or video decode or some kind of ai acceleration or if it's something completely different you know a an image processing unit there's all kinds of funky new cores getting put together as well as controllers as well as interfaces and buses and fabrics and all these things can be built you know with proprietary even self-made architectures but using a single common architecture gives you a lot more scalability you can find more engineers that can work on your stuff and then you can also repeat use existing technology and you know every software developer knows that proven code copy and pasted works way better than brand new every single time so you there's a lot of ways to improve the quality especially as you're getting into billions of transistors you've got to worry about these kinds of hand-placed fine-tuned designs it's just not scalable so yeah there's uh we have a concept at sci-5 of core designer which is kind of a front end based in the cloud on how we can show you the configurability of our cores so we currently have four micro architectures that range from you know a two-stage simple embedded pipeline design all the way up to a 12 plus triple issue out of order super scalar design and you can really adjust the parameters of the cores in a very very uh unique way so like if you wanted a a core that had no floating point capabilities we can do that for you you can do that yourself using the core designer program so you can really try it out you know you can get the subscription to core designer config record download it try it on fpga and try to model your workload and see what are the things that you need in the core before you've even committed to a project so it really helps accelerate the front end development time it reduces front-end development costs great for startups and mature companies and it really lets you understand how to fine-tune for your workload so a lot of configurability is sci-fi's weapon in you know how do we you know how do you stand out when you're using an open iso that anybody could use well this is how right with standard core offerings that are immensely configurable and then we can go to the next level of a custom engagement to really define a platform together with a partner yeah i you know in thinking through like use cases and scenarios and just how how everything moves i mean a lot of the people in the audience may not realize how long historically custom silicon development takes i mean from the time that you're you know designing things and you know doing like the circuit architecture with very expensive very proprietary software and then running simulations that are running at you know a tenth or a 20th or a hundredth of of real time speed just to do the validation and then even like doing all of that even before you you know design masks for a wafer that could be a couple of years of work but with what you guys offer it's all of the tooling and everything necessary to just like you say copy and paste and that means that innovation can move a lot quicker i think for sure we actually did a great partnership with tsmc and a couple of other of the design companies uh microsoft so it was um a fully cloud-based design instance using tsmc's oip framework and we were able to go from a concept of a chip to booting linux on hardware in 183 days that's the blink of an eye right six months right to get to hey it works and it booted linux so now you can work into refinement so thinking of time to market thinking of being able to you know do those kind of things you know why would you want to do that if you look at the growing markets and how fast they appear today new markets emerge in six to 12 to 18 months and get an established player so if you want to be that fast mover that prime mover and really take advantage of that you've got to have that agility and that's one of the advantages that sci-fi offers and it's powered by the extensibility of risk five one of the one of the advantages one of the questions that i had and one of the advantages that i suspect risk five has but you can probably elaborate on a lot more is that you know when we talk about the the tooling and you know it's a lot of these concepts are very very abstract con concepts and one of the instances that i thought of is very concrete something that i i sort of experienced recently with an embedded system that has an older uh mips based design is security and because you have the same code the same sort of base um your security your tooling around your compiler and the tools that you give developers for actually developing on software long after the device has been built is gonna have a lot more longevity because uh what i ran into on this the mips based project was address space layout randomization had been broken for years apparently it took forever to be implemented and then it was actually broken in the compiler and no one noticed and so you know in an era of you know spectre and meltdown and and all this other stuff the tools for working on those things aren't really there it's like it's like having a truck that's neither you know standard or metric or you know imperial or metric it's like some and it's like okay you're getting a socket wrench from uh you know venus and it's like well i don't that's gonna make it really hard to work on this it's gonna make it really hard to get parts and with risk five basically being everywhere or at least the vision for risk five basically being everywhere and standardized it seems like a very concrete crystallized piece of awesomeness is that all of the work that everybody is doing in terms of security research the entire community will benefit from all of that work yeah for sure we're very strong contributor to open source we can you know make tools available we introduce new patches for the linux kernel and for popular compilers recently sci-fi worked with the barcelona super computing center group to build a new api for llvm and gcc so that you can use the upcoming risc-v vector extension with those compilers so you know that's that's work we could have done in isolation kept to ourselves but it's better for everyone if that's available for everyone to use so we can help advance huge projects like the european processor initiative where they're using risc-v vector-based technology for acceleration of ai and it helps for all of our customers too and all points in between so that's that's the benefit of working with an independent neutral standards body like the risk 5 international organization callister the ceo has done a great job of expanding the membership i think we've seen like 100 new companies and partners come on in the last 12 months or so just you know now it's over 400 industry companies and partners from you know research universities through the it's like a who's who of technology so yeah yeah tons of interest tons of development and this is the way that you get your voice heard into the technology of tomorrow right it really levels the playing field from you know the guys that have super deep pockets and can go off and do their own proprietary things um influencing what everybody does because now there's an organization where every specification is ratified and that's that's true for security as well sci-fi shield which is an open specification for platform security is going to be part of the risk fight international standards as well we're going to contribute that we've already published some initial papers and that'll help everybody build truly secure chips using risk 5 that have scalable and really good multi-domain security so you can have a really nice secure chip and understand where your uh vulnerabilities are because you're able to audit everything because it's all open yeah i mean there are so many uh for people in the audience that don't know in the hardware that's out there today right now it's still in use it's not even obsolete hardware and we're not even talking about like the wildly insecure like internet of things toasters and light bulbs and stuff just like actual real sort of non-computer computers stuff that's plugged into the network there are a lot of dangerous insecurities that have crept in because those ecosystems there hasn't really been a commercial impetus on the companies to maintain uh to maintain security level i mean i talked you know a little bit about mips but you know it's one of those situations where you can license it and the company theoretically that has the product could improve the ecosystem but there's no commercial incentive for them to do so uh the intel 8051 microcontroller is another one that i have a lot of experience with in terms of like it being kind of a dumpster fire in terms of security there was a huge kerfuffle just a couple of years ago because uh there is a company that makes usb controllers that are based on the intel 8051 and it turns out they're reprogrammable so you can have a virus in usb at the hardware level that is infectious from device to device because you're able to reprogram the 8051 microcontroller that exists inside of usb devices uh and that was that was sort of like a oops we didn't even think about that and again it's it's it's all because you know it's turtles all the way down but it's because the 8051 which is you know an industrial controller it's like the 80s like they keep calling and we're even thinking about this stuff in the 80s and and so hearing that a lot of this stuff has been anticipated that there are academic papers and it's all in the open this is where we this is absolutely where we have to be for ubiquitous computing because uh those devices just weren't even designed with that in mind and it's coming back to bite us now i mean they're devices that have to be retired before they're really obsolete because they weren't designed with security in mind or they weren't designed with really forward compatibility in mind because even if you wanted to go back to the 8051 and harden it in terms of security there's not software tools that a developer can use to really do that yeah that's a very good point um building an open ecosystem building open partnerships is really going to help us get to as you say ubiquitous computing um that is the key um to security is just being able to audit and understand and refine it and improve it over time it's never going to be done there's always going to be something new to do so it just you got to start somewhere then start from a place of openness and collaboration that's a great way to go forward i think yeah i think um just being able to capture all of the work that somebody is going to do some work on that and if the community or sci-fi itself can benefit from some of the work that its customers need to do for this that and the other then that's going to carry things forward a lot better a lot more quickly than you know the what the alternative has been for the last few years which is like well one major integrator might do a lot of work but then that integrator is not really going to share anything because again there's no commercial reason to so it's it is really exciting to see all the possibilities for where um where risk five can show up i mean i think i think the last time we talked about it it was yeah we were talking about was it a western digital like embedded external hard drives like it shows up there but it's you know it's it's a great solution to that problem yeah there's a lot of a lot of spots for it so you know today sci-fi has really had a lot of success in embedded space because we offer area and power advantages as well as great performance plus we've got the tools to help make the the migration easy so we're seeing a lot of companies adopting that for really even just traditional uses but also more advanced where you know an embedded core is now being almost an application core but you need real-time determinism he needs security hardening you need fixed function you need to reduce surface area all of that stuff is is great for a risk five use you know western dealer run a great job with their own risk 5 development we've partnered with a lot of different companies we have a number of design wins over 175 now with 80 different companies including six of the top 10 semiconductor companies and they're all working on new designs based on risk five with sci-fi inside so we've got a ton of momentum and you know all of the recent events have really just put a focus and a spotlight on sci-fi as hey what else can we do where's our inflection point right here to maybe re-enter a market that we missed or didn't succeed in into a new growth market uh how do we differentiate right because if everyone's using the same core technology and the same software what does the end product look like is it just a race to the bottom in price or is there some other way that we can differentiate on experience and build a better product so that's really the opportunity for us right now yeah i definitely see that there's a lot of opportunity pretty much everywhere in the embedded space from from toasters to security cameras to you know the global stage and the trade wars and we won't get into that but there's just so much opportunity for people to be able to control their intellectual property and and have really good tools for like you say the auditing and everything else um but that also brings me to like one of the first questions which is when can i get a risk five developer workstation uh this year so yeah nice easy one to start off with we're going to sci-fi is announcing our new um hardware that's going to be part of the linley conference at the end of october i think it's the 29th we'll have our cto who's also one of the co-founders one of the co-inventors of risk five young supply give a talk on our new fu 740 chip which is a multi-core application capable risk 5 processor it's got some great features it's coming in a pc form factor so make it really easy for professional developers to get their hands on it and put it into a system and understand like here's what we can do so the intent here is not to go after pc market share we're not trying to build a laptop or a pc for watching videos or do an email what we're trying to do is enable linux developers to build new kernels new drivers new everything that they want to build or real time os that they can use in you know their company's strategic use of risk five so this is how we do the broad enablement of the world of adopting the risk five isa with an application core it's equipped with a linux distro and a real-time os so out of the box you'll be able to just plug it in into your pc build go ahead and start it up and go straight to a familiar environment and from there you the world is yours to command right you can build whatever you need for your company or your personal use we're really focusing on the professional developer for our partners and that's uh the main focus here is just to really kick start the ecosystem kind of like how microchip have done with their polarfire soc icicle kit that's a great board for building uh prototype applications because you've got risk five cores inside of the their soc along with a nice healthy sized fpga and that's got uh sci-fi of course inside there too and you can get started on prototyping your application and getting ready with your product development so a great partner for that so it's like is one of the possible workflows that you could you could you know you've got the developer workstation and you go online and you you put together the ip and then you you program the fpga on the developer workstation and then you're actually trying basically a prototype of what the production hardware would be in you know 180 to 360 days later yeah that's certainly very possible you could you could develop your own ip that fits on that fpga and you can program it on the risk 5 bare metal environment and run it natively accelerate it using the fpga and then you know kind of how everything's going to work before you even got to you know trying to tape out a chip so it's really going to help you understand where do you need workload acceleration so if you're thinking about how do i uh analyze my workload a lot of the time it's really down to watching performance counters and understanding uh where you know how the code changes over time that's really not possible until you're getting some really good hardware um processing going on like on an fpga so that's that's the benefit of having this kind of environment put together is you're going to get to that very very quickly yeah i was just thinking about real-time operating system applications even things like uh you know vision processing or ai applications or anything like that i mean it's just insane to think about that you know an entrepreneur could uh prototype something and have it basically ready to go in a year or less than a year and have access to all of it you know all of this ip in a marketplace that they could build their product on but also their own special sauce i mean that is that is you know 10 years ago that kind of development would take 10 years unless you had unless you had tens of millions of dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars yeah for sure and that's that's one of the benefits of sci-fi's ip partnership model we have this thing called design share where we have some ip already integrated ready to go so that you can understand upfront the licensing costs how to use it how to interfaces with our technology so there's some great ip in there you know from siever for dsp isp other audio processing digital vision processing etc as well as imagination for some of their gpu and then npu technology but it doesn't stop there there's a ton of other different uh partners that we have so you can really explore building your own chip in a single environment so that it's really smooth right it takes out a lot of the oh hey now today i need to be an ip licensing legal expert to progress my project right we can help move all that out so that's a big advantage for startups is there is there a commercial opportunity for let's say that you were a small developer you know one or two or three person shop and you had the developer workstation with the fpga and you were developing new intellectual property that could run on the fpga and you come up with you know a new kind of noise suppression or a new kind of whatever is there an opportunity for those small developers to be able to offer up that intellectual property in the marketplace i'm sure we can figure something out depending on the you know the applicability of the market focus i'm sure that would work um you know it's just a matter of you know proving it out there's you know and everybody loves to buy silicone proven ip which is what we offer so once you get to that stage you know you find a partner to do a test chip then that really is the accelerator but yeah there's no reason why that couldn't be a conversation they have it's a it's it's you know it's like the app store but uh empowering the the app store for smaller development outfits that are able to license their ip to larger companies i mean it's always nice you know i mean you've got the larger companies that have a lot of intellectual property and they'll happily license that out but it's always nice when there's a the market can go the other way you know some small agile smart developers are able to come up with some really killer ip and then have larger companies license that from them yeah that's definitely on on the horizon there's something that's going to happen what's a project that's in development that you can talk about that you're really excited for let's see you can talk about yeah that's the sticking point there that i can talk about so i mean broad strokes we've got some some great partners i think there's a ton of opportunity now we talked about embedded and how we're seeing great adoption there and i think that's going to evolve into things like computational storage smartnics other data processing units because those are going to there's going to be more of a need for offload and intelligence in those devices and that's you know the part of the conversation about ai moving from the data center and an accelerator into the edge and the end point so those those are the kind of opportunities that i get kind of psyched about because there's the things that are gonna you know reduce latency and improve experience for people everywhere because it could be something that's consumer based it could be something that's uh you know never seen by a human but it just makes stuff work better around you you know like a smart factory or better traffic light management i don't know there's a ton of opportunities so there's there's a lot of things in the ai inference processing space and smart infrastructure space that are very exciting that we're exploring right now for sure i said um i think in one of my recent videos i said that uh because our next questions are about the nvidia acquisition of arm and uh i think we got a couple of questions about that and i think one of the things that prompted some of those questions in one of my videos i said that the way i saw it it seemed like risk five was coming for arm at least the low end they were coming for arms lunch and i i definitely believe that but again based on you know a a a computer janitor's limited understanding of the the larger thing it but as a you know as a developer working on stuff the tools for some things are terrible and so it's like you're asking me to use rocks and sticks over here but you know over here it's pretty good generally the arm systems that i've worked on are pretty good but they're really expensive and the risk 5 system that i've worked on has actually been pretty good you know we got the question about the workstation i'm running debian on the embedded system over here and it's a passable experience i've got an older amd gpu in it and it's basically okay it basically works um and that's the one with the fpga in the single pcie slot and uh it's not a terrible experience it's actually pretty good and that's like you know early generation hardware i guess and so because that ex that developer experience was so good it's like why would i ever use anything else especially when we're buying this in silicon it's going to be so inexpensive i mean this like we can buy somebody else's you know mass market mass-produced risk five thing and then my software is just gonna drop right in because linux and everything else runs well whereas linux for mips is just not in a good spot at this point and uh at least in my opinion and so uh you know arm it's like they're not if they're they're not gonna make a bunch of money from the low end but they're in phones and everything else it's like that's opportunity for risk five because you're gonna have the marketplace you're gonna have the short development cycle you're going to have all the stuff those embedded systems really want but also forward compatibility with software as those companies go forward they're going to be able to support their five and 10 year old products without having to employ an army of 50 developers that are figuring out ever increasingly clever hacks to try to keep that obsolete hardware going yeah yeah that's uh that's an interesting discussion so um for us it comes down to we don't see it as either or we see it as and so number one we think that all the technology companies sending conduct companies uh want a competitive market they want choice they want options they want differentiation i think that's pretty easy to say yeah that's true so number two is do you take the view that the markets today are the only markets that exist and that's where we can say no there's new markets coming right automotive and assisted driving and in inciting our internal entertainment systems are a massive growth thing there's a massive growth opportunity in ai at the edge and in the data center in infrastructure like 5g the way that it's causing an entire rip and replace of every bit of existing infrastructure because you need new baseband new stations new handsets new new everything right and they're all pushing towards open ram as well right then there's a whole ton of opportunity of growing markets that are out there and it comes down to do you believe that a win for sci-fi is stealing a socket or should every socket be one on the merits of the technology and we take the position that it's it's open right every every socket is yet to be won every socket is yet to be awarded and we should have a fair shot at it on the basis of the merits of our technology now that's coming you know that conversation has come to the front because of the recent industry acquisition you know the planned acquisition of nvidia for arm i think they're going to continue to be successful but i think that the growth of the opportunities the markets that's out there is going to mean that there is room for everybody to be successful in different ways and our success is fantastic won't be at the expense of anybody else so we can we can succeed without having to steal someone's lunch right there's going to be a buffet and we can get as much shrimp as we want because there's plenty for everyone so while you guys might not be stealing anybody's lunch i don't think mips is going to get any more market share on those new sockets and that's not really because you know everyone's holding their them away from the table it's because they don't want to have any merits to come to the table with right they're out that's that's the conversation right yeah i think that that's for me personally that's what it comes back to is like the tools because i just want to solve a problem as somebody that wants to build something i just want to solve the problem and i care a little bit about the minutia of how the problem is solved it's like i've used an 8051 in my design this is amazing it's like oh by the way we can mine bitcoin with that what yeah we're mining bitcoin at a really slow rate for some guy in russia what and so i don't want to have to think about those things as a developer and so it's like it translates to the quality of the tools i want to have the best tools that i possibly can to solve the problem and some of that's going to be down to reputation it's like nobody ever got fired for buying ibm um but in the semiconductor industry i sort of see this this sort of shrinking things so it's like well you know i could definitely i could definitely see what you're saying about the buffet i also see that there's gonna be perhaps more diversification than there has been um you know historically uh in in in that space because like intel for example i think intel's been trying really hard in the mobile space i've got i get this mobile phone which has got mobile x86 but it's like did you know x86 in a phone can make sense because of the homogeny and all the reasons that you described for like you know everything is there and it's all the same you know you write it here and it works over there but at the same time it's like i don't need to run excel for dos on my phone necessarily so there's got to be there's some cruft here that i've brought along just just for the ride and it makes it hard to abandon those things so that's one of the reasons why i think arm in general has took over the mobile space and it's it's not going anywhere anytime soon in in the mobile space but you know you're right about edge compute and computing getting even more ubiquitous and if it's i think i think it's probably true that if the um if the friction from deploying that everywhere is a lot easier then yes you will absolutely get more computers everywhere because it was super frictionless to deploy more computers and have more computers work with the pre-existing computers in order to solve whatever problem it is or like whatever it is go go away and and i as a developer is like okay we're going to wrap your old 8051 system with this risc-5 system we're not going to try to re-engineer or replace the other 51 system that's just to sunk cost we don't care about it we're going to we're going to surround it with this nice risk 5 based firewall and you can just write us a check and we'll make the problem go away it's like here's your check sounds good let's do it yeah there's a there's a lot of that kind of thinking of the fastest easiest path to protection and like you said it's based on developer enablement and that's why you know this we take that seriously at sci-fi you probably saw earlier this year chris lattner joined sci-fi he's the president of uh product and platform engineering you know did some great work uh at apple on swift at google on tpu at tesla also you know llvm is you know his his creation so very nice set of experience on building scalable high quality enterprise grade software and tool chains and tool sets that people can really use and that's you know really going to start to show up in our offerings as we continue to grow and evolve so that's a lot of reason why we had that great uh recent fundraising round 60 million dollars led by sk hynix but also soda hill qualcomm ventures intel capital et cetera because we've we've got the right people in place and we've got a great idea and we don't need someone to fail for us to win right it's it's a much stronger proposition i don't need to go around saying something's dead or old or whatever else i can say here is the green pasture here's the path come on over the water's fine so that's that's a much nicer way right it stands by itself i could be the bad guy it's fine no no no you're exactly right you're you're you're you're exactly right that is that is a much more diplomatic approach because even even companies that have an interest you know i'm sort of beating up on the intel 8051 but at the same time it doesn't make financial sense for intel to continue supporting the 8051 because it's kind of a black hole of insanity at this point it's like you got it's more baggage than new product that's going to consume you know uh those sockets that you're talking about it's it's there is a need to solve a problem and while it's not quite a square peg in a round hole it's not as good of a fit as potentially sci-fi is and so i i can definitely appreciate your diplomatic approach to to saying it that way um and i definitely agree i mean it's it's it's a better fit and and uh you know everything everything here looks looks pretty good for that so that's a pretty good answer uh we had uh we had some other uh uh we had some other questions that were kind of kind of along that same line which is a a couple of questions that are relating to like gpu acceleration or video acceleration and you know risk five in things like android-based devices maybe a phone maybe a tablet chromebook something like that do you see you know what what sorts of things are going on with risk five in terms of video acceleration or has that been a thing from customers or anything that you can talk about yeah so there's not something sci-fi has looked at i know that uh think silicon i believe have worked on a gpu based on the 64-bit risk 5 instruction set and i saw that at the risk 5 summit last year in december running real real gpu workloads i think john petty did a nice write-up on that so be good to check that out there's there's definitely the conversation about it wherever we come across a a general purpose acceleration kind of uh discussion like an application processor call then it quickly turns into a how do we differentiate integrate and uh really improve the experience for the user right because they've got a great solution already what they need now is a greater solution so we're seeing some you know some conversation there i think that uh you know patrick little on eo coming on board his heritage he helped grow qualcomm's mobile and automotive businesses he's having those conversations right now on the back of the nvidia arm acquisition and the speculation of the problems that's going to cause so you know we've already already got an embedded core in a snapdragon ship it in the 865 right now so there's proof of concepts happening everywhere what that turns into you know as a handset or uh something else you know that's the the stuff that's tbd and that's where you've got to have a long-term vision a partnership and a lot of investment so that's really where we're we're hoping to grow we want to move into the application process of core space even more deeply than we are now but in a way that is not trying to just say hey we're going to replace your general purpose application processor because yep that's not worked right that's they're done scaling now you need accelerators from image processors and video decode and other kinds of manipulation to something else so that's why we've been talking a lot about the vector extension having a core an application core that is vector math capable with very high flexibility ability to scale from you know 4096 bit to 128 bit in the software without having to know the hardware underneath is a much better approach than what you've seen elsewhere and that's going to drive a ton of adoption in those use cases where you need a lot of parallel intensive workloads and stuff right it's all the advantages of being more flexible than cmd and still being extensible and flexible and more efficient than a general purpose cpu so pulling that tightly integrated into the core isis so you've got that converged core is a huge strong impact right because it means some people looking at like oh well maybe we can do you know something maybe we don't need so many special purpose things you know and we can drop some of the license that we're doing or maybe it means that that function is doing actually gets really really good and we're class leading in that experience now so that's the the conversations that are going on i wish i could give more details but that's where we're at right now well listen that's that's enough to to what developers interest i'm sure i mean they will really perk up at uh not having to think about it and it's just sort of handled in software because i'm sure they're sitting there thinking it's like look i already feel the call of the void enough if you can make it to where i don't have to think about whether or not this is 128-bit or 4096-bit or whatever uh that's going to make my life easier and that at the end of the day making people's lives easier amazon amazon aws is built on making people's lives easier and it's not it's not the cheapest option but it does make people's lives easier in terms of all of the stuff you know that that's going on there and all all the stuff that they offer um we had a couple of questions about you know what about picking up a an inexpensive developer kit like i think you guys have a raspberry pi like thing like where do you pick that up what is that like how does that work yeah so previously we've had two boards available for purchase we've had the high five one rev b which you can get through i believe mauser right now or crowd supply you can grab those their in-stock and ship in um 50 or 60 bucks i think it is it's an embedded processor got some nice basic input output things you can really do a lot of work with that one to understand what is a risk five processor and build some cool iot devices etc uh we've had the high five unleashed board which i think you've been playing with it's got the fph expansion all that kind of stuff it's a lot of fun a lot of fun and uh that one's going to be replaced by our new board that's coming out at the lindy conference so that a transition will be making new ones going to be faster better easier to play with all that kind of good stuff yes this is it's a crazy amount of fun i've got i've got thunderbolt in there oh did you get thunderboat on risk 5 working working in quotation marks things like i think things like dma are a bit of a challenge yeah but there's an fpga there so i mean you know you can there's a lot you can do on the fpga to just kind of like ham-fisted together but um yeah i don't know so it's a it is a lot it is a crazy amount of fun and it's really that's what makes it exciting is like having the hardware to play with and uh seeing the performance and seeing how much is there how quickly and like what the vision is in the marketplace and like what it's going to open up for entrepreneurs i mean it really it really will be game changing because you know i'm i'm personally of the opinion that sometimes larger companies you know they sort of get bogged down and they maybe don't innovate as quickly and a lot of the time it's easier to innovate through acquisition than it is to innovate through you know your own internal people sort of lose sight of what what kind of problem they're solving but with this it's you know it gives you full access to pretty much everything from top to bottom so it is really genuinely very exciting yeah for sure that's uh that's really the intent behind the boards is to help people uh you know get to know it capture it risk five is being taught at universities across the world you know the patterson hennessy uh architecture book is based on risk five now so we're we're expecting to see a lot more uh risk fire based development coming out very very soon well we're we're uh we were about 45 minutes in so i we should probably start to wrap it up but is there anything that i haven't asked that you were hoping that i would ask or anything that you want to share or say or you know this is this is this is your time because sci five is i wanted to do this about every year at the or every six months at the rates you guys are moving what was it every 180 days about every 180 days yeah i know it's a it's a great time to be part of the technology industry there's been you know a lot of predictions that have gone uh different ways than what people thought so i remember people saying you know pcs were dead the market's shrinking and boom it's back because everybody needs a pc and then there was all the you know hey no one can take over the data center the software load migration is too hard and hey there it goes it's starting to move to different architectures so i think that fundamentally you know if if your answer to you know why isn't this going to be successful is because we've never done that before that's that's the gut check you need to make right give it a chance because there's going to be a good way to do it with risk five sci five might be the right guys to work with on this we're super focused on the workload specific acceleration on finding customers who are going to be partners for building new platforms uh we're not interested in the the general purpose compute market today it's you know we don't want to build sci-fi branded laptops chips notebooks pcs whatever it is that's not the game the game is to make high-performance architectures that are going to be part of some really cool experiences along down the line and that's the focus so i'd say that's my number one thing of what i want people to take away from today is it's just going to continue to grow from here risk 5 is real we're seeing more and more adoption um i could give you the list of you know all the places that we're shipping today from you know the synaptics uh usb type-c video controllers we're inside of those through to coherent logics for male aero and some really focused uh tla customers that are doing wonderful things network processes with inovium there's just this groundswell of adoption and you know sci-fi is leading the way so keep an eye on us give us your support we're we're hiring we're looking for talented programmers and engineers check out whether you want to be part of the risk 5 uprising get in on the ground floor yeah you know uh i didn't think about networking and and uh 5g until you mentioned it but we are at a point where like inside of general purpose systems you know if you if you want to do you know use a desktop processor let's say to switch you know a gigabit's worth of traffic okay that's not unreasonable i mean a gigabit that's a that's a billion bits but you know that's not unreasonable for a modern microprocessor to handle but okay we're going to switch you know 10 10 gigabit ports which is not unreasonable for what you might find in a cell tower with all those frequencies and antennas and they're very very like a five degree bent that ain't happening with general purpose that's going to take custom silicon and the faster you guys can drive the price down uh the faster we will see sort of state subsidized equipment for that go away and also other you know everybody can be secure in that hey this is the open isa this is how it's built there's nothing weird going on with the heart nobody's playing any any shenanigans with the hardware um and you have that kind of a switching capacity in silicon managed by risk five cores i've got a i've got a a an aristo switch which is a broadcom chipset with an x86 in front of it and you can program the broadcom to do certain kinds of packet filtering and stuff like that in silicon but it's you know big giant pieces of custom silicone that cost a crazy amount of money like 10 or 15 years ago and it's basically just obsolete at this point because it can't like all the fancy new stuff that you need to do like our dma is a little buggy and it doesn't work and it's got problems but having something like risk five at the heart of that with more modern ip and that shorter product development cycle means that products like that are only going to be way less expensive and so just like the whole networking branch for the opportunities for risk five is is is uh really tremendous i think yeah definitely a ton of advantage there and shorter development cycles does reduce the the cost for a company to build in your product and iterate on it and improve it so you can see an advantage there you can also see a better experience so the value is higher and i think that's where most companies are going to be focusing like how can i not just i don't want to race to the bottom anymore i want to race to the best value that's where people are seeing the biggest impact on not only uh the you know the benefit for the world but the experience in the hands of the user or end technician whatever it is but the the people who you know pay for it all are appreciative of it because better value results in a more sustainable long-term company that's around to continue to develop products and support them as well well those are those are all of that is are our very laudable goals for sci-fi as a company because uh we definitely need that we definitely need uh these kinds of uh you know sort of public standards or public fittings i guess you know i don't know it's like community plumbing is one way that i could go with the analogy but but also you know just standards for how everything fits together because nobody wants like okay you got to start from the beginning because of intellectual property laws it's like you get bogged down at the rocks and sticks level so it's it's really exciting to not have to worry about that and just focus on innovating but know that the foundation that you're building on is you know solid absolutely it just imbues a sense of trust and uh permissiveness right you feel like you can do what you need to do so you're ready to get started so it spurs innovation and just that let's give it a shot because i think it'll work so that's that's a great place to be awesome well this has been an awesome chat everything all things uh sci-fi i'm sure you'll be lurking in the in the comments and uh you know so if you have if you gotta if you didn't get a question in you know you still got a little bit of an opportunity or if you're looking for a job just definitely check that out i'll try to have a link to that in the in the bottom of the description so thank you mr caveman jim mr james pryor uh and uh i look forward to the next time we do this which shouldn't be too awfully long that would be great thank you so much when it was great talking to you
