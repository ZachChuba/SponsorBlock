the battle between the best possible start ever while some have fought to claim the throne there is a legend who continues to prove himself ahead of the pack and he continues to bury his legacy deeper into the soil of god's country time and time again and today he takes the lead once again proving himself worthy of the throne now hold on a minute i know what you're thinking frost you've uploaded so many fast to start ever so many best start evers but listen this best star ever is the best of those best starts ever so it's only reasonable for me to title it this now pay attention because you're not going to want to miss the following events as they have what oh [ __ ] yeah i forgot wait one now where the hell were we my best start ever in rust it's a pretty big title and i've used it before but today was a pretty big day holy [ __ ] there's a fat compound here in the y20 those base actually is active they have a scrap pellet on their roof they have lights on multiple [ __ ] compounds so we found this big ass base right off the bat but a quick assessment of its defense showed us that we weren't going to be able to do anything too crazy to them because they just had too many turrets but they did provide me with some entertainment throughout the night [Music] i got a bow garage door oh wow not a waste of my [ __ ] time oh [ __ ] oh there's a base oh it's going to what should i do try to yoga them down the back kazi like west kind of behind the furnace oh he's building something right here should i roll up and try to yoke or should we just [ __ ] crack him with bone arrows oh oh oh i don't know all right he just went inside he might go build something out there he might just be going to get resources anything should try to outcome sit where he was building oh yeah he is there's a dude we could wait for him to place tc oh [ __ ] oh we have tc right here it's he places it already he's gonna come get it right he's gonna come get it i'm gonna you'll come nice [Music] enough to set up a base you want to get the [ __ ] out yeah okay no he liked it hit it with that double double didn't know what the [ __ ] happened he's like what the [ __ ] i'm adding a little bing bong [Music] above [Music] i'm done once twice three times [Music] dead nice good [ __ ] i think i see our base archie [Music] damn low-key missed our opportunity with this space right here that would have watched me could have put tc right there could have built a triangle front oh [Music] oh [ __ ] man watch out he's right there on the roof he's just chilling up there dude nice but he's having fun [Music] great at power is there let's go [Music] well this isn't obvious they'll never see it coming right here is the guy talk right as well somewhere [ __ ] me he just [ __ ] on me did he cuz he didn't hit me at all there's two of them i had you hit one [Music] there's [ __ ] full kids here dude dude how did i just not kill like i shot an akkit five times oh they're fighting so [Music] jump down into the thing i'm in the ditch right come come here [Music] that was the guy eluded i think or was he with somebody holy [ __ ] this guy grab his ak where's our base uh uh it's not listening okay oh yeah you're right we did baseball outposts whoa what the [ __ ] damn dude if i didn't have the [ __ ] we would still go counter there right now is that our face wait wait no no no one knows like directly towards it though yeah holy [ __ ] they're going in dude i still want to go to there we go right when we get home here's our base holy [ __ ] oh the shot incensed kill the raiders again it's on the road the guy on top of that plate he's got a rocket launcher on his back he's gonna rock it in a minute here i could spray him when you want tell me when you're ready he has night vision he has night vision on so we need to do this like tell me when you're ready i'm ready to drop that all right ready and go throw them three times nice you should be done headshot him nice they're definitely dead [Music] dead kill him kill him nice loaded we're getting silent silence from your challenge [Music] i'm in here oh my god archie what the [ __ ] i'm stacked right now like i'm loaded i got eight so eight c4 what oh my [ __ ] god i've got like 1.5 kgp 3k frag good [ __ ] no there's so much [ __ ] how do we even deepen others see okay we go we want to go in i don't know go up just go up don't go don't go our base was so close to the raid and it was so small that we didn't want to go inside yet as they might raid it instantly and we wouldn't be able to defend [Music] [ __ ] we need boxes bro making i'm making two boxes [Music] i'm jumping kill one outside [Music] one's to the inside i'm pretty sure i'm gonna jump from this side i'm gonna go from the side [Music] what the [ __ ] there was another one bro there's still dude only that empty guy was like shooting from a window or something that we could get up to because i have five ladders and it's like bro what if somehow we set up something to where we kill him on the roof pin him like keep him dead get him in a position like where we kill him and can hold it and you can hold his body with like just ak spraying him you know yeah and like we just two c4 stone wall i have five ladders we ladder up the side of his base boom [ __ ] m2 we could have a load maybe it was a shitty idea but you know what's content if you don't try the unthinkable first we had to move all of our [ __ ] though to a different base because the guys that we counted would probably roam rate us if they found out where we lived and we had the perfect base in mind [Music] after that we went and scouted out the base and then we realized that it was a damn good thing that we moved [Music] wait wait are they reading our old base that's like right toward our base [Music] yeah they're definitely already in the first door what the [ __ ] that guy just deviated a kid they're here i'm gonna shoot him oh please nice [Music] now this dude once is he alive holy [ __ ] he melted me down the back okay so you killed this guy in here [Music] well we didn't have anything to lose at that base but we could always take a few extra kits considering what we were about to do was extremely stupid [Music] two of them this time but still sitting on the roof with m2s and rocket launchers and they are egging people on a chat to come raid them d-e-n in shadows a random name freeman was telling them they had 10 minutes to despawn their loot and they responded with haha funny good luck though we will despawn your loot when you're dead and after about 10 minutes of us sitting there contemplating what we were about to do we finally gained up the courage to do it all right i'm gonna go cover me i'll try oh my god they were [ __ ] already he doesn't run to that corner the whole entire time except when i start to cross just hold i'm gonna keep baiting these guys [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so dead they just killed you what the [ __ ] okay come back one day i got nice i'm just gonna go right now oh he's dead what the [ __ ] i just killed another is there can you are you back here buddy yeah all right i'm gonna go i can see the body right here it's like glitching through i don't think they can literally either watch out he's gonna peek me he's right above me i'm gonna i can't let this [ __ ] okay um i don't know what to do dude i cannot loot this petrol did you kill him no no hit him again i think he's dead yeah he's daisy dead i killed the other one nice i'm coming you're both dead by the way gg man the [ __ ] says gg we're going offline anyway okay buddy at least you could revive me don't worry about it gg dude i'm not gonna pick you up dude and we killed it's frost man you could be in our next video [Music] yeah it is you want to be in my next video dude yes [Music] what the hell it's frost yeah look at this boys what the [ __ ] i'm gonna throw down everything just go put in a sash and then come back dude it's right here no it's totally [ __ ] now it's gone oh might have turned it is that it i found it m2 two [ __ ] f boy let's go two m twos and two rocket launchers for the price of a few five five six bullets we didn't even have to use the c4 i think i'll take it no good close only half a gear set what the [ __ ] are they saying are they trying to make excuses for why they died [Music] wait what the f what is going on what the [ __ ] are they raiding right by our base yes surprisingly yes they were i think it's that base [Music] i'm pushing up [Music] dead thank you [Music] dude it's all open dude these are what the one rocket one rocket launcher 98 expo ammo another rocket launcher and another ak dude what the [ __ ] is it wait tier three why is there two three in a box and you put a door on move [Music] well i'm stacked right now like i'm loaded yeah we need to [ __ ] go let's just go let's just grab all the good [ __ ] in this game [Music] holy [ __ ] at this point we didn't even know what was going on things were moving so fast we had so much loot and now we had two m2s in a row of explosives at this point we won but we could still have a little more fun [Music] oh it's nice this is the frost bunker design for helicounter [Music] that worked [Music] three and a half hours three and a half hours is all it took for us to get this insane amount of loot that's fast it's like really fast i mean we had boxes of guns rows of a case a row of explosives so much [ __ ] so we had a little bit of fun with it right off the bat we might have some of our rockets in fun ways what the [ __ ] but then we decided to go raid our neighbor the only reason we didn't rush to raid after is because the server kind of died after we took kelly but i mean we chose somebody who was online at least to give him a chance and then we used all of our explosives [Music] on [Music] yes that was sad but such as rust oh four c4 holy [ __ ] we took the rest of the explosives and we headed up northeast and finally found a group that we could [ __ ] with i mean like seriously like we [ __ ] with this group a little bit too hard i think [Music] nice [Music] tell them right here two full kits ah he just doubled me he's pissed [Music] good [ __ ] [Music] killed him well then should we read them let's write them three you open again naked no [ __ ] hey bro that would have killed him that was everything as well i can see in yeah we could do we have enough for this maybe should we just [ __ ] hit it [ __ ] it you want to hold right there and with the last bit of energy in us archie and i headed over to our secret little hiding spot with all their loot we grabbed the satchels the c4 and the explosive ammo and then we headed out for one final hoo-rah you want to just hit it oh it's already low should i should i throw something else on it two satchels open two satchels and yeah yeah let's just go [ __ ] it i see him i see him [Music] oh it's a one by two how much do we have four four explosive four c4 and then two stacks of expo ammo two gl's it is eight c four to get through uh yeah do we just continue to go through we can go through two more garage doors they might [ __ ] up true there'll only be one guy go inside the play is definitely just to stay in here though yeah yeah for sure i've still got gl so i have two gl's as well and two stacks of expo all right we going through this one yeah that'll be the last one i'm pretty sure i'm dead i'm dead opening opening opening come on now come out i'm dead [Music] and that my friends is the epic story of archie and frost
