all right lads welcome back to my channel if you are new here my name is Tom Harlock and I do not have an intro but I do have a business class ticket to hell and in an effort to keep my seat I've decided it'd be a great idea to take on approximately 4% of the world's population twins in an ideal world you would have gobbled them up for nutrients but alas your roommate survives in hey presto you're a twin what do you do now exist purely to make me feel uncomfortable apparently from the creepy gravy twins in the shining to the creepy Dolan twins in 2019 twins have always been a spectacle and in today's video I'm going to dive into my thoughts feelings conclusions and I'll probably get an outfit in there or two in an effort to find out exactly what is wrong with twins oh I did nothing in films I despise where they referenced the title of the film as dialogue in the film tacky embarrassing but if I'm honest I was just trying to provide a little bit of structure and narrative to this video a lot of my fellow creators could and should be taking copious amounts of notes I'm only joking I haven't actually watched any YouTube videos from any of my fellow youtubers I can just sense it you know I'm very in tune with the earth I ever heightened spirit my third eye is practically gaping I can actually predict world events such as 9/11 presidential election results I can even tell if your boyfriend's cheating on you he is do you not believe me well you shouldn't because nobody can do that stuff psychics don't exist and that leads me into my first point today if you're new to my channel you may not know that I'm a massive fan of a backronym so to find out exactly what is wrong with twins we're gonna have to spell it out teed T is for twice the body half the personality twins from the moment they're born are considered pretty special something that personally I disagree with there's literally two of you and that's my very definition of not being special at all in the same way that it requires basically no talent to be beautiful it requires even less effort to be a twin yet there are loads of famous twins out there who are popular because or what well [ __ ] knows if I'm honest as I was saying I think telepathy psychics and mediums so we'll a bunch of Shipe and for the record I don't think I agree or believe in religion or science either what about it let me introduce to you the psychic twins Linda and Terry James really psychic twins I'm Terry and I'm Linda apparently they've predicted 9/11 attacks the Paris attacks and they've also conversed with the late lady Princess Diana I know what you're thinking I want to speak to Princess Diana from beyond the grave well we're in luck the psychic twins have provided a handy video titled are you psychic and get a message the answer's no I have a dream or a strong sense even a vision that something was gonna happen to yourself or a family member yep I do either sense I'm about to watch a very [ __ ] video this is called precognition and it may be an indication that you are psychic I'm clairvoyant which means you have clear sight so you're telling me I can't be a sidekick because I haven't got clear sight because I have to wear contact lenses smells that ableism to me bet you didn't predict the court case in 2019 digit ladies so if you're good at picking up the thoughts of other people you may have telepathy people love the gimmick of twins so much they're willing to believe these ladies a psychic if here is just the one of them people wouldn't be going oh look at that psychic lady who doesn't know how to dress it wouldn't be a conversation walk into a room and feel when people are there's a weird vibe in the room where there's creepy people that you don't want to associate with I do sometimes walk in the room and get a feeling people are about to be upset with me it's usually directly before I call them unattractive unsuccessful and untalented clairvoyance tend to be very artistic and use the right side of the brain which is the creative side of the brain more than the left side that's family if you're not sure whether you should be using the left hand side or the right hand side of your brain I have a top tip for you use all of it every single lobe you can use all the help you get your [ __ ] idiot did you ever have an imaginary friend when you were a kid well you know it's probably a spirit or any angel that you were seeing or your child of a seen if my child had an imaginary friend I would make my child he imaginary meals until they learned how to grow up and thank God thank God I'm really glad you haven't been burnt at the stake yet ladies but just a heads up the crowd aren't chanting burn the witch the shouting burn the wig please burn your wigs you get my point twins with gimmicks nah absolutely not get a hobby separate yourself from each other you're not Siamese be your own person have one name have a mononym do you want to be Madonna you could be cher if you wanted to but you don't you're happy being a subservient twin moving on we have W and W is for what the [ __ ] you [ __ ] wearing I'm not quite sure how to say this without sounding offensive but here we go if you're over the age of 12 and you're intentionally matching your twin you're a fantastic I'll forget for abortion don't get me wrong it's kind of cute when you're a kid and you can't do as much as wipe your own ass but if you're old enough and big enough to be spending your hard-earned money on clothes and you intentionally match your sibling please wear protection because babies born from incest they usually genetically [ __ ] I search twins on Instagram and saved a few photos so let's play a fun game of would I be seen response ring and back to the day's video and now to introduce the hit game show of the century would I be seen dead wearing that first that we have the Dolan twins in a Coachella outfit playboy and converse and match and obviously because how on earth would we know if they're twins if not wearing matching clothes it's not other don't look like each other enough in knock knock who's there not your individual personalities shining in this photo if I'm completely honest boys another Dolan twin photo with them wearing matching shoes matching socks and probably matching [ __ ] rings it looked like a couple in this one so I'm gonna skip it because I'm scared of their fun B wouldn't be seen dead sorry boys next up we have the Khan twins and these were fine oh my God look at these Gekko look in human beings they look like Zayn Malik if someone tried to make him on the Sims whilst they were having a stroke and then they put that Zayn Malik sim in the pool took out the ladder and threw in the cook at matching glasses matching shirts matching face to nuts well it's really something isn't it boys your mother should have swallowed twice wouldn't be seen dead boys I'm so sorry oh the dobre twins doing that classic twin move where they wear the exact same outfits but the shoes are a different color direct can they help tie to the shoes up when whilst the down there just what is it with youtubers and thinking that my Gucci's gonna make them look nice don't be the one to break actually no I do want to be the one to break it to you you look tacky none of you can dress do you think spending thousands and pounds on overpriced ugly items of clothing as fast fashion is gonna make you look nice it disenrolled yeah twins aren't you annoyed that you're wasting so much money buying the same item of clothing twice in the same exact size because one of you can't be bigger or thinner than the other or muscular and more pretty because then the balance will be off and you can't function without each other if I saw two twins my age wearing the same outfit out yeah I'm probably billion I probably physically assault them if I'm honest I'll catch a case for that because it's just not right it's not on I just don't like it when twins are too close it freaks me out a little bit and that brings me on nicely to aye-aye is for irritating the incestuous probably the French say bonjour and the Australian Saiga taken English people say cor blimey governor and American say their prayers for victims of school shootings despite not doing much about gun control when you grow up in a particular area your speech is affected this means it's pretty common for you to sound like or say similar things to your friends and close relatives people from your hometown that's pretty normal what isn't normal is this let me introduce Bridget and Paula powers apparently the only time these ladies have been separate in literally decades is when one of them had their appendix burst and in two weeks later Veon had their appendix burst it's embarrassing grow up we can't even have independent health issues oh my god when one of the screams Hospital getting our appendix out but Bridget used to come in every hmm visiting hours when I caught funniest thing about these twins is they try and pretend that they can speak in unison because they're twins and it's a gimmick obviously but they're not very good at doing it even though they've spent like every day together for 50 years only when we're a little mom did separate us as when when little toddlers one stayed at Nan's place and one to say our auntie's and we just have non-stop swimming I don't condone child abuse but the second these two girls started doing this non-stop I would have cut out the tongues one of them is pretty dominant and leads their conversation and the other ones just watch now like yeah is it difficult for you to operate normally when you're apart because you don't think properly and and we're not our cells how do we bang this may sound like the grossest thing I've ever said in my life but I'm a youtuber so I'd only be doing it for a social experiment but I can't have sex with one of them to hear if they try and moan in unison ladies if you're out there have you ever had boyfriends but we've got each other's company I really don't mean it's in a horrible way but I hope one of these ladies dies young so the other one gets to experience a bit of a life without her the twins dream of married life together well well our plan is probably just next door when and have the exactly same identical house and even though furniture probably being that Saints no offense but I think it's a bit [ __ ] rude if I ask you a question you individually and your twin starts trying to answer at the same time I'm gonna knock her out moving on we have N and n is for no please seriously where are the jokes on the rare occasions they're not trying to be psychic planned coordinating outfits all give off mildly incestuous vibes like most people who don't have a tangible talent they take to comedy between Instagram and tick-tock and YouTube there are tons of twins trying to climb that social ladder but none quite struck a nerve like Chris and Patrick virus yo my name is Chris hello Patrick and we were the Boros twins this video is called awkward in Vancouver and if I had to watch it and so do you it smells so good if I was that woman yet I would have starts screaming it's boys like these who deserve to be falsely accused of crimes can I have one of your nerds tell you what mate if you want nuts that bad I'll give you one of these walnuts if you promise to never take one of your brothers nuts ever again sit sit you don't have a no-fun you do have a knife thanks for asking this one's gonna be used for your major organs and this one's gonna be used to remove your skin he just keeps going around asking people if there is father sounds like me every time the doorbell went between the ages of 10 and 15 hi mom hi dad what are you guys doing here hey Jenny doctor someone else but you're my dad are these supposed to be realistic as somebody who has spent a lot of time looking for that father I can assure you there's a lot more emotion that goes into it miss if you didn't think that was irritating enough these boys have made a video where they try doing an innuendo bingo type situation they fill their mouths up with water sit opposite each other and he try and tell funny jokes so basically we're gonna miss us to make me laugh what do you call and you come by the kangaroo Alice you a sweater with pockets well at least they can't make this incest it can Nate I stand corrected the premise of this video is to make each other laugh but if I'm honest I'm getting more of a give each other interaction vibe by the looks of things the twins have turned into wrestlers now which is great because it means they get to touch each other in the day and the night I think that's all I have for
