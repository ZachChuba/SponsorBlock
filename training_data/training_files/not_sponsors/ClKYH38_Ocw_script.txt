will lose 10 of these squares let's hop into the episode if you would like to or in the description and it will take you through all of those the first thing I'm gonna go ahead and do is complete the Black Knights fortress quest that's going to give us another chunk to open up [Music] [Music] and here we go this is gonna be cuesta completed and of course another chunk unlocked 2500 GP very nice we'll take that and the three quest points as well which actually gives us 34 quest points doesn't that mean I can get to the champions guild am i being an idiot here I feel like it does that could be another chunk you naughty naughty thing you need thirty-two quest points to get in which means that takes us to that so that's two chunks to unlock we'll head over to the champions guild now so we actually get in there and then we'll open up the chunk for unlocking a guild and the chunk for completing a quest here we go coming into the guild greetings for adventure welcome it's the guild of champions I feel like a [ __ ] champion right now I won't lie if we just before we open up these two chunks let's have a look in here this is opening up so much new stuff for us we talked to Scavo we can now get ourselves a rune sword the the rune sword is better DPS than a longsword there's also the rune plate legs is the rune chain body we've got the green d hide stuff as well oh my god and over here we also have the big black star for the cape and the ADI play buddy probably just gonna skip past all of that to be honest and try and make enough money to buy everything in here because that is his upgrades left right and center we already have the 40 defense we already have a 40 attack so we can use all the rune stuff we need to get 40 range if we want to use the green d hide stuff but honestly really really happy with that let's go and see if things can get even better with a couple of good unlocks right here we go what are we gonna get the first of the two dark wizards tower the agility unlocked which means we can now train agility that's amazing I can jump over the wall for naught point 5 XP and we can get that to level 10 and that will allow us to use the the Draenor agility course so that is now a Dilla T unlocked that's pretty sick I'm very happy with that dark wizards tower as well I'm pretty sure we can kill them for like nature runes and Laurens pretty easily the mine is pretty pointless but we'll take that let's see what we're gonna get for our second unlock as well here we go [Music] that means we can start priests in peril I think that allows us to the whole of priest in peril we'll have to look into that as well but a couple of really good unlocks there actually I'm very very happy I think I'm gonna try and make some money now so we can borrow the rune stuff then we'll probably go ahead and get the agility 210 and then from there we'll have a look at if priests imperil is doable now I've had a little think about it I do have 16 K already and we also did a load of mining at mother lode mine I have 244 gold ore so maybe if we go ahead and get the crafting up a little bit or maybe we've actually already got the crafting let's have a quick look jewelry yeah we could I think it's one of these two the gold bracelet or the gold necklace they sell for quite a good amount at general stores and stuff like that so maybe that's the way to make a bit of money seeing as we we're gonna get levels from it anyway so I think that might be what we do but this is the grind we've got to do like I don't really know exactly how long this is gonna take because there isn't really anyone who's ever done this before but I'm yeah I've got a hog over this wall several hundreds if not thousands of times and as you see every time we do it like that we get one XP so it's not point five every jump and that is how we are gonna get our XP eighty-three XP until the next levels so I'll see you back in a bit think this is gonna be seven agility coming in yes it is that is seven agility took about 10 15 minutes to get half a level I think we were around halfway through six so I think AHA I hope it takes this this takes about an hour but it could be two and this should be level eight coming in that is level a do we get anything new no nothing new back to the grind and this is gonna be level nine coming in one more level and then we can go over to Draenor and get some proper XP at the moment we're averaging 477 XP an hour huge here we go guys just took over an hour to get it done and that is level 10 coming in which means we can now use the draynor village course cross the rope swing on the moss giant as well cool so I'm probably gonna head on over to Draenor now and we'll probably just go for that six seven five total levels so we can open up a chunk so yeah we'll just get the agility levels we need for that so we're getting about 100 XP per lap and our first mark of grace as well which is very nice they are worth 10k each if we were on a main account and we were going to use the amylase crystals but obviously we're gonna go for that graceful set so we're starting to work towards that graceful set we don't actually have the birth or square unlocked where we would be able to cash these in but seeing as we're gonna need like 260 I believe is what we need it's probably gonna be quite a while before we do that anyway that is 18 agility coming in and giving us 675 total levels that is another chunk to unlock let's go ahead and see if we're gonna get anything useful here here we go oh and Chiana yes that means I can now do lost city I think we have everything for lost city that's amazing [ __ ] yes okay let's look into this and this could be the dragon weapon grind and and get lost city done so we got ourselves 228 Jersey which means we can now use the AL courage agility course which we do have unlocked but I want to go ahead and do lost city and velocity we need 31 crafting so what I'm gonna do is turn all of these gold ores into gold bars and then make them all into bracelets that way we'll be able to sell the bracelets for some really really good profit and we'll also get out crafting up so it's sort of two birds with one stone whether 200 and whatever gold all we have is gonna be enough I don't know we will see it probably is gonna be close though that is the last of the gold bars got me 227 nearly 28 crafting we do have a few gems in the bank though so do we have a chisel we don't have a chisel right now so I need to buy chisel but if we have a look I've got five sapphires and an emerald that we can definitely cut I can cut that as well so we might get ourselves close to that twenty-eight but we are gonna have to find ourselves a little bit more crafting XP and we had to have one more bar there which I will do if I was selling one per world which I obviously won't do but let's just say I did that's two hundred and twenty times by two hundred and forty that is 53 K in gold bracelets right there probably with selling multiple per world it's more like forty to forty five K but uh definitely a good chunk of money there to go towards our rune fund I'm taking this opportunity to get a few range levels up so way yeah that's what we're gonna be doing get some range levels and get all the cowhide get ourselves to 31 crafting there we go guys that is 31 crafting coming in which means we can now go ahead and do Lost City we can also craft emerald amulets that is 39 magic coming in I just realized I didn't actually have the crumblin dead unlocked so I just quickly bought a few runes and stuff and went to the warriors the Ice Warriors and killed a few of them we got some cosmetics nature's and deaths as well while doing that but we will now be able to use crumbling dead on the tree spirit sings it is level 101 I wanted the the spell we were meant to have to do it can I take the boat I can there we go cool and we will finish off Lost City pretty easily to be honest and now we can use crumble Undead to absolutely destroy this tree spirit there we go that is the kill and we should be able to get ourselves some Draiman branches I'm gonna get a few because we do need them for other quests we need to make cinnamon of these as well I believe I think that's what you do with it so I'm just gonna get a few here we go boom through the door and bang we have completed the quest three quest points access to sonorous very very nice of course that unlocks a new chunk and of course it means we now have access to all of this we have the dragon longsword and the dragon dagger in the market but getting a diamond door a cut diamond on this account is gonna be very very difficult so I'll have to look into whether or not I'm gonna do that or not and are we gonna get rewarded with a good chunk let's see o caliph is opening up as well another Slayer master unlock so we can definitely start Slayer now and anything else there we've got the bank the agility course oh [ __ ] the agility course I totally forgot about that that's sick that's the way we're gonna get all of our marks of grace from okay I'll take it I'll take it umm nothing really other than that I don't think but uh definitely nice to start unlocking this side of the map because you know I do want to get to barrows doing barrows and this camp would be sick it'd feel really good so I'm gonna go ahead and sell five of these per world and see if we can get enough money together to get ourselves a rune sword I mean we definitely will there's enough here for sure so uh it's gonna sell five and then hop and keep doing that until we have 20 plus K that is 20 K they're still 184 bracelets I'm gonna sell just a couple more just to make sure we've got enough but uh we are gonna go and buy a rune sword there we go boom or 1.7 K still left and that is our best in slot okay so we're going proper nostalgic here and killing flesh crawlers because of the XP it's pretty good XP and they do drop some useful stuff as well a lot of I adore and nature runes and stuff like that and also they can only hit a max of one and just above the the entrance to the stronghold I can fish trout and salmon so just makes a lot of sense right I was thinking that wasn't very good XP I don't know what the wiki was talking about so I decided to check YouTube and I found a guide from seven years ago and it has just taught me a new location which I didn't know as a kid this would be the first time I've ever done it I did not know this the last time I was here was as a as a kid training so we're gonna go down into this bottom south corner and apparently there should be a load of flesh crawlers in this maybe they've changed it since then no they haven't there we go Wow I used to train up on those too thinking that was the best place but no here we go oh my god this is gonna be amazing XP and I can super afk this that is 44 attack coming in which gives us 700 total level which also means we are going to go ahead and open another chunk up here we go let's see where we are going and it is Mel's ours maze which will be used in Dragon Slayer so I guess it's sort of useful also the boat that takes us to our D nothing to use for at the moment I think we need that for a comment what quest is but it's a it's the one we have to give all the vials in and stuff plague City I think it's plague city yeah so yeah not so useful at the moment but in the future it will be a square that will be happy that it is unlocked I've just been f king here at the Cal fights and totally forgot that we are actually unlocked a new chunk by going to 725 total yeah I've been afk we've been getting really bad expiate 10k an hour I've just moved from my laptop to the to the desktop right now that's why the XP stance like 6k but yeah we're getting about 10k now which is absolutely atrocious I did going at myself 45 strength as well just to get that max hit up we got one extra makes it so we can hit nines while on accurate three more levels to go until we can start to use dragon weaponry but once we are level 17 we will then have to get a diamond somehow so we can actually get into the sonorous marketplace so are the grinders and ton when we get this done we also need to get a diamond from somewhere and if it's an uncut diamond then I have to get the crafting level to be able to cut the diamond which I believe is about 50 crafting so what yeah we're gonna get this 60 soon but before we do that let's open up a chunk let's see if we're gonna get any luck here goblin village that's part of like lost city and the deaths of dogecion and all that isn't it that's actually really good we can unlock ham chess for a diamond anyway back to the attack grind for you it was like a 1 second jump Cup for me it's been two days and twenty five hours holy [ __ ] we just got uncut diamond as a drop and when I came here actually thought there's a small outside chance I get this as a drop let me just have a look quickly it's a 1 in 1,600 chance of getting the diamond and I probably have killed about a thousand maybe more so it made sense that it did happen in the end but that could really skip a grind because I was thinking about going questing and stuff I might still do the questing because it does unlock the doggish and crossbow also unlocks ham stalls which would be pretty good to be fair they make a lot of money when you sell them but that doesn't mean we can just craft if I want to get this dragon dagger and dragon longsword this is going to be 60 attack coming in we can now leave and go now grind towards the dragon dagger and the dragon a longsword but we do have quite a grind to do I've got a few things I want to do I want to do a few quests and I also want to either get the crafting level to cut that diamond we got a few trips ago or get ourselves a diamond from the ham store chess which is the quest line we are going to be doing now we have a load of hubs and nature runes and iron ore to show for this grind as well which is really really helpful for the other skills as well obviously so not all wasted in terms of how slow that was it was incredibly slow took about 20 hours to get myself from 40 to 60 so yeah really really slow but that is the way it goes sometimes and I'm happy that grind is done now and I'll just show you the bank quickly and you can see how much we've got to show so here you go we have nearly 900 K worth of herbs I was primarily going for the Raynor so we have 85 prayer potions when we do get the level to do that 108 Guam's which is going to set us really well on the herbal grind once we do unlock druidic ritual then maritals will be the second one we use and I think we did get quite a few tera means as well there we go so that's like the first three potions we there and that's going to get us I think to around 20 maybe even higher so that's really good and then we have 1300 iron ore we had absolutely no iron ore before I started the grind so we can make a load of steel bars with those together and I'll probably go back to mother lode at some point and get a bit more coal together and then in terms of nature ins we have five hundred and four nature runes as well so there's a load of al King when we get to it because we don't have high out yet I don't think I'll do any low al King but maybe there might be a low out here and there if we do need a little bit of cash but yeah that high alchemy is what we're looking for but now that we can do the steel we pretty much have the ability to make steel play bodies where a couple of levels off I believe so when we do get that we'll be making a load of cash for making steel plate bodies as well which we can then sell to Harvick over there so yeah there's gonna be a lot of cash injection coming into the account currently set on only 3k at the moment but we do have all of those gold bracelets to sell as well so I yeah we're gonna be fine for cash we should have enough to actually buy the dragon dagger and the dragon longsword when it comes to it but let's start the grind on our way to getting a cut diamond all right I've got everything I need for the quest I believe we have to die one blue one orange so that and that no [ __ ] okay so I think we have to do this yeah [ __ ] sake okay cool we could get another goblin male in the in the goblin village so we'll go back and undo that now that annoyed me and honestly from here we just have to talk to the two generals and click a load of like talking things so there's not really much to show you but I'll show you the end of the quest there we go 200 crafting XP 5 quest points and a gold bar so actually helping towards the crafting grind which will I will take and the gold bar of course but that now means we can go ahead and do the Lost Tribe which gets us closer to the ham storerooms and it also means after the Lost Tribe we'll be able to use the air dog Shan crossbow which actually is probably gonna be our best bet until a very high range level in terms of training range and just using range so a really big unlock at coming our way it might be best to home teleport from here but I'll walk it out okay so we are just starting the lost tribe and what we need to do is go ahead and go through let's squeeze through this hole yes I'm sure when you collect this brooch here actually we need to get out of here we need a candle is what we need cuz otherwise I am going to die right so we've navigated through the mines and we're all good and I think we need to go ahead and perform this yes okay there we go so this is going to take us further into the quest now let's just have a quick look at what we're doing I should report back to the Juke okay cool so I believe mist I can take me out of here can you show me the way back out the mines yeah beautiful and we're gonna go continue this quest super easy we've done all the hard parts now we just got to sort of do some talking and then I'll show you the rewards there we go quest complete one quest point 3000 mining XP a ring of life which is massive on the hardcore we'll be wearing that from now on we didn't have a we didn't have a ring anyway so we're all good there and we can go and visit the doggish and mines ring of life that is never coming off at least for the foreseeable future let's jump out of here and go buy our bone crossbow although I don't know if we have enough money right now so I'm gonna sell some things off because we've got so many things to sell get the bone crossbow and then we'll probably fire on back to the quest we have ourselves a dog Crossy probably gonna buy I don't know three four let's get 500 let's get 500 for now there we go you naughty naughty thing as I said earlier this is probably gonna be the weapon we use for a lot of our range grinding seeing as we're still super area locked and then I can't really see any real things that we could get better than this at the moment so what yeah really really happy with that and obviously doing this quest that we just did means we get to unlock a chunk as well right here we go guys where are we gonna go oh no that is not helpful at all really not helpful I guess later on it will be useful when we have to go and do things in the desert but though real bad I look there but it's the way it goes you know we're not gonna get great our blog unlocks every time to be fair I've been pretty blessed for the last few so uh I was expecting a bad one there we go the grind wasn't too bad to be fair that is all the pieces that we need to give a - I can't remember what the little goblins name is but uh yeah we're gonna go see now and get this quest on the road on the road am i okay right here we go so I believe if we go ahead and try and pick like this this is all we need to do to be able to to be able to do the chests so we could go and get our diamond now but seeing as we'll get a chunk for completing this quest it seems we're all not to complete the quest so we're going to go ahead and complete the quest and then we will try and get ourselves sorry about how I'm fisted like that that's just sick that has got to be a euphemism anyway yeah once we've done this course we will try get out our cut diamond and then we'll have the dragon dagger and the dragon longsword obviously we'll need to make the money but we do have everything we need in the bank I think to make enough money for all of that good stuff so here we go you need a Jewess level 23 to squeeze through that crack can't you get through no I'm not a jollof I don't think I could get through the other you better get some agility training done you little [ __ ] Zanic right now because we went and ran round Draenor three times we can now get into this hole apparently yeah brilliant there we go [ __ ] look at this savage Zanic is an absolute savage just shooting people in the back rice it turns out zanuck might have Jesus Christ that's all looking at half that if you're gonna die you do not want to die like that do you that is at least close that [ __ ] eyes we need to collect some wishes or well or whatever the [ __ ] this is tears that's what it's called and we need to put them onto onto xaniix that she can survive right here we go we need to go ahead and kill the killer guards here so let's attack the guards that's try and get this a little bit safe spoil it so we don't have to deal with everyone look at sanic you weapon level 41 over there just absolutely sniping from afar what you love to see we don't want to deal with Sigmund though right now oh no leave [ __ ] zanuck alone all he uses protect from Rangers were protect from LA so we need to switch styles I'm guessing yeah I thank [ __ ] I brought both that is very very lucky that is gonna do it beautiful curse you links chunk and your goblin friend oh like disappears nice little animation okay I think we need to destroy this now smash the nearby drilling machine smash could just [ __ ] give it this is annek absolute you just send one in there there we go guys mm thieving and ranged XP doggish and special attacks we can now use the the special attack that we get with the crossbow entry to the ham store rooms which is what we need to get our cut diamond so we can get our dragon dagger and drag on a longsword and of course the entry to the door shank on and a chunk to unlock so uh let's go ahead and do that let's just get out of here quickly because I don't like being here right come on something decent something that opens I don't know I'd love 29 to get opened just here for the for the druidic ritual let's see what we're gonna get Oh what is that [ __ ] that is literally dead dead content so the grind now is to get ourselves a cut diamond from the hand store rooms obviously we do have that uncut diamond in the bank but we would have to get like 40 the re-crafting I believe and to be honest I could do with a bit of the money from getting all the jewelry and we can also get ourselves a strength a me magic a me all that good stuff so it's sort of like ticks a lot of boxes going and doing this oh there we go there is a sapphire amulet so that's an amulet of magic that which we will take a game's necklace there as well so a lot of these are actually gonna be quite useful to start with I think we can open another one just coins in that one unfortunately but yeah a lot of these amulets are gonna be quite useful early on right so I'm just gonna free up the inventory a little bit we're gonna be keeping these three at the bottom I'd say yeah these three at the bottom of them that I'm gonna go ahead and sell everything else off so you guys can see the sort of profit we're gonna be making 500 coins at them Oh go and sell these bad boys and as you can see the money is just rolling in I'll probably just not bother hopping for these ones at the moment but yeah usually if we had a bit more we would have hot but they go for K from just a few and we got a few useful things as well waiting on that strength a me and obviously the diamond as well I've just realized I still have my camera on hello happy Christmas everyone um diamond amulet listen that's a power army I'll take that but we do need 57 magic to craft that or enchanter even so we now have the diamond ring we have the diamond [ __ ] amulet we need just a diamond just give me a diamond can't I just like carve a diamond out of that does that work it doesn't does it you can't use a chisel on that there we go there is the strength a me do we have 49 oh [ __ ] I didn't realize the magic was that high so we need to get 10 levels and then we'll be able to enchant that into a strength a me so still no diamond but 44k we've made so far we've obviously got the doggish in crossbow we've got a strength a me ready we've got a power army ready we've got the magic a me ready I have loads of good stuff has come from what we did but we are gonna have to continue on this grind fancy dropping me a like on the video maybe subscribing appreciate it there we go we got it it didn't take too long to be fair maybe like 10 20 trips somewhere in between that not bad at all let's get out of here I think we've got enough money right now to go and get ourselves a dragon dagger so let's go ahead and do that and and see how we're looking after selling the jewelry to Grum and selling all of our gold bracelets we have 84k but before i go ahead and try and buy some stuff from Xan Auris i do want to go ahead and make all of these into steel bars and then you know sell off all the steel stuff we make as well just to see how much money we can have there we go guys got 56 K all together up to a hundred and forty-one K we need to make another 19 K and we'll be able to buy both of the dragon weaponries right here we go 171 K in the inventory I'll probably get the rune stuff later from the champ skill but right now I just really want to get myself the dragon weaponry so let's go over here we got our cut diamond you may not pass without paying the tax yeah here we go okay there's the tax thank you very much yes let's go do this let's go and do this trade with your cat boom one of those bad boys one of those bad boys oh it's way cheaper than I thought it was gonna be no it's not oh look at that on the junk account and the dragon dagger as well oh my god I'm so excited for that that is amazing we're gonna up our DPS and of course we're gonna upgrade all the XP because that took like 20 hours plus to get wow that was a long grind but now we're gonna get way way better XP right here we go guys 69 okay which I didn't mean today obviously the the gods are smiling up on us today and we're gonna go ahead and buy ourselves some rune plate legs boom oh I'm not even gonna put them on yet because I'm gonna get the whole setup together so you guys can see it but we are slowly upgrading and unlocking right so this is how we are looking starting to get they're starting to get there we've got the ring of life obviously as well the gloves we do have some BAM braces but we're not you know too bothered about that strength army incoming very soon when we get the magic level to enchant that we're looking pretty good we're getting there obviously you got the drain dagger switch as well we are slowly getting there we need a little bit more money to get ourselves maybe a rune chain body if we get ourselves another three levels we do have a two unlocks and that's probably what gonna go ahead and do now that is level 5 farming coming in which means we can now plant our onions which is gonna be a bit better XP but you know we're still we're still in the very early stages of getting these levels because obviously this is the only patch we have unlocked that is 750 total got those farming levels and then just one level in range as well so let's go and open up a chunk and see where we are - here we go guys let's see what we're gonna get please something good please something good Oh Musa point is opened up we get lobsters on the account yes oh I'm height to that finally I can just afk lobsters now yes that is so good I'm so happy about that awesome starts to open up towards Kirara as well even further Crandell looking like it could be unlocked at any minute which you love to see I am super happy about that super satisfied as quino's would say or super satisfied so that is gonna take us to the end of this episode thank you so much for watching loads of upgrades this episode we got ourselves the dog crossbow the dragon dagger the dragon longsword and of course the rune plate legs as well really upgraded our stats as well looking really really good happy with everything going next few girls are probably to get the strength up the range up and the magic up would really like to well unlock high alchemy but oh that is what its gonna be for this episode thank you so much for watching if you haven't already and I will catch you in the next one
