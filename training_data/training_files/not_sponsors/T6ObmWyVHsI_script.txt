[Music] thanks to all my patrons on patreon and excellent documentary streaming service hey safer here 2018 was a surprisingly good year for history movies that though it was also a year with a lot of movies that just weren't very popular I think Amazon and Netflix streaming might be part of that trend since those films tend not to get as much trailer hype built up before release in terms of the quality of the movies it might simply be the ones I watched but around nine movies in I only had three for the bad section of this list so I asked my patrons to vote on the next two and luckily one of those two turned out to be bad the bar set so high for 2018 that bad ones this year might have easily been good ones in previous years it's a tie for this placement and I've got to admit neither of these movies were actually bad though they might be a bit unintelligible it's a testament to how good this year was that I had to put them in the bad section when in any previous year they'd have gone in the good section the real problem with both mary queen of scots and outlaw king is they end badly just in a way I honestly don't mind one has two people meeting each other as a climax when they never did in real life and the other has a battle take place a decade before it happened and then just lets a captured King go which is super weird single combat between Kings is not really a thing otherwise these are actually good movies but I just needed something to fill in this slot by the way some folks in the comments of the Mary Queen of Scots review have been complaining about the movie depicting her with a Scottish accent and actually this is a good thing yes she grew up in France but she maintained her fluency in Scots the language they spoke in Scotland doesn't know Scots month all the garlic the Scottish accent was not what it is today I know you're coming or door purely volley up there buddy how you doing escape against a hard or no so them using that accent is clearly meant to indicate everyone speaking Scots so it's actually a nice little detail I saw a lot of negative reviews before watching Peter Liu but this movie was surprisingly good is about the eponymous massacre you get a really good sense of the time frame who was doing what and why this Massacre happened it was basically to try to put down a protest against the Corn Laws in 1819 there's a shortage of calm he won't let them import any from France or America or any worse is that Carlos yes they were meant to elbows they just make things worse and was sarcastically named Peter Lew because it happened on st. Peter's field and was referencing the Battle of Waterloo which only happened a few years prior they narrowed the subject perfectly to just a couple of weeks leading to the event then went with a fictional family to follow about the place and it's ambiguous enough to make us understand why everything is happening even the people ordering the massacre and then it shows us why it has the name we must report this heinous barbarism to the last detail this is a battlefield I Waterloo Anson Petersfield pretty brilliant the only reason why it's not higher on the list is because there's some kind of amateurish mistakes that make it boring at points it randomly plays music in the background a couple of times but that's it then there are points where we just randomly see things happening like people practicing marching and the reason for us seeing this is only given like 10 minutes later this feels like filler because that's basically what it is these problems are easy to overlook though loser for anyone who has seen the favorite just know it's based on a single angry letter sent by Lady Sarah while she was in exile no one took it seriously then and no honest person does now either the director just wanted to shove in this lesbian love triangle thing which is just patently false also the rivalry between Lady Sarah and Abigail was never violent hell even the rabbits thing is a really weird addition for no apparent reason the whole movie doesn't understand what it's talking about the actual story is about when the Tories won out for a brief period of time before the Whigs regained power for a century it was for purely political reasons why Lady Sarah fell out of queen anne's favour that is the heart of the story's conflict not this dumb lesbian stuff I don't care about costumes but people can't stop gushing over these and all of that is ridiculously out of place the actresses for Lady Sarah and Abigail look more akin to their counterparts than themselves in fact the only actor in general to look like themselves is Queen Anne I don't care about that stuff but it is kind of an integral part of the movie in either case nothing works absolutely nothing the only reason why it isn't higher on the list is because it's pretty inoffensive like it ultimately doesn't matter whether there was some secret love triangle it has no historical significance also this is that typical royal melodrama type of genre is not meant for people who care about the story nor is it meant for dudes like me in general if you find things like Downton Abbey boring then you'll be bored by this the beginning of the Afghanistan war is perfect movie material and 12 strong doesn't disappoint they cut out the boring stuff and combined a bunch of battles into one including the famous horse charge what's not to like well my main thing is that they don't show the Battle of College aangie which end of the campaign is the movies prerogative to pick their battles and that battle is decidedly nasty both in circumstance and outcome but the book covered it and the idiot critics who want to talk about Afghanistan like it's Iraq would also have been somewhat appeased I'm never in favor of appeasement but the movie could have improved with that added ambiguity of colour a Gyeonggi movies like Bohemian Rhapsody are fun if you only care about the music they function on making the musicians lives into something they weren't to be honest I was totally part of that crowd but my ignorance was ended by even the most cursory of research the whole genre is bad functioning purely off of people's ignorance if you actually read anything about Freddie Mercury with more depth than a BuzzFeed article you'd know this movie was garbage but that's the thing you have to care about Freddie Mercury himself not just the music the popularity of this genre proves people are that ignorant but honestly having been one of those ignoramuses myself that's a better argument for death of the author than anything I've ever made I've seen a lot of bad press surrounding Green Book that is seriously misinformed I think mostly because everyone wanted Black Panther to win including myself that this just seemed like a race reverse driving miss daisy' well no it's not that nor is it my fav your movie yeah I've seen a lot of frickin press saying that it's a white Saviour movie and that's stupid the family of dawn's early one of the protagonists have complained about this depiction but the only mistake in terms of familial representation is where they say he only had one brother that he never talks to I have a brother someway but it got more and more difficult to stay in touch that's verifiably false but doesn't drive the narrative those family members complaints about these two not even being friends have been proven false with both the primary sources own testimony decades after the fact so the family's more substantive complaints are either false or simply a he-said she-said situation either way the movie did pretty well for itself but it's just a fun movie they don't like it shoving up without saying sound compromised since it's going from Tony lips perspective he was quite the storyteller which eventually landed him a small role in The Godfather and then led to a number of mobster roles including good fellows and Sopranos so yeah the story is embellished but that's the story itself and we don't have any other source to go off of here my only quibble is the black and white pun intended portrayal of north and south on their trip back there's even this scene okay be careful gentlemen Merry Christmas yep they make it seem like some downtown's as in the places where black people weren't allowed to be outside in town after dark where somehow uniquely southern in fact it's exactly the opposite Mississippi only had three sundown town these places were far more common in the north and west segregation wasn't only a southern thing so it's not really a white saviour film in fact surely saves Tony twice but it is a northerner savior film best not to go south bashing if you can't admit the North's failures too it's a great film just not the best possible oh no black lensman is mostly a failed opportunity the story itself doesn't need all this embellishment there was no radical girlfriend or bomb threat yet the scenes that did happen are made somehow more boring than the book all the garbage asserting Trump is the same as David Duke is a distraction from the fact that they couldn't even make a perfectly suited story into a good movie the whole film is a garish mess first man is the best space film since Apollo 13 it is fantastic and really deals with a lot of problems surrounding NASA in a way that no other film has so successfully done Plus Neil Armstrong is a perfect vessel for the audience to see themselves so they really hit it out of the park I said in my review that this was probably the best of the year and the only reason why it isn't is because I found something better this film tries to cover a little too much time omissions are fine and necessary but making less of them while keeping the story concise is always preferable on that review I saw a lot of commenters complaining about omitting a flag planting scene honestly I think this is bad faith criticism the movie shows the flag and we don't need to see every part of a two-hour Eevee a especially considering it wasn't even Neil Armstrong who planted the flag that was Buzz Aldrin and the movie isn't about him omitting that detail is just like omitting any other it's not necessary to the narrative so it doesn't matter I can't imagine being so nationalistic as to make this omission ruin the second best history film of such a good year of history films you suck [Music] Vice is the kind of crap I expect out of the likes of Oliver Stone like they basically just remade W but with some funnier bits and a little bit of gonzo theatrics Snowden was the first film I ever gave worst of the year and this is on that level while every other bad film on this list has either not been bad or was at least palatable this is pure nonsense the movie has its moments sometimes even some incisive commentary but it's purely vindictive and often veers into conspiracy theories for instance it totally does that tired bull crap about Cheney being the power behind the throne and engineering Iraq for the sake of Halliburton Eve fabricating actual sources to say that Cheney was fabricating sources then there's the fact that the main point of the movie about the unitary executive theory is so completely wrong that even slate a fairly left-leaning magazine was complaining about the movie being leftist propaganda I mean Wow goes to show you conspiracists will spread their misanthropy no matter what their politics are kind of a pattern with these worst films conspiracy theories get you the most garbage filmmaker award tada and my cat wants to say hi oh and for those who try to excuse the film with that tired stupidity like it's just a movie or it's the comedy so stop complaining you idiots are why previous years have been so bad for movies whatever label you put on it whether it be comedy based on a true story or even inspired by real events doesn't remove the content of its story people who say that BS are so ignorant that they actually ruin whether a movie can be good or not luckily it seems that this is kind of an exception to the rest of this year [Music] now I've got a review coming out on Chappaquiddick soon enough it's already recorded but I had to get this video out as quickly as possible so I'll try not to gush too much here first this film is super timely given the 50th anniversary it also shows a significant event in American history that often gets tragically overlooked the eponymous incident was so important they interrupted coverage of Apollo 11 to broadcast the news yeah some people thought it was more important than the moon landing and now my generation is barely even aware of its existence the movie itself is tightly constructed really only following the story over a couple of weeks we really get a view of why this is so important I'm not gonna be present how bungled up the cover-up was their case was a better operation and no one comes out looking like a hero it's just great my only real complaint is that it kind of just drops you into the story without explanation so younger audience members may get lost initially but the story really draws you in especially once the cover-up commences take nothing short of them and walking on the moon to knock it off the front page fortunately for us it looks like Ted's Big Brother and range for just that seriously Chappaquiddick is a truly great film but I'll leave it at that so as to not give away too much of the upcoming review so 2018 was an exceptional year there were a couple of inoffensive bad films and a bunch of really good films only a couple of truly bad films of course this could be that I didn't see everything here's the list of films I didn't see quite a few yes but it takes time to research these things and I'm quickly running out of that especially since YouTube keeps de monetizing my videos clearly these are advertiser friendly since they literally advertised these movies but that's just YouTube's devaluing educational content I don't know if I'll have enough time to do this for 2019 it's fun and all but takes a lot of time to research and most of that research is well outside of my specialty next year I begin writing my dissertation so making enough reviews to do a top 10 list like this may be impossible I'm not saying I'm ending based on the true stories but I just don't think I'll have enough time to research and watch at least 10 films from 2019 let's just hope that 2019 does as well as 2018 did without me shoving my lantern into everything as you can see check out curiosity stream the link is in the description [Music]
