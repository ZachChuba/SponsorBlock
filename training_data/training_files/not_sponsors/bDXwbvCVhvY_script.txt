boys welcome back to the we skilled out youtube channel sorry i wanted to take a second because i am a human i'm watching the calendar i think a lot of us are leagues 2 trailblazers starts on october 28th and that is not very far away i gotta follow we skilled on twitch anyway i'm here to talk about something very sentimental something close to my heart a thing that made me feel in such a way that runescape's never made me feel before in anticipation of trailblazers starting very very soon i wanted to take a step back and just remember take a moment to remember personally i was a twisted league player i fell in love with leagues back when twisted league was happening i spent a significant amount of time there and i learned a lot of lessons i know for a lot of you it's your first time playing trailblazer if it's not your first time you're probably better at leagues than me already that's okay but i wanted to take a moment and just talk to you about what i learned from twisted league ultimately i want this to be a message of empowerment for you okay this is a video that is going to build your confidence so watch it all the way through and you'll do you'll reach your potential it's the only way now in the meantime in the background i am going to be running brim haven agility if you've been watching the channel at all you know that i've been on a little bit of a journey to level 99 agility i'm getting close we're getting there and i'm trying to smack out this last like this last little bit with a thousand tickets i've got 269 in the inventory i've got quite a few more in the bank so we are so close now this video is going to be a brief overview that's going to tell you about the feelings the principles that i got from twisted league it's kind of the shortcut because if you want to watch my full journey or what's recorded of my journey i do have a playlist on youtube it is called twisted league progress log what a uh original title but hey it's here on youtube you can watch it anytime tons of episodes honestly sick content great stuff once you're done with this video and it's still not time for trailblazer yet you might want to grind this playlist as well personally when i go through these videos and i click on any random one it's a lot of fun for me to watch the video and i i honestly think a lot of it has to do with how pretty zaya is zaya in my memory i remember the early days of twisted league i think i spent a lot of time in hosidious right away let's go with like a couple of these early videos i think i recorded myself doing a lot of like different tasks here oh man this moment right here i absolutely hate this moment because i actually spent over half an hour very very vigilantly watching the sword shop hoping to buy an adamant sword the moment that it spawned there were people underneath me waiting to buy it before i did and can i just give you the spoiler i didn't get the sword it took for ever and i didn't get the sword eventually i just went underground killed some fire giants and i got the rune scimitar that's in this clip here that was a really annoying time but like i was saying i think about zaya i think about the green all this time that i spent in hosidious it's just it's just got some really good connections in my mind i i think of zaya so so fondly so that kind of brings me to what the first lesson pretty much is what i learned in my 509 hours of playing twisted league the first thing that i want to say what i learned in 509 hours of twisted league is that you had better get ready for a journey of learning it doesn't matter if you're already an old school runescape expert there's different things in this league that change the rules just a little bit that honestly no one really knows what the best thing is to do at any given point we don't know what truly the best areas are we don't know what the best relics are and even when it's all over even when the dust blows over if we look at the number one player's account we don't actually know if what they did was the best path or if they just worked harder than everyone else and if i'm gonna give my prediction it's because they worked harder than everyone else so what i learned is that really really really this is all just a huge journey of learning there's so many lessons that i that i learned throughout all like the specific things i suddenly had to learn all the little exits of the catacombs i have to show you something very very shameful that's true about my account right now by going over to the quest tab and clicking on the purple yeah even though i'm a huge twisted leagues fan i don't have 100 percent favor in all of the zea houses i was around when zaya was released i was around when the system was you got a hundred percent but you weren't able to lock it in and if you trained a different house it would uh lower your other houses that you put so much time into and they've i've watched the updates and changes happen as time it just so happens i've never once done it on my main account whatever what else did i learn so so much about zaya i learned how to get favor efficiently and twistedly it was a great time i learned what it was like to chop redwood trees for the first time i learned what it was like to train runecrafting and a little bit of magic at the arceus library i learned that so well that as soon as twisted league was over i went over to the rcs library in the main game and trained up to level 77 runecrafting which eventually snowballed into me getting all the way to level 99 runecrafting that's one thing that twisted league did to me now i could keep talking about zaya for a long time you can tell you can tell that twisted league affected me very greatly i thought that isaiah was important for the game that it was cool that it was nice that they were in making new content making new lands they weren't just sticking with the land that already existed i thought that was cool but it wasn't until i was thrown into the fire in twisted league that i eventually found out what zaya really was all about and it became this beautiful living land that i love to this day i think it's so cool i could keep talking about zaya but that's not going to help you on your trailblazer journey the point that i'm trying to make is that as you progress through trailblazer you're going to learn new things you're going to find out things about these regions that you're going to be restricted but this is not going to affect you on your trailblazer journey the point is you are going to learn you're going to love the regions that you take so don't make this a soulless decision right don't just say well i think that mauritania is going to give me the best points so i'm willing to spend all 70 of these days in a swamp listen we're not all swamp lettuce we can't all keep happy with no sunlight on our accounts all i'm saying is the swap's kinda dreary it might get weird in there it might get not so fun pick the places that you think you're gonna have fun pick the places that you're gonna love even if you don't you probably are going to end up loving them and i hope you get ready brace yourself to absolutely fall in love with old school runescape all over again i freaking love leagues it's so good so that's number one it's a journey of learning moving on to get to the second point i wanted to tell you the story my story of what happened on the first day of twisted league let me take you all the way back before we've been having this bad year 2020 whatever man it's november 14th how young we were november 14 2019 i groggily got out of bed i checked my phone not not saying that this is the best thing to do or it's not the best thing to do every morning wake up open your eyes be on your phone immediately but this is what i was on november 14 2019 and i remember because i opened up a message and it was a message from one of my mods i didn't think of him as my mod i thought of him as my friend back then my how things have changed and he said i'm playing he said something along the lines of i'm playing twisted league i'm rank like top 100 in total level right now and i was like oh that's cute that's really fun i've heard a little bit about twisted league i'll check it out i'll log on and then things kind of changed i logged on spawned in the middle of zaya had an axe had a tinder box started chopping trees right away because that's what everyone was doing we were surrounded by people just chopping trees because the first goal was to get to winter todd and i was having just an absolute blast you know the amount of dopamine that you get from popping up multiple levels like in a single log that didn't actually happen but uh popping levels like crazy not getting interrupted when you level up until level 30 because there's so many levels that you get immediately those level up messages are actually so annoying you get so much dopamine it's a great time it's absolutely awesome but i started playing twisted league and then i started making videos and then i started just grinding i was like in the dragon cup zone for most of the time but then i kind of burned out in the last couple of weeks and just didn't play for the last couple of weeks rip rip dragon cop now did you hear that story did you did you get what i was getting at i didn't exactly highlight it so let me tell you now i woke up on november 14th not really knowing what twisted leak was and i logged on and i said i was in the dragon cup zone for most of the league i ended up with a rune cup top five percent of players in reality i was in the top 1.5 but that was me someone who didn't theorycraft at all i didn't talk about twisted league i didn't know it was gonna be so fun i didn't know it was gonna change my life but that's lesson two you don't have to theorycraft you do not have to theorycraft league to do well i promise you it's a-okay in fact uh my friend who did the best i don't know what kind of like xy axis you need to get here but like the my closest friend who did the best in tw enter in twisted he has said on multiple occasions that he is purposefully not thinking about trailblazer at all but he's gonna get dragon again and i believe him and i know that that's true so i promise you you do not need to theorycraft to do well in league hey it might help you it might make you a little bit more confident but what we're doing here is ultimately fun not important it is fun i promise you that all right everybody can i tell you a little something about content creation there's some there's just something beautiful about a rule of three and i think i accidentally bled into my final point over and over again while i was talking about the first couple of uh of points that i was making so take it from me like i'm not the best content creator but but this might feel a little disappointing but i've got you with the uh with the with the emotional point three point three what i learned from 509 hours in twisted league is that it okay you guys are gonna hate this it's uh it's odd my last point is that leagues is absolutely unbelievably fun maybe we should talk a little bit more like specific things that i did learn about because it was a lot but oh my goodness you guys are gonna have fun if you if you just take a dip in play some trailblazer the thing is is that i really do want to say this and and like i really mean this so so much because my few connections in the old school runescape community when i talk to them i notice and it's not a competition but they're not as excited about trailblazer as me and i've always been a little taken aback when someone's not as excited as me then i have to take a step out of my body and realize brian you're a little energetic you're a little just generally energetic compared to other people i have to realize that about myself but i always feel so bad when i see people who are currently grinding theater of blood you know they're a top tier player already and then they're like oh trailblazer that's coming out what is that like dead man mode lame it's like king of the king of the skill lame i don't want to waste 70 days doing something that just disappears and i just gotta say give it a try give it a try trailblazer is going to feel so fun leagues are and i am not exaggerating here my favorite thing in all of gaming currently specifically the league's mode the special leagues mode of old school runescape it is a absolutely magical thing to see all the players spawn all at once we're gonna be slapping it out together out out in mistland out in lumbridge it's gonna be so amazing it's so cool seeing everyone getting the full full opportunity to wear whatever they want because they have they don't have to worry about run energy we're not all wearing full graceful everywhere we go everyone you can just express themselves in so many different ways everyone has unique account builds when you're when you're playing old school runescape the land is really really big you don't know what worlds people are in the likelihood that you run into a content crater it's fun for me i really like doing that i got to cross paths with mudkip and twisted league and i had that blew my mind that personally that blew my mind i had a oh i loved twistedly i had so much fun and i know that i'm gonna have a ton of fun in league again that's the biggest point that i wanted to make if you're on the fence give it a try man play the game long enough to unlock all the relics unlock all your areas if you're playing casually it'll take two weeks easy easy and fun the entire way through boys if you're watching this on youtube take a second to comment what are
