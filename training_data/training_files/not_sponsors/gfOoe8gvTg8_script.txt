[Music] [Music] what a way to start the month of May in the world of Microsoft Flight Simulator as May kick-starts we received the development details over the next three months including a hint of moving to a closed beta we will cover this all in this week's episode welcome to another Microsoft Flight Simulator update video this is where we bring you all the news and updates of the development of this new a flight sim if you're lazy like me and you don't want to troll the net for all the latest updates in this a video is for you as a may kick starts the team at Microsoft Flight Simulator lay down the development plans I'm right through to July including a TBA for a closed beta so by the looks of things the development of this new flight seems seemed to be in full flight we'll cover this in the roadmap shortly so first let's talk about deliverables we have been waiting for episode 8 IFR for a long time now but it seems we have to wait a little bit longer but we've been saying that we do have a targeted date for the 28th of a May the partnership update has been pushed back all the way to early June so I'm not much in a video content is on the way in the month of May to wet our flight sim appetite updates for alpha build the Microsoft Flight Simulator team have started the preparations for releasing the upcoming a builder they mentioned that they have spent a few extra days incorporating a number of fixes for the Airbus a320 which was the base of the feedback from their testing community they have completed that integration and are just running up a couple of final passes to ensure everything is a working alpha build a 1.3 is scheduled for release at this stage in the week of a May 11 so fingers crossed we will see the new alpha and next week I'm thinking or we will see that on the 14th of a May in all things alpha invitations the team have been working on two key areas when it comes to alpha invitations the first one is and now complete which was doing sure that everyone has received an acceptance email has access to the alpha the second key area was a new round of invitations study and next week in tandem with the new alpha build that's right if you have registered may receive an invitation to the alpha build next week the week of May 11 so the best of luck with your environment or more exciting news in the development of Microsoft Flight Simulator with this week the release of the updated feedback snapshot of version 4.1 so the top questions that are being asked are by the flight team community is aircraft that list Airport list a big improvement plan and update of frequency campaign mode emissions and our progress damage model fully functional airports minimum specs which have been answered but has raised a lot more questions and nav data update frequency pre-order timeline release date and a pricing model so nothing really has changed there since we saw the last feedback snapshot taking a look at the top alpha issues was the a320 autopilot auto for us cockpit display and extra so it sounds like there was a few bugs which they spent a few extra days of fixing for the next coming alpha release camera issues installation issues insufficient and draw distance on other planes online manual caching that are not available preferable support a pitch of poverty on FBX flight mode pitch and your stability at terrain and diem issues and a World Airport data offsets and in everybody's top our wish list for Microsoft Flight Simulator is a third-party content SDK AI traffic ATC helicopters peripheral supports for advanced setup seasons share cockpit functionalities a VR and a track I ah but I'm sure there should be a more added to the list with the latest release of the development roadmap and it's out and it really looks like the Microsoft Flight Simulator 10 is really pushing to have this flight sim out for all of us to enjoy in 2020 they have been working hard on this roadmap and it has been pushed back a few times which it says to me they have been really working on their milestone dates and it should be a pretty solid so let's break each month down so taking a look at the deployment update for the month of May so may the seven which is this one is the feedback snapshot for alpha 2 is the development roadmap update for a June and July in a MIDI update next week we should see alpha version 3 on the 14th of May SDK update and also a and MIDI update on a May 21st will be another development robe update for a June and July and also a medium update so that one's going to be pretty light on it and on a May the 28th we should see the feature discovery series episode 8 for IFR that we're all been waiting for feedback snapshot for alpha 3 and also another media update moving on to June in early June we're gonna see alpha version 4 we're gonna see our partnership announcement series release 4 and meter blue in mid-may we're gonna see a partnership announcement series a release for a navy-blue feedback snapshot for alpha version 3 SDK update and in light of June we're gonna see alpha version 5 partnership announcement series released for FlightAware and another media update and in early July we're gonna see a partnership announcement series TBA so they haven't announced this month so it'd be interesting to see or what it will be we'll have a feedback snapshot for alpha version of 5 and in mid-july we're gonna see a closed beta introduced so that's a very exciting getting that another little step closer to having this sim released in 2020 so the Alpha does have a shelf life and it's coming to a close we're also gonna see another partnership and announcement series which will be TBA they have an announced that one will also have a development road update for August and September I think that's gonna be a really interesting that will give us a lot of insight to say a when this flights in that will be released in 2020 we'll also get a feedback snapshot for alpha version 5 SDK update and in late July we're going to see another partnership announcement series release but TBA so we don't know what that one is also so summer really exciting news and it's looking like the Alpha shelf-life is expiring soon and we will be moving to and used to development and now that we know this I would love to hear in the comments below or what is your prediction of the release date for Microsoft Flight Simulator in 2020 the last section of this week's update was a community spotlight on the alpha testers who have taken some amazing shots including some video
