there we go jet kill count number two baby and then the big moment do we get the pet no pet we got a new personal best though there's only one thing left to do and that's trade up the fire kick give me the pit baby not lucky all right well it was fun 2096 steel bars I have to make it two cannonballs I told you guys lost episode I had iron to making the steel bars well here they are I got a little bit of a fkn to do and we've run into the loss to a hundred molten glass we're just about to hit halfway to 77 but we hit 76 it's time to boost for the glory let's go Brad don't mind the hard clue on the floor is I it's complicated all right it's an Eastern Green Dragon step I can't do what it's multi I don't do multi I do single but we got three other clues a beautiful snap of fire ain't no misfire lighter and a studded body T let's move on make the crystal keys open the chest hopefully we get some room plate legs or some uncut so it'll be nice iron oh we're actually not bad three room bars I'll take it another key and 100 coal perfect actually a lot of weight did I already have all these long rooms either way let's cut these dragon stones on our way to edgeville and let's get ready to rumble that's my house cringe okay here we go let's not get as unlucky as last time I just need a +4 baby you Inc Oh first try so easy make the dragon stone amulet I should I need to make two I need to make two because I have one clue step chit chat chit chit chit where my dragons don't have and that should be two oh forgot my ball of wool please don't die on me mister boost there we go that is two dragons too listen now we can finally do the elite clue that's been in my bank for such a long time bring a foraging and Halston was bracelet and Dragons to an amulet this is also step number four so hopefully we can get the casket on this one and there we go the first amulet of glory alright I'll get the boost again I guess [Music] [Music] yeah gaskets and then the elite glue them you can never say I'm a [ __ ] again on this hardcore Ironman I did wildy clue on stream multi combat there it is the heart clue here we go number 18 that's a flex this is a bit annoying because I need the shield I already got a h3 or a heralding helmet and it's even the same one did oh that's so annoying we got the room cane which is a big flakes not gonna lie but the heraldic shield would have been way better that would have been locked another two hard clues but hey oh my god this looks horrible Jesus ancient staff acquired if you guys didn't know after the desert press request you can get an ancient staff for 80k from people it's been only one so if I lose this right now I might have to do crazy archaeologists or some [ __ ] so I could not lose this thing I don't know how I would lose it if I don't drop it I can't die so I mean alright just got done with a cone art ask 273 points we'd have a bunch of slayer points actually I was running out first thing I'm going to do is unlock or like extend dust devils cuz that task was incredible so that's the first thing we're gonna do boom and then we have four cone our keys or brimstone keys that we're going to open I'm hoping for um actually just cash just alcohols really let's see what we can get diamonds I'll take it gold or not really necessary now those are alcohols and then dragon arrow chips fair enough the broken dragon house that would have been beautiful but we got another [ __ ] task ready for jet KC number three baby geez there it is one for personal best I think my previous almost one for and then like something a little higher than that I think I beated by a couple seconds alright boys I have a fire Cape here I will bargain it oh not lucky not lucky come on give me that bottomless bucket please twenty four kill count unlucky yes right before we're gonna get the Slayer level on the superior let's go you know this is a bunch of XP in one place kind of want an imbued hard on the hardcore knocking a lot forty force lyric speed left til that 72 I wanted to say the big 72 it's not that baby breath is going pretty quick with the Slayer levels and here we go 3000 XP we got a dark totem middle one more part before we can do Scotties oh but I need a couple more ancient charms Cazale legit don't have an arc light yet I only have two ancient shards so far but the first goatees I was slowing slowly coming up rewind for a second let me tell you what the goal is for the actual next episodes right now I'm grinding Slayer not just for Slayer XP even though in the long run we want the dragon boots and the abyssal whip but actually because I want to stack up 70 prayer this weekend I want to do a big barrows grande again for the tank legs and for a full barrows ARMA set because we still have that monster clue now if we can get 70 prayer bang through Slayer that'll be amazing after that the goal is to get 65 or 70 smithing so I can unlock current and cables hard Diaries so I could start doing shamans for that dragon Warhammer slowly but surely I want to start working on my rate setup I know I'll lead a couple of herb-lore levels for that but I'm really slowly looking for all those gear upgrades so in short 70 prayer Barrow set in tank legs 70 smithing dragon Warhammer raids very very broad but that's the plan oh yes yes yes I got him oh that was so close 48 kills iron drag is this is why I picked this Slayer Tomsk I'm never gonna do this again probably even though it was actually quite alright killing these guys without an anti fire just face thank them what protect melee I melt through them quite well with Ivan blast but I'm really happy we can actually make the room crossbow now it's 69 fletching which we will train very soon but at least we don't have to do any crazy archaeologists or hope to get it from an elite glue so it's all good alright back at this place have 8,100 rocker ambulance to cook that will be enough for quite some time planets to cook 7600 so that means I can only burn 500 why because that will get our cooking up to 82 at 82 with cooking gloves and in this hoe sidious kitchen i do not burn monkfish anymore and as you could see a second ago I have 5200 monkfish in the bank which hopefully will get us the 85 cooking that is a goggle 'evil for wild pies and since I'm doing some big Slayer from 82 Slayer onwards I'm gonna try and boost for a whip I know everyone's getting flashbacks from how bad it was on trails but I'm listing from 82 not from 80 so it's a little better here we go make this into the ark look our Clyde baby and now I completely forgot is a predict may lie when you yeah particularly when you hit time to rip the hardcore talking about ripping the hardcore this is a little flashback from a couple hours before this moment ring of life [Music] I should be fine if I'm not fine well then I'm just a bad player at the game no hits but the ArcLight spec alright tank there we go final hit no final hit now then nope no then that's it yes that's it first go tease Oh kill what is it gonna be 100% hard clue that's nice but what else grimy Snapdragon oh my god that'll lead diary tasks I thought I got the pit for a second not even joking not bad 20 Grammys snapdragons not mad about it and a non Willy step you're ruining all the kite shield I really really really need that too so let's go dammit wrong kite shield wrong kite shield doesn't count as I roll that one but uh it's sight alright just got done doing my arms big adventure or making friends in my arm but some nice herbal or and farming speed I really just did it to complete the hard clue I'm stuck on because I need it the rock what is it music track so let's head on over to Fowler and try and finish this hard clone and the rip don't know why but suddenly I'm questing king's ransom completed a bunch of defends XP 5k reward lamb that'll go straight on arm lore and yeah I guess keep question or something no I'm feeling it today these are such obscure quests I've never done what lies below done 8000 runecrafting hey speed don't mind if I do and the scorpion catcher a done I don't know why suddenly came into dis quest but I was just scrolling through my list and saw this one wasn't completed so that's the tale of two cats completed this took a while man I don't know if I need this really but probably from Dragon Slayer to us or whatever that is even more herb Lorex piece so that's a 5000 hey that's a little bit of prayer XP another slice of ham only 19 more twists to do till the quest Cape ah this quiz I forget I'll always forget how long it is but it's not great I don't like it at all don't know what this camerawork is supposed to be but it's not smooth at all there we go now build a penguin suit sig did almost a jillion level up which is great um I think there's one more I want to do today on the road 270 prayer we complete the Great Brain robbery one of the few quests I still have to do I only have about 18 quest left of the quest game unfortunately no prayer level but maybe with this blast lamp there we go 55 baby should have put that on herblore not gonna lie I was a little bit impulsive with that one there it is fourth jet kill new personal best to ask number 165 done alright let's see if we can get lucky today any Petters in through trails fashion I just missed my 1,700 total but we got a slayer level 74 Slayer 1700 total another big milestone a slayer task is just done and hopefully some crust for a leaf blade at battle axe more blue dragons fair enough I need that 70 prayer ASAP finally after having a drop about five heart Clues during a slayer a small grind situation I finally have a casket so hard glue number 23 incoming hey a new blessing not bad new room plate lace or like another pair of room plate legs and the ancient page in that book of darkness is a thing I still kind of want and it is unique so we almost have the book of Darkness completed really nice there's two books we almost have completed now decently closer to Bandos one so yeah quick opening up brimstone keys because I want to start doing Slayer again but I want to show you guys the brimstone keys I've got a dust devil tusk so that is actually insane coins is great alcohol's is great alcohol's is even better let's go right because we're going for 70 prayer right now and I might as well unlock the Red Dragons because apparently Red Dragons and forth those dungeon are incredible for prayer XP if you use them on the outer there and you can also get a little bit of money by Al King and crafting the red D hide things there we go next task Burstyn baby is a slayer level by the way an 80 magic wow wow wow easy boost with a wizard mind mom now to make the arrow is a portal for the Barrows grind soon yo is 75 Slayer that is one of the bigger toughs in the game of lock being gargoyles unfortunately I don't have a leave bladed battle knives but I think the best way for me to do gargles when we finally get the tusks is my gut and spear think that what might be my best crush weapon I have at the moment it is a milestone nevertheless these cotizo pet actually I would like an elite clue to be very honest and leak glue grimy snapdragons again that's back-to-back only one that's the exact same drop is my very first cotija what all right let's try and do this clue on ancients though that's not really fun yes we got the casket from Scotty's oh so that's already good now get to our lucky place which is Casa Lars I'm glad it's not in the will do I have to drop so many clues already during this Slayer grind so oh my god that might be a page we don't have yet all right we only have one our middle page so this is for sure a new one there we go so we're close to about four books now very close to the ancient and a gothics one but kind of close to the banners at the are middle one which is the arm don't one in the book of darkness are by far the two best ones so not bad a number five new personal best best day by four minutes jab pet no jad bed but not lucky unlocking all the Willy tracks with this one well we're almost there and then we can get the hell out I'm getting a little bit more risky in the wilderness now that I have the glory so because I can leave at level 30 now which is good please nobody will be oh well this one again I just got this step Oh hard cool number 27 boom oh that's a good alcohol clue I'm liking that alright don't judge my outfit I just got done with a blue dragons task let's see how hard we've been gaming this episode I want to calculate how much
