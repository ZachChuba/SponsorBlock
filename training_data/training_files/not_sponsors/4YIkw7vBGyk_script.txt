you know that right oh boy that thumbnail looks like this the live tax the stream yeah right now we're live now we're trying to figure out how the heck streaming works now that line is is gone because we haven't used the YouTube dashboard a long time we're gonna have a great show we have tons of news we have more updates on on your Blizzard on my fancy stuff escapades at this point yeah yeah we're gonna talk about the next folding phone from Samsung yes so we have a topic literally just called Huawei UK so that's that's awesome and Eve when I first read this title I thought we were talking about the video game but no we are talking about the like crowd-sourced monitor yeah yeah you ready five yeah okay girl yeah good good that's gonna be all the conversation actually so yeah catch us after the intro there we are this is so weird now that this is the intro that's just been going on for years like why are these guys in the jungle why the canary there's no contact for any of it used to be see really change all the time I mean it literally [Music] this place and the LBG store which we have our own sponsor wait for why isn't it just LTTE store calm why is it OMG GG / ym ltd store okay alright that's fine analytics is guide beta these days how are you I'm tired you know but I'm okay um yeah I'm thumbnail woah do that when you want to do that literally right now I'd have to like title it and everything no I'll do that yeah that's silly dad's baloney yeah I agree thanks for asking sorry things are fantastic here at LMG there's so much action lately how is a house bit this this will be an interesting conversation we won't talk about a way to long but how was being a part of LMG and singing - do the retiring stream oh I felt I don't know I thought that I assumed everyone had the same reaction that I did because but I heard that the next day people who work here we're reaching out to them being like you okay but I saw it I was like yeah I knew that already like I knew that for the last whatever the amount of time a year or something he's thought about these kinds of things and especially when earlier last year the channel was like dipping he really was sensitive to that and was trying to think of all the different things he could do but and that was great and that's how you survive in this business I think that's why we've gotten as far as we have yeah because he takes that seriously reevaluate everything is like what about our title is whatever our thumbnails were over the stuff recovering and audience sentiment didn't everything work on all of that and also diversify revenue revenue streams and yeah survive so yeah I saw that stream and I saw immediately from the tightening of it I've been thinking about retiring I was like okay this is not any announcement of anything actually happening yeah I love like there was there was so many people debating about like I wish it wasn't so click baby and I was like it wasn't though it was actually one of the least click baby things if you know Linus you know it's he's not wrong you know not lying with that title you should also know that it's supposed to be clique worthy it's it's like we're yeah click worthy not technically because it's very try night I don't mean to say that I think that his motions were contrived or put on at all like he's being authentic in that video 100% but I wasn't worried by it yeah at all no I actually did message him after I watched it I was like bro I'm down to make any environmentalism videos that you want I always have weird little questions like when I'm just going through my building like I wonder how much energy per year these lights that always stay on use or how much energy does my elevator take should I take the stairs or or like when I'm streaming music do you know how much just like - elevator rides a day I did a casual look up on an elevator and this it wasn't a deep dive of the things that I read were like because of the counterweight systems they don't take that much energy ok but that might still be like a lot of energy but maybe just not that much yeah but ok lies is fine alright so - it's fine you want to start with the the Warcraft stuff first what the game will on there's just so much more exciting stuff to talk about klm gee like today I hosted o for a new channel I don't know if Lance's talked about I'm not gonna talk point it's on full plane which is why I'm talking about it at all yeah it's public knowledge to some people but yes we are starting a new channel which is cool the name yeah I'd probably give him that I don't know no you can subscribe I'm flow play to see the name hey yeah we'll leave you hanging but I'll throw my own little and if you're on a full plane you can actually subscribe to the channel cuz there's a link to the channel Oh actually YouTube channel has been created it doesn't have any videos on yet it doesn't have any visual assets yeah one of the first well you yeah there's like 200 subscribers in this plane and another thing that's awesome here is a new podcast we have yes that's been out for a while since like all of 2020 but there's a new LMG podcast that's not the land show it's basically it's an audio only podcast that's not on YouTube although it is on floatplane in video form and it's called carpool critics why is it called that so it's mean Riley and David and David's camera person here Riley's on tech linked and me I'm here right now the three of us and Lloyd used to carpool together we all looked at Vancouver but then Riley moved like an idiot yeah and it sucked because we saw these really sick conversations in our car Perl all the time you know and it's just a millennial white dude you're like every time you have a good conversation this should be a podcast we should be recording this right now there was a lot of that and then when Riley moved we were like man we in this Riley I wish we could find a way for Linus to pay us to hang out together again and so we pitched last idea of having a movie podcast and you loved it I think in part because of the whole retiring speech thing it's like we need to think of new ways yeah yeah yeah create this Empire so yeah he liked the idea and we've been doing I think we've released 10 episodes we've recorded probably 13 but some of them didn't pick it but we there's 10 now in full force and you can get it wherever you listen your podcast and it's fun I told I thought your your comment about the like just talking makes you think you should make it a podcast thing it reminded me of uh I think about two months back I sent Linus a message almost like we should have an off topic podcast so we can just like have an excuse to hang out more so yeah we can monetize it'll probably happen more often I mean people don't not want that there's tons of podcast you listen to it's just to people that you think are interesting talking for like three hours you're just driving or cooking or whatever yeah and so this podcast is a little bit of that a little bit of movie analysis new movies old movies and it's awesome carpool critics where we get your podcast and you can follow the Twitter we're just carpel critic site at twitter and you can email us to have we've applied it so here's that here's a question for a for a podcaster and you can't answer your own what is your favorite podcast oh I have a got shortlist but one that I really admire is reply all a lot of our listeners will know that one it because it's tech and internet culture focus those guys are so funny then I love reply all do you know this podcast no it's awesome nada I'm not very much on the I'm not a very podcast you should check it on your drive home this shorter too and they do awesome like super tech support things where someone would be like why am I getting random charges from uber and Romania and I'm like okay I'm gonna find this out for you and those go and do some journalism and come back with a really interesting story that's kind of guys it's a great podcast I I'm very into the audiobooks really books really hard I got a couple I do like very high double digits every year for sure really it probably in like the 30s or 40s I was into that until we started Oh same with podcast all that ended when I started carpooling that makes sense to be fair yeah I'm almost always alone in the car and then I'll get way too into it and then just sit in the car yeah yeah I have to get to the end of this bit I did dune by audiobook and I was like on the Sky train just pretending I'm on the phone I don't wanna buy Bluetooth headphones my face I saw a note in here that your Blizzard thing has been resolved yeah you were banned on Blizzard for likes you're suspended for six months from wow I was suspended for six months from Wow for cheating was the original thing that they told me and then I pestered them a million times with a whole bunch of different tickets and they eventually told me that it was for unauthorized external program use is I think the exact way they phrased it but I could be so they tell you that after you got in the live chat with the guy know the live track guy just wouldn't he was yeah he was a jerk and he wouldn't just he wouldn't say anything okay um so this was this was email correspondence from before that and he referenced I believe he didn't say what email specifically but I believe he was talking about that email that said unauthorized third party program he's after that last LAN show and I think in large part the lmg clip that was made of that segment someone reached out and got me a phone number of someone at Blizzard that I was going to call but literally before I could call them I was going to call them and like minutes I received a call from the actual called you they called me they found my oh the number what did the number come up as right it was a random number and I was staring at it being like I don't want to pick up my screen call like right before I did that it flipped to like Blizzard Entertainment okay like screenshot so yeah I answered it and I don't know like to what level of detail they want me to slowly go into because I know that their reason for not wanting to give me more details was that they don't want it to help people avoid bands but no there was no external program they didn't even necessarily they had they had no like particular program in mind they just had a suspicion that I was using one and they they did some stuff to kind of solidify the decision that they thought I was using one but they had no like there was no like oh we there are application detected this running on your computer there was none of that there it must have been some kind of all like algorithmic flagging I don't yeah I don't want to go like way too into it but effectively no I wasn't so they unbanned me huh that is the conclusion but and like well it's a good thing your lukla friend yang so this is this is where like and I've told some people including my my dad and my brother and my mom who I play well with and I brought this up a million times that like this part sucks but I think for a journalistic integrity reasons I have to bring this up even if it compromises my account in the future but yeah that's terrible the only reason I got unbanned was because of this show yeah which like thank you guys for creating a ruckus and thank everyone for thanks to everyone for like tweeting them and sending emails and contacting people that you know what Blizzard because the guy on the phone was like yeah I heard from everyone about this so we decided to look into it and it's cool that they did that and unbanned you it just sucks that that's not available to everybody yes and like the the communication up to that point was horrible yeah the tickets that I that I sent in no-one ever I had no legitimate conversations and then by the time I actually did have a legitimate conversation the guy was just a jerk yeah and like super sassy and completely really curb and tell they're like yeah I'm tagged and then they open the velvet rope oh right this way sir yeah like that that battle.net account has CD keys on it from 20 years ago yeah and has purchased every single game they've ever released all this kinda stuff mate they found a very dedicated customer and just six-month band out of nowhere and then like the first communication that I sent out being like what even just happened part of the response was like yeah well usually this would have been a permabanned so like you should be thankful sending in tickets so like I don't know the the communication from them was was really terrible I'm happy I'm unbanned but I feel bad for like every kid out there that didn't do anything wrong and is also banned for six months or permanently if that was well I don't think they do perma bans anymore I think that was their comment was like this used to be a permit that used to be yeah okay I might have said that wrong but they were they were saying like yeah the same thing used to be a perma ban so yeah I don't know I feel I'm happy I got unbanned but if I feel I didn't do anything wrong and I don't know if this is the right emotion but I almost feel guilty just because I know there's other people out there in the same spot and they're still banned and they can't do anything about it and that makes me feel bad deserve to be bad I'm laughing because you could take the word banned and exchange it for something like way more serious on in jail we're only talking about being bad it sucks yeah there are worse things but yeah and there's still other parts that sucked like I I lost that time like I lost that progress and there's certain things in the game where like what for us like like PvP competitive ranking stuff if you if you don't do it it your your rank decays oh yeah so why was banned I like D ranked oh man sucks and like there's a bunch of other stuff but like ultimately doesn't matter mm-hmm the only thing is just how frustrating the whole experience was and the fact that if I did not work here I would still be banned that's that's the part that really frustrates me that's important the reason why I'm like I'm happy I'm unbanned what I'm still actually really mad is because most people would not make me get out of this situation who knows maybe they'll change something after they see this so this is one thing I want to drop it because the the phone call was relatively short at night there's I thought of a bunch of stuff I should have brought up afterwards and then if I called it back it would just go to some random number except on of the extension but if you guys want help reforming your customer service hall at you boy I've got some ideas for you that was that was a terrible experience and I have many ideas of how you could improve it and I would be happy to help free of charge I'm imagining just like the most white glove phone caller they call you up and they're like you know your rank isn't gonna decay in fact we're gonna use extra double plus I don't know it's way too you know you like been dressed I know it's not gonna it's not gonna change the tone of the conversation but yeah I would just like to help you fix it Blizzard's been in a bad way for a long time and we're gonna talk more about that later on in the show we talked about Warcraft 3 reforged and potentially one of the lowest rated games for user scores on Metacritic of all time and why it's so low and I honestly think why don't we just talk about it right now let's do it I think therefore surprisingly related issues and the high that unban me is probably so pissed right now because this show is so negative well you should have said to Peter yeah they're perfect I lied before you like stuffed-crust yes stuffed yeah but Warcraft 3 reforged it has a Metacritic critics score of 63 although I noticed WCC F Tech one of our favorite sites to bring up on LAN show gave it a 75 although their opening statement with giving it a 75 this blows my mind is work after reforged isn't the game that was promised but 75 but 75 okay well without going any further I can see how that might happen like today at lunch I'm talking to Jake about Star Trek and he's saying how he loved discovery and okay I haven't seen the show but the consensus I've heard so far is like yeah it might be an okay show but it's it's not start check Star Trek is about going to new planets and experiencing new cultures and figuring it out and figure out what it means to be human and in Discovery as far as I can tell it's more about interest ship drama and not about going to new places so Jay who's like born in the year 2000 and doesn't have the all the Canon all they're like this reference point he just sees this show as he sees other shows and is like it's like if you go on with that without those expectations and all that baggage it's a good show so is that what they're saying here if you had no expectations if you do know what Blizzard was promising it's a good game potentially because the next part of that line is but it is still a valuable reconstruction of one of the most influential titles in the history of video games so I think they gave it a 75 because Warcraft 3 was really good so what it was promised there's so in terms of the promises there's a few issues there I don't know enough about this and if you want to learn more about it there's some actually like very good videos on YouTube detailing all of the issues with Warcraft to reforge but I'll go over what I do understand part of the issue as far as I know is that some of the the especially the cinematics there's one cinematic in particular that's quite egregious and is actually still in the Warcraft 3 reforged website as far as I know as of right now it was like I think nine ish hours ago but I don't know if it still is but the trailer for the game talks about like new awesome cinematics and they have an example of one that example is the same thing that they showed at Blizzcon that example is not in the game oh okay and like the equivalent of that cinematic is way worse and most of the cinematics in Generation Y ways they're dressing than the equivalent like it's the same one it just like lower res or like basically instead of a cinematic if I remember correctly and again you should probably go to a better source for this if you're if you're all that interested but it's it's basically just like a lowered camera angle of the unit's talking instead of an actual proper cinematic okay and what was advertised looked like more of a cinematic they might be able to get away with it by being like no that was a trailer that we mentioned new and improved cinematic scene but we weren't talking about that part okay even though that part was a cinematic from work f3 like they could probably hop and skip their way through it but yeah it's just kind of awkward then so if you move past the like cinematic and graphics and stuff that people do have some amount of issue with and there were they were apparently possibly going to be changing the story and then they they renege to that which was probably a good move and a few others like retconning Wow yeah don't even reckoning it's like revisionist yeah that was just kind of weird because StarCraft Stark I've got reforged or whatever I don't know if it had the same title but it got remade and basically they just up to the graphics yeah and then we're like there you go but they didn't even up them that much it still had the kind of spirit of the originals yeah I don't think anyone could get mad really no sweet bonus probably what they should have done here the really egregious part in my opinion and I'm pretty sure this is why it has a user score of 0.7 and I think this is really why everyone is so mad if it was just the cinematics I could see some like lowered scores and some people being kind of upset but I think this is where people go go kind of off-the-wall is they changed how the custom game stuff works and Warcraft 3 like I played Warcraft 3 an amazing amount I ended up buying multiple copies of the games kept on losing my darn cd-key the only thing I ever played I play the campaign like once maybe twice and then custom games forever because custom games and Warcraft 3 were amazing you mean they just changed like the interface or no so they added a bunch of rules which probably make a lot of sense and other companies have started doing these things as well where they have more rights to your content and controlling your content and a lot of that comes in with like you can't use other IPs in this game so you can't have like super mario bros tower defense in Warcraft 3 because that's an issue for a bunch of reasons and that existed in the original Warcraft 3 that wasn't really a problem but the landscape has shifted and this might be an issue named Zelda we tower defense yeah probably so like there was some stuff like that I don't think anyone cares about that part the issue was they added on a thing where they owned outright everything that you do with no like they don't have to pay you for any of it or anything titles are as far as I know it's literally everything oh really bad ass game or a new map or something dota yeah okay they own it fully or like big game hunters or something like that sure then they just oh this is great let's just put this into the circulation of tournament play and yeah we just own this now yeah winner mall Wars you just made one or more wars TD and for some reason it popped off bigger than bigger than dota Blizzard owns the entire thing now it seems very very pointed at dona I think they realize there's a game that ended up becoming there's a custom game that end up becoming a highly successful individual game we don't want that to happen again without us having control of it so let's just own everything on the platform that's bad enough take that a little bit further they went back to Warcraft 3 the original one and they changed that ah and this is where I agree they the same rules this is where if again I'm I'm fairly certain I'm right here but you should definitely look this up because we didn't have notes for this before the show and I'm just kind of spitballing off of things that I've heard but as far as I know they applied all the same rules and they killed B net on Warcraft 3 so you like have to play through work out three or four now oh I'm like glancing over the chat just in case someone corrects me but I think that's how that works but either way they they they sure pissed a lot of people off there's currently seven thousand seven hundred and twenty-nine ratings on Metacritic for user scores and it's at 0.7 overall one dude rated it a 10 and 75 out of 1,400 users rated it as helpful that rated it so like the opposite amount of those people rated it specifically as unhelpful oh God zero point seven can you give a score of zero know what I think yes I think you can someone gave a one all these people gave zeroes yeah what are they saying they're just like these short snappy ones this is sha dot dot slower like a snail there is also a ludes so so what that guys talking about is there's a lot of performance issues and a lot of people are having bike like . inability to play the game type of problems I really don't think that's the reason for how tanked the score is right that is not helping for sure but yeah I've seen I've seen I watched a video really quickly of one creator talking about all these issues and he brought up like Blizzard used to be known for further absolute polish and like things launching well like wall did they not really a lot of Blizzard launches have been really rocky but I think their appreciation for community looking at the the band stuff that we were just talking about looking at how they're treating modders with work f3 for some what kind of stuff is that an all-time low that's not good it was called a remaster I think Starcraft ok yeah okay there we go sure you some tech news we should do some techniques well before we get into the Huawei stuff what about the next folding phone yeah okay do you we I think you and I did talk with the galaxy fold yeah the big one lioness ended up loving it yes were you excited at all for that phone no because it was just purely too expensive yeah I was like 2,500 bucks what if just there was like a thousand bucks version a grand see that's like an iPhone yeah but I'm not a very good target for this what the heck I don't like this Google Docs you should change that um I'm not a very good target for this just because yeah I think I heard you got my screen there we go I don't know what this is supposed to be yeah but I I'm still running a pixel - okay and I'm happy with it and like in or not way too long I'm planning on just like swapping the battery out so it'll keep going nice I don't I don't game on my phone and everything else works perfectly fine mm-hmm so it's really that or pictures and the pictures are still good yep they're good enough yep this thing though is interesting because the thing the premise of the galaxy fold was that it's gonna be about the same size of normal phone in your pocket but then boom you basically have a tablet and you can do all this new productivity stuff but it's kind of like double thick yeah it's gonna be like it's a like a little bit bigger but but the thickness I don't think anyone's complaining about phone thickness for a while it was pretty fat it was probably thinner than this though yeah but it was also narrower it was like a candy bar but this device is kind of just like this but folds in half it folds in half I personally see no benefit to that what is the benefit to that because then you've just got something in your pocket that's double thick I think it's what about lady pockets man even my pockets I don't like putting this in my front pocket like like I'm not gonna ride a bike like that yeah I was like stabbing me yeah that might be better if that was just like that but chunky that's like what would you buy a whole phone specifically just for that but it's not just for that cause it's still a good phone and every other respect its if you're gonna buy it like is that is that gonna be the deciding feature for you to buy one phone over another phone you know it would be the sweet action of being like okay got it click boom like flip phones hanging up or answering hello I love that there's some loss of satisfaction there I used to have a slider phone and just being out that like the oh yeah yeah the the satisfaction of as I'm like pulling out of my pocket sliding it up together the call was so cool you ever had a fight on one of these phones no you take a hike mm can phillipe it down yeah there's something nice about the the cheap corded phone that you could throw across the room and like slam down on the receiver the other thing that's sick is when it's closed I can just confident put it my pocket with keys or something hmm because the screens are so sensitive yeah I'm so careful with all my phones I usually run naked maybe a skin like a deer and yeah no case yeah I like running naked redneck through the woods but even still and I'm so careful with the screen I never put it in the same pocket as anything sharp like keys it has its own dedicated pocket no coins there nothing I put it on the table always face up because I had a pass phone like get a scratch must have just been from sliding it and still after having it for like three weeks it does have a scratch in the top corner really why on the screen yes I don't get that that often I'm I'm how fairly careful I guess I don't I've never I don't put my phone in the same pocket as my keys I do wallet phone one pocket yes other pop yes as a rule screen protectors I usually do this one doesn't actually and I've had this one for a long time I just feel like they just add a little layer I don't want that on there you know yeah the only screen protectors I ever used long-term were tempered glass ones luckily those have gone down in price a lot I've even seen that really have I I had the one that you go in the mall kiosk and they like they put it on there and there's like in it there's like a video monitor that shows a drill head in the phone ghost armor that's what I had Ghost Armor coast armor yeah okay not familiar is it flexible well if my phone wasn't so how do I know well it's just wrong yeah so yeah this is a delete this is not an official announcement this phone is called the Galaxy Z or Zed and it's probably gonna come out pretty soon maybe it's early as a Valentine's Day at MWC or maybe at oh wait am i screwing this up I might be thinking of another release date and when I come out soon though we actually yeah that's right that's right we don't know if that to me pre-order or for sale and we don't know if it's gonna be a thousand bucks or 1500 bucks I would kind of bet it on it being 1500 honest you know they had like back in the era of slider and flip phones when those were King they had those kind of like square shaped phones that could flip out do you remember those I had a key bow that was a slider but when it slid it was like a horizontal keyboard okay but that was that was a rectangle yeah and you yeah are you talking about like the same dimensions as a Game Boy Advance SP yeah kind of yeah they had more square formatted ones I always thought those look super stupid and that's what this is to me what this looks like you know what that why they keep showing it at 90 degrees like that though is because it doesn't it's not a binary flip it's not closed and open you can actually Ratchet it it's continuous why would you do I don't know put it on the table like that okay maybe you could like makeup mirror yeah or maybe just like a video and you're like it's like its own kickstand you're eating your cereal and there's a little video playing okay but like in the in the era of so many people having those pops socket things on the back of their phones yeah you can use those as kickstands yeah I don't like them but like a lot of people a lot of people do by the way I think that we should have an Linus tech tip Spock saw sock puppet it seems like a pretty easy thing to do I think we should do it guys last he keeps ignoring me if you guys oh my god you so much do the chair when to tweet at Linus you should do the chin photo it shouldn't even be the LTTE logo should just be - chin photo in a circle on the back earphone I bet you'd sell a bunch of those that'd be great we haven't do something with that photo yes it's too sticky no good you guys should also do a shirt that's just super zoomed in of his face in that chin photo yeah she just needs a shirt it's like their background yeah is the color of the shirt yeah and it's just his head yeah perfect yeah that'd be great innovators okay that's it for that phone okay there's so many phone news there's a lot of talk about this huawei scandal all right let's do it yeah I'd be right about this yourself no you know so what happened was I guess the UK is trying to build out its 5k network infrastructure bungee sorry 5g no words and they were they had it's like a bid like there's lots of different companies to go with and they don't have anything domestic so they have to rely on a foreign company did you know this for them yeah and they the headlines are all you know despite US pressure UK allows Huawei to build out there 5g infrastructure and everyone's like bars so the UK government says it will allow telecom giant Huawei a limited role in building its new 5g data network they say that they're not gonna let them do any of the sensitive stuff so the UK's national cybersecurity Center which conducted a security and technical analysis for the government's 5g supply chain review says it considers Huawei a high risk vendor there's a list of these high risk vendors will always on that list but rather than banning the company from it's important new network the the center is asking British companies to use Huawei in a limited way so that it can collectively manage the risk now this agency of the NCSC formed a special qua way cybersecurity evaluation center ten years ago I think at that time members of the government we're just thinking using Huawei for their network infrastructure without like nobody knew any of the risks and they're just like yeah that seems like a good vendor and then someone else it was like wait hold on we need to create a whole agency to investigate these guys and they and and this agency also warns other countries that they should not include Huawei in their 5g network plans unless they have a really robust regulatory system and yet yet they they themselves they aren't doing our hiring qua way it's like how good are always prices serious but like oh yeah I don't know I it feels that that seems like a self dig to me what do you mean you shouldn't include them yeah I guess they're partially yeah I don't know they're like you shouldn't include them less you have a really robust regulatory system and then they're including them but only to a certain degree so I think they're just saying like oh okay I think they're saying that this is robust they say that they're not going to use them there's the two conditions they're not going to use them in there like core infrastructure they're like really high security stuff and they're not going to use them for greater than 35% of the network but all of this is problematic that's still so weird the sensitive core parts of the 5g and other high-speed networks so they're that agency's explanation is this they say that they weighed all the options but they blame a broken market for limiting their choices for large-scale 5g suppliers to just three Nokia Ericsson and Huawei and Huawei it's of course over the high-risk one in that environment the best strategy for the UK is not to become nationally dependent on any one supplier so they're going with all three suppliers and that's why Huawei is limited to just 35% it's like they're doing a third of it they're getting there and the other companies are doing each a third of it yeah well yeah so that's kind of like contrary to the headlines that you saw that like we're letting them do it it's kind of like we're letting everybody who bid on and do it we're trying to diversify to help save ourselves if like one or two of these companies end up being terrible yeah but there's some problems that there's this um article that we have listed here this of source number three it's from this Australian dude who used to be a member of the Australian signals Directorate and this is a group that tried to design a suite of cybersecurity tools that would give the Australian government confidence that a hostile intelligence service could not leverage their national vendors to gain access to 5g networks so they said this is a quote we asked ourselves if we had powers akin to the 2017 Chinese intelligence law that's that law where the Chinese government like has to have access to whatever data from any company like oh yeah okay yeah so that's called the 2017 Chinese intelligence law if they're saying if we had that law to direct your company which supplies 5g equipment to telco networks what could we do with that power and could anyone stop us and we concluded that we could be awesome that No and if they did we could plausibly deny our activities safe and the knowledge that it would be too late to reverse billions of dollars worth of investment and ironically our targets would be paying to build a platform for our own signals intelligence and offensive cyber operations yeah it's like if that's their goal yeah but like in hallways defense the CEO is like I would rather shut this company down then create a backdoor for the Communist Party to exploit that's that's the statement but it's like the counter that is like we don't believe you yeah you have to say and like maybe how involved in actually like doing that kind of stuff is he like the Chinese have people as part of the company that is setting this up completely under him without him having any control or mind of it at all mm-hmm like how does he no one really a gigantic company yeah we're a really interesting point that this this person makes is that the this defense that we've seen all the articles is that they're only gonna be involved in a limited way they're not gonna be involved in the in the core stuff but you know I know very little about 5g but this guy's saying that the idea of core versus edge that is the paradigm per for G does not apply to 5g in 5g if you want the benefits of 5g it's more of a distributed system rather than centralized and so you need to be able to handle sensitive data at the edge really close to the clients so there's just no way to have a protected core it's it's all out there so when you say that hallways only going to do 35% well it's like which 35 that's it's all vulnerable it's all important hopefully not your neighborhood yeah who knows that's weird I don't know this whole situation is very odd I'm kind of surprised the US didn't jump in more just because of how aggressive they've been about other countries using Huawei 5g like I'm kind of surprised even though it doesn't make a ton of sense I'm kind of surprised the u.s. wasn't like we'll help subsidize this when we use them well cuz they've been very Agri about it globally yeah well at first they jumped in and were like hold on what do I have it here US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the US will help UK reduce risks associated with involving Huawei in its 5g network that's a latest that's the update before that you previously suggest that that hallways equipment posts a spying risk saying that we won't be able to share information with nations that put that into their critical information systems it's like we're not gonna play with you UK if you do this Wow but I guess they be nagged on that and now they're just gonna try to help mitigate the risks which yeah interests which increases the cost because if a lot of this is like hey while we has really good technology and it's a pretty good price then it's like well what are you factoring into that price notwithstanding the price of secure data which is priceless you still have to invest in all these mitigating features yeah interesting okay well sponsor time pulse wave pulse yeah anyways those are super cool if you're into that and we're into movies word LTT store.com first often as we say LT Kishore calm it's actually really hard to say Ltd store.com ltg's faragon of the do store.com why is it hard to say the TT stop that yeah that is that TTS soon did you saw eg story I haven't seen this yet anyways ten million I was gonna take what no I haven't seen the website oh the photos yeah okay ten million t-shirt limited-edition I believe they are pre-orders the shirt as it says on the screen is going to be gone forever at 11:59 p.m. Pacific February second prime is a nurse it is limited its limit edition and a limited quantity because they're only able to get a certain amount of the black shirts they need to print the logo on that's this weekend guys yeah so if you want one and these are really cool they are cool they have this like speckle I don't even know if you you can't tell in that image you can't tell me I don't think that image has it they have these speckles in here and it makes it kind of look ahead like as a patina we like weathered yeah it looks like I'm wearing like a sweet like Vancouver Grizzlies basketball team shirt from the 2000s yeah I don't think these characters you never get to see marks on their given where is he gonna put that you know he went right after the photo yeah there's probably a photo with that and they decided no down the cutting room floor there's a bunch of other cool stuff to the SPC shirt the Ltd hats they have t-shirts sweaters hats water bottles I don't know if they tell the self is a strap to anymore hoodies constellation shirts that's one of my favorite shirts ever underwear their other works great it's it's my favorite underwear that I own I'm not not just saying that the lanyards very high quality tech late can support them I think we need a I love the lanyard by the way everyone buy one if you have the type of partner like my wife who she doesn't put stuff in a spot when I get home I put my keys in the dish you know they're always in the day by the door she doesn't have any kind of reason like that first for things belonging places so I got the bright orange lanyard and I put that on her keys it's so high vis I can find it so quickly yes that's actually that's that's pretty clever she doesn't like it okay yeah I was going to say you need a carpool critics thing like merch yeah maybe one day man like for emails yeah I don't I don't show I don't necessarily mean now but like yeah sometimes I don't know what it would necessarily be I don't know we have there's like some imagery if you watch on Flo playing there's like a little bus that goes blind yeah no but I don't know what item song yeah I know you guys have like your keys I don't know and you know like your your tape and stuff yeah how's that yeah you guys have some some logos we got like three emails since this we call that other being the show what does that mean like people have been emailing in but talking about how much they like the podcast and stuff and one person who ate is a girl and B is a floatplane subscriber was like trying to give us money uh-huh Candace you don't need to give us money well they already are just don't skip the whole thing yeah exactly okay so I guess we can yeah I want to talk about an airdrop but for Android Oh so weird that it took so long for air airdrop to hit Android so for those of you don't use an iPhone like me the air doll okay so not actually airdrop but it's it's analogous to airdrop it's the same yeah same tech yeah so but I thought you meant like exactly the same thing because there's some apple the Apple stuff that's only gonna work if it's actually airdrop like what as far as I know I don't actually have examples well this is gonna be airdrop is still Apple Apple and then this which is gonna be called nearby sharing or Android Beam Vasher know it and your beans gone oh yeah yeah it's called nearby share or something like that and it's just gonna be Android to a nearby sharing that's way less cool of a name airdrop is so cool oh yeah you're by sharing anybody Sharon's not a sucks it sounds like the category name yeah beam was weight like it sounds like Android Beam and airdrop are nearby sharing services the kind of are so Android Beam was NFC so yeah put your phone's close together tap them that hold there that made the handshake and then I don't believe it actually sent by NFC cuz that's really slow yeah NFC is like what you used to tap your credit card to pay for stuff more authentication maybe if you're in Canada so that did the handshake and then after that I believe it was Wi-Fi or Bluetooth but the way airdrop works is it uses bluetooth to do the handshake and then after that it sends over Wi-Fi now not over like a Wi-Fi network like your home network it just uses your Wi-Fi antenna so you guys don't you don't need to be on the same Wi-Fi so that is coming to Android there was an announcement like a couple weeks ago where Chinese brands were doing that for Chinese phones like okay pop oh and Xiaomi we're doing it be VK group phones and that's probably still gonna be the case in China because this Android version is going to be available wherever you have Google Play services so that's outside of China but it's gonna be sick but here's something I don't understand I have a question for you because it says that you can it'll be over Wi-Fi unless that sucks and then it can do like a blue tooth fallback for like really small files but there's also a setting where you can specify that you wanted only to transfer over LTE well how do you want to do that like if the other phone doesn't have a Wi-Fi antenna only over is kind of a weird option maybe like a temporary allow or something that would be cool cuz if you just don't have Wi-Fi or something and Bluetooth but you don't you just need a Wi-Fi antenna don't you like I can be in the middle of woods I can oh so you could make a spot yeah yeah that's pretty odd but wait do you need a hotspot if you had Wi-Fi one of them would have to receive what I would have to send they can absolutely do that it's not an issue I thought device is just like you can be in the middle of the woods you don't need to make a high spot hotspot and because you have a Wi-Fi antenna and I have a Wi-Fi antenna it like goes no my dad believes so does the neat one would have to be accepting connection from the other one yeah but like does it create a little LAN or something but this is this is a new I don't know how they set it up yeah place a new implementation yeah I'm not sure okay I just don't know why you'd want to use this LTE thing like oh yeah send those over my data for some reason at that point you can just like send it via Instagram DM or some other form of file sharing but apparently this would be faster than a lot of those someone in the chat said it's more secure that's interesting I know with airdrop that it's encrypted mmm are they talking about airdrop correct Wi-Fi direct doesn't need a router yeah ad hoc network yeah okay okay okay Hawk baby good call good call nice one question is is this gonna be released at the MWC or is it gonna release a Google i/o nobody knows is it gonna be a pixel only feature at first that I doubt because it's not like a kind of thing that sells phones this is only useful if everyone else has it so the probably just gonna push you to everybody yeah like I mean kind of if I was like oh you have a pic so oh sweet I can send it this way that's awesome you should gonna pixel I I don't I would never really use this okay would you are you actually gonna use it there's only been like probably five times in my life where I'm like even like you're a hole and that's what I mean yeah where I'm like oh I'll just send a Hugh by bluetooth or something it's usually when I'm at like I never even be at a ski resort and they're just the Wi-Fi is crap like I can't just text it to you or make out or email it to you like there's no service yeah I guess so but I think in most of those scenarios very rarely in one of those scenarios to be fair well if you're traveling have you ever been traveling and there's like what there's Wi-Fi at the hostel but everyone's on it and it's just so slow like not only are you in a developing country but like 50 people are trying to use it the thing I need to share a file well you're like oh yeah we went there yesterday like here's my pictures or something or like we're chopping together and I want to send them from my phone so and I know this is a specific scenario you just gave me and I'm going after it but whatever usually they were just being Google photos and I'll just send them the link to my google photos and that's not transferring the files because it's in Google cloud anyways oh so you just send me a link then yeah and you can send that easily for Google's photos person yeah I guess I don't know I just feel like I have already solved this issue by using tools in other ways so I don't know it's cool I'm happy it exists I am certain some people use it I know airdrop is very useful for like my mom my mom works in the in the movie industry and they like to be able to quickly share things that way and they like have requirements on some shows that you have to have like devices that can use airdrop without any third party like yeah so you can peer-to-peer because they they use it so actively so having an Android competitor in that space is great I'm just personally I just don't see myself using it or at least very often maybe they just um they're just doing it now just so they have an answer for every iPhone thing there is yeah but iPhones have airdrop and you're like now we have this they're trying to answer iMessage with RC s because the begs question why now why not like ten years ago yeah I have no idea it's I'm happy they did it eventually but yeah I think I think the if this came out ten years ago I would probably use it now more often but because it didn't come out yeah yeah now I'm just so I'm Maureen thirty I'm just gonna christen lives I'm not sure I wish yeah but like but I feel like I've found reasonable solutions to these problems to the point where I'm probably not really gonna use it there might be the on scenario where I'm like oh hey yeah okay well I know this tool that can solve our problem there are settings in here where you can make like visibility settings where you can make your device always visible to your contacts or certain contacts or you can make it like ask every time I want you to make your as public to me okay and so from my like seat I can just like send you I can airdrop you stuff all the time from my desk but then like okay that's great and I'm totally down but why not just use a traditional messaging system because I want to do this that's my boy it's like it just it doesn't seem to like where we're at the point where there's so many other solutions it's this faster it is faster I give you seven video instant messaging oh yeah yeah but that's if you like downloaded that video alright took the video on my phone yeah yeah you're gonna send me our log videos awesome yeah what's that video gonna be yeah remains to be seen but not for your eyes stream audience remember Eve yes this crowd funding company yeah no they're a hardware company they had a crowd a little bit tell me what you were and then they're it's these guys were kind of a blip to me I didn't jump on it it sounded very weird but I was excited to see where it went and then it kind of took forever and weird stuff happened around it so I stopped Carrie I think that's about it it was like in 2017 they basically made like a Microsoft Surface pro yeah there's an all-in-one things right copycat to that but it's just significantly cheaper and had some improvements ahead USBC yeah it was a crowd developed crowd funded Windows two-in-one but then they were terrible at getting it out to backers because I mean it's a crowdfunding thing and that happens basically every time what they've done now is they've announced a kick-ass monitor a really cool monitor so they ditched the two in one idea I just went monitor which i think is cool well I read an article from February of 2019 it was in the aftermath of you know that people were really interested in the two and one they made but then there had such a backlog that it was like you gave them some money for the product and you didn't get it for nine months or maybe even over a year then they finally fulfilled all the orders I think people got their stuff now some people got stuff when it was like great this 2017 era CPU is not so cool plus I probably had to buy another laptop in the interim I was waiting so long but as far as I know everyone their stuff and many people who got the stuff loved this stuff when that was done they then were like talking to their backers about what should we do next they just taking ideas and I guess this must have been one of the ideas that's like just a sense I again it's it's like not that far of a departure but it's something that's quite cool and potentially even the people that were already using their stuff like if you already have the two in one you could still benefit from a monitor yeah sure if you have like your most valuable customers if you do another laptop they're just like well okay well I guess I could get an upgrade maybe take two years to ship it to me again then who knows but yeah like I like that I like that the current customers could still integrate it into their setup and I like that it's probably a little easier to do so let's talk about how BA these monitors are they sound pretty sweet so they're 27 inch IPS panels I believe made by LG they have one millisecond response times they have 98% covers the DCI p3 color space which and 10-bit color depth and that's all very cool but here's what really matters a qHD display so 1440p 240 Hertz I don't think that exists and as a mass-market product okay yeah it's pretty it's pretty sick and then like that's that's HDR 600 q HD 240 Hertz $509 yeah that's super competitive the monitors once you start getting into like wicked high performance price up very very quickly 4k at 144 hurts again display HDR 600 for $609 and q HD at 144 Hertz for three hundred $69 I'm double-checking that right now cuz I thought I read that the $369 one was 1080p 240 or something I thought it was 240 oh wait I should just follow the link to the forum one the one thing while he's looking that up is they have some crazy ports on these monitors they have two USB C ports three USB it just says a that's normal 1 - d/p 1.4 and 1 hdmi 2.0 a and a 3.5 millimeter jack no I was wrong even on the form it says it's a 1440p monitor at 144 hurts for 369 now that 369 is the early bird price that would be a sweet price but as I think it's gonna be like at least 10 percent higher than that well apparently it's already gone up it was 349 and it's display HDR 400 yeah nobody goes near that down yeah it's still great the question is though should anyone trust them again I mean because I would be concerned I would if I backed this and wanted this monitor I would make sure that I'm already happy with the setup I currently have you know it'll be in limbo yeah and this would be like a nice addition to it and I'm not worried about when it shows if you back and it's refundable it is forever I don't know like this like the test the truck like the cyber truck yeah because if you read this story like what the CEO says he's like we've made every mistake there is to make you know they got a lot of experience from being one of the notoriously hated are you going to again like who knows they said that what have they working with the same distributors so they got new they got an a distributor and they said what happened before was they had a flash sale which generated a ton of orders those orders flagged their payment processor and so the payment processor froze everything so they couldn't fulfill all the orders and they had warned the processor that they were gonna have big numbers but I guess the processor didn't take them seriously I can sympathize with that working with payment processors has been horrible terrible experience they make so much money and they just don't care about you at all yeah yeah it's not great so we I mean we haven't been frozen but I've heard of many many people who have had that issue and you're kind of screwed so it could happen again though yeah frozen to the waiting for that oof yes yeah so I don't know I would I would have concerns but we're gonna get it we're gonna review it with that sure new video coming out 2022 but like honor no longer new channel I think I think that would be be the thing it's like I would look into it more make sure they had 100% deliverables make sure they actually got everything out if they did I would make sure that my set up does not rely on this monitor and then if I wanted to go for it seems like the price is really good it sounds like it'll be very nice a really baller monitor should we do some super cats yeah let's do it Chad you know what we need on this show is a sound board I love other shows that have like h3 has that they have a sound board he can go he can press the button go super chest tube dress that'd be so fun we had for like one or two shows we had a mixer that had like a swear button it was kind of cool what like it would bleep out your sweaters so if you want to swear you hold the button down swear then let it back up that's so fun yeah mega do do you ever mind I don't know how to do this I don't know where they are oh can you just scroll through the chat do your activity oh it's a viewer activity why is it viewer activity why they just call it chat okay any gooders in there there's not very many in general I think it's cuz we haven't been reading them very much they don't like us yeah all right well machine is here there's a formula to get the right cutting speed such rpm for the material slash and mill sizes on a mill I can what how is this related did we talk about anything related to that get the info from the guy anyway you know knowledge is power I'll take it none of this makes sense to me based on what we were talking about I feel like this is from a different stream one super chat just says we want Apple another one just says big oof yeah greetings from Spain my boys Cheers greenish tu amigo hey guys if a viewer skips an integrated sponsor spot or uses a browser extension like sponsor block never heard of that be hurting a channel just as much as adblock or is it impossible for a sponsor to no I think that it's possible for us to know when we look at YouTube analytics is yeah see a graph of when people stop viewing and how they taper off and sometimes you'll see a spike and that means that people repeat they watched it twice they thought that joke or something so funny they'll go back again and so you could see the viewers are here like hundred percent of the audience starts at the beginning and then you get to the ad and then it drops off a bunch and then it might pick back up after the ad so we can see that it's whether or not a youtuber exposes that to the sponsors that they work with and that would probably be inconsistent but unlikely probably they're not yeah they're not sharing that yeah so you're probably good but that could vary depending on the channel that you're following - isn't here to say no how about some straight-up flow plain merch not this LTT slash full plain synergy nonsense Wow I'm sensical I don't the the last the the Ltd sucks for plain shirts actually apparently sold decently well I don't remember I think well I don't know if it was decently well or if it just exceeded expectations because those are technically different things but may I mean maybe sometime I'm I find I love the idea of ltte merch and I love or sorry my deal open merch but floatplane merch and I love seeing it on people but I'm also surprised that anyone cares oh come on there's that James SC hosting there's a string hanging off your left sleeve no I know gone now you know you guys should have four floatplane merch is bomber jackets you know there's like pilot bombers oh my god like those leather jackets that would be sick they're $500 they come with aviators in the pocket the aviators have a tag floating off you can't remove it it says full clean the logo now you guys so super chats a lot of these are very general so I'm just skipping over them one says look at this plate that was actually pretty funny I like that a lot what is Wayne vodka mean to floatplane that's a feature that we will have it's not the highest current priority feature but it is a feature that we will have eventually which is more Canadian quarter gas or Letterkenny well I haven't watched Letterkenny very much corner gas is very good very Canadian I can't speak to that I feel like corner gas is probably slightly more realistic okay but Letterkenny is more entertaining not unrealistic caricatures I guess because they're everyone's very extreme in that show okay like you look at a Stewart okay you ever watch Larry Kane oh and a friend is close friends with one of the guys I'm like oh I had dinner with him once I'm like oh you're on a show cool bad like these girls came up and like suddenly were like he was taking picture of these strangers and I was like what's going on with that and he's like oh he's you don't let her Kenny you know like okay I had no idea so if you're a fan I'm sorry you should be I should have got us there are national heroes he's a nice guy basically great smile do you remember okay hold on this this is important content are you trying to find out which one yeah I don't know if I want to say do i yeah sure who cares this is only for was the blonde guy with like big curly hair maybe this is good oh yeah he's awesome yeah from I mean they're all surprising but yeah that's really committed all the problems anyways they're both great they're both unrealistic but in different ways but they're both very Canadian awesome at heart I don't want to pick one and I want it moving on where's Linus I don't know weird you didn't Miami that's party in the city where the heat is on can we just end on a Will Smith reference yes sing us out all night on the beach the break of dawn welcome to
