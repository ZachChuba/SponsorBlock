back in the day I did a degree in psychology and one of the things that they drummed into us while I was studying is if you want to be a good psychologist or a good therapist you also have to be in regular therapy yourself and I think that rule applies for photographers as well as portrait photographers especially I think it's really really helpful if we go and have our portraits taken by another photographer I actually said as much in a video I did a couple of years ago and the reason for that is it gives us empathy for me the greatest portrait photographers are those who have a healthy awareness of their subject and their fears and their insecurities in the moment and an understanding of how people work and think because if you're the kind of person who wants to capture authentic portraits of people capture real moments of people find their real humanity and capture that on the sensor I think it's essential to have that kind of empathy for how someone is feeling and who they really are in the moment I think subjects who leave the studios of great portrait photographers can often have an enlightening experience that they're better able to see how the rest of the world really sees them that they're able to shift some of those ideas they have about themselves that just aren't true and in that whole mix they walk back into the world where their confidence level raised way up and being that kind of photographer really comes down to less about the gear we use or the lighting we use and more about how we work with people and that's why going to another photographer and letting them take our picture being on the other side of the lens feeling the discomfort and understanding what it's like and how vulnerable it is to sit there is essential to being able to have the empathy to coach somebody else towards a great portrait so today I'm off to have my portrait taken [Music] [Applause] [Music] if I'm going to be honest I feel nervous I think because photography is the thing I do it's difficult to let go of control on the one side because you know usually I've got Cameron Han I'm choosing lighting and I'm in control but if I'm going to another photographer and and I am and it's someone I know who is great at what he does and I can trust him but still kind of letting go that control putting it someone else's hands trusting they're going to do the best to treat you well in that situation and shoot you in a way that doesn't embarrass you he's kind of a giving up of control and the other thing and probably this is more what I feel nervous about is I feel very self-conscious I feel very aware of my Falls in particular and they've been running through my mind woahh I've been sitting on the train specifically obviously like my face I've always had bad skin I mean since I was a teenager I was diagnosed with an excess of testosterone and that just meant that I had to deal with bad skin my whole life and even when my skin isn't that bad because I'm having a good month it still means my skin is very scarred and day to day I don't even really think about that it's not that important to me I've come to terms with it and it's okay but sitting in front of a good camera a good sense or a good lens under good lighting and knowing that my face is gonna fill a frame is making me feel very self-conscious and I think I have to remember that that's how people feel when they come to my studio and they're walking through the door that's what they're thinking like every floor they have are right on the front of their brain it's highlighted they're worried about it and and me being compassionate towards that and understanding I think he's gonna help them feel better and help me get a better shot as they loosen up I mean to be honest I was coming down here thinking can I check it out why am I actually doing this it is a very uncomfortable thing but I'm here now so let's do it so in the car on the way of the studio and let me introduce you because he's the man at the moment this is Tommy Reynolds hey everyone Tommy has an amazing well first of all let me show you Tommy doesn't mess around this is boots that's that's Tommy's gear in his boots so it really isn't messing around but we're really looking forward to this you have to check Tommy's channel out I'm gonna put a link down below definitely take a look Tommy is great at digging in on some of the technical side of portrait photography specifically so if you are wanting to get this as studio lighting and all that kind of stuff and and shooting portraits specifically Tommy's a bit of a ninja so it's definitely definitely check him out he has way too few followers for the quality of his channel so definitely take a look and we're just on our way of the studio thanks man you driving very well thank you I'm so conscious now I tends to tends to [Music] I get doing a cheer your setup and of what you're thinking what you're going to do yet so for the first set up I've got a couple of gravity backups here which I've kind of put it to this kind of lead shape just to give it a little bit more depth rather than just having one single one so foot one actually coming towards me here with this setup here so that's as far as the background goes we've got two mid grey gravity backdrops for my mainline I've got over 150 centimeter easy-open softbox here nice big light and nice soft light I really like it it's kind of my go-to when I'm in controlled environments like this for the backlight I've got you too  this is a 55 centimeter beauty dish with a grid on and inside of it I've actually got a magmod gel I've got a CTO gel half CTO it's my openness up we look here so that there this little gel here so this is really cool just to add a bit of separation to the background and also add color as well so not only in thought of separation from light but almost have got a tiny bit of color there with a half CTO gel in there as well it just pops in like that and I just pop these two bits in and that's my backlight and then for the last for the last bit fulfilled I'm using this green light so this is my go-to this is mr. Phil as I like to call it this is the thing that I use all the time and it just creates that nice painterly quality to the images it's like if I've got shadow on this side then this just kind of lifts up the shadows a little bit more which gives me a little bit more of a wiggle room in Lightroom if I want to lift that shoulder up because I've I've punched a bit of detail into that shadowy side if that makes sense so that's as far as we go at the moment for this setup we're going to do a couple of other setups through the for the next couple of hours but this is going to be the first one [Music] well that was amazing and super uncomfortable but like it was so I openly being on the the wrong side of the lens like because I just don't do it enough and and and I have to say like you are a total pro like I'm not I mean obviously you're a pro in lighting and the photography I mean looking at your channel in your work it's obvious you know how to take photographs but what really struck me was how you are very good at communicating and making me feel marginally less uncomfortable are you brilliant at timing stuff and moving things on and feeling when it's getting tiring for the person sitting there like you obviously got a very very good system if empathy fits in with your photography what we're all is it no it definitely does I think it's it's hugely important in terms of trying to get them to feel comfortable in front of you for me what I define with empathy is vulnerability I think vulnerability and empathy is hugely related and the way in which I try and make my subjects feel comfortable is opening up myself there's an example I was photographing the guy who was a he was going through a tough time with his confidence and I opened up and said I'm actually going through something similar and I opened up about my confidence issues and sometimes I have anxiety about things and I don't really kind of talk about it much online and it I could see him just look relieved at the fact that he wasn't alone and the fact that this person that was taking the photograph felt a similar way and I felt like that's how I had not only gained the respect of my clients but also just in general I think in general as humans if you open up and be a bit more vulnerable I think and showing which helps them to relate to relax and and be willing for the shoot I think so vulnerability for me is the link to empathy for me so I was saying before I came here that I'm quite aware of my skin but like it's you know it's been scarred from bears again over the years and and that's what was going through my head walking in the room and it's not something I think of in the day to day if you've got someone walking in who's got body image issues or doesn't feel they're attractive in some particular way but they they know they need a portrait how do you kind of deal with somebody's very specific insecurities it's a really good question and I think when if they can give me maybe like a mood or sometimes I'll encourage them to give me a mood board of images that they like and then I can kind of get an idea of what kind of lighting they might like what kind of posing or what kind of I can get a vibe then before they walk into my shoot if they're someone who's particularly self-conscious and again I think it comes back to my tethering process which helps and aids that the last thing I want to do is then to leave the studio and then they get the images and saying oh I didn't like that angle and if it was just a case of that angle just changing that to make them a little bit better about a particular thing that they're uncomfortable with then I'm going to feel gutted I think a lot of it just feeds off their reaction I think you the more you just work with people the more you just subconsciously train that muscle without even realising so yeah it's definitely a collaborative process and I kind of just feed off their energy if they're liking it or not so I felt like you were enjoying the first setup probably more than maybe the last setup and I personally enjoyed the first setup more I think everything was just working better in terms of the terms there everything the light and positioning and stuff so I hung on the first position probably more so than the others but I think that for good reason so the second setup I wasn't as comfortable with and we moved on quite quickly so yeah that's why it's always collaborative so I've had people walk into a studio with me and just go I just want you to know like I really don't like photographs so you don't really have something specific to lead them away from it's just general insecurity do you have like tricks on a shoot you use to kind of I've experienced some of them today so I know you do but you have tricks you use to kind of break people's insecurities down and make them settle yeah I think you know what I'm about to say yeah it was something that we did at the end so yeah I'll and I'll do it at weddings as well because as a wedding photographer as well you're 99% they're dealing with people that are not professional models they're just normal people you know they're all gonna be the same they're all gonna say the same thing they were going to be very much yeah I don't like my favor being taken okay so I mean there's a wedding photography you can be like the whole candid off the cuff but when it's a portrait that it's that we're different however even when it's a portrait wedding portrait or if it's a actual portrait like in this environment I'll do a thing that I adopted from a photographer called Victoria Wall who likes to do a thing called the photobooth technique and within that photo booth technique that we did at the end where I asked them to pretend they're in a photo booth at a wedding and I only get those five shots to give me some ik totally random every time and it just they forget about the camera in that moment and it's actually probably the moments after those five shots where they laugher themselves at how ridiculous it is and then that's it so I really I don't really care about the five shots yeah I want the shots that proceed immediately after that like where they just loosen up and then they just relax and crack a smile and then once they smiled I'll say right now right here right here right look at me look at me look at me because they're in that they're in that hi they're up here still before they slowly come back down and while they're up here they're looking at my camera and I'm getting the shot so that's one way I I that's one thing I like to do to kind of break that kind of awkwardness so people starting out as portrait photographers like from scratch they've done the work and they've learnt you know how to use a camera and settings and they found light setups they're like now they have to start learning about how to deal with people what's your kind of little nuggets of advice like these are things to pay attention to or work on and develop I think as I said before I think it's it's like a muscle it's think of it like a muscle and the more you do it the more you will get better it's like when you're learning to drive when you're learning to drive you're consciously aware of the gearstick you might forget what gear are mine you need to look down and change that right there is you thinking about your lights too much because you haven't quite learned the lighting yet but once you've learnt the lighting once you've learnt the gearstick then the real kind of journey begins of it will becomes effortless once this all becomes effortless then you can slowly concentrate on talking to your subject and just the more you do it the more it will get better and better start obviously with friends and start maybe with the photobooth technique that I mentioned which is always a good way of loosening people up and but I think it's just shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot the more you do it the more you will get better I promise I think if you're an extrovert person then again I think it's still the same even if you're an introvert you'll just have your own way of talking to them maybe I'm a bit louder than than other people I like when I like when when I like something I think the subject knows when I like but yes I think even as an introvert it's just a muscle keep doing it you will get better because if you if you are in that camp where you know your settings now then just once you're dialed in you've done your test shots the lights not going to change its stop worrying about it stop worrying about what this lights doing if it's the right power because now you can just talk to them just talk to them about their day what they're doing later and use their name always say their names that this this is really great Sean I really like if you turn your head this way okay hold that that looks great if you keep talking to them then they're gonna feel more comfortable because if you stop talking it's straightaway when a model will start to ask themselves why is he stop talking they am i doing something wrong it is you not enjoying it so even if it's not going great then just say okay it just I would just lie a little bit and say yet this is really good if you turn this way if you keep talking to them not necessarily about how it's going but just maybe about their day to give you some breathing room so if I'm sitting lights out pulsate so you know what you're doing later and as I'm doing that I'm actually just moving the light around so there's not comfortable silence and playing music in the background as well ask them what they want to listen to what they enjoy listening to and put that on now help flow this year as well it's been amazing thanks so much thank you do thank you [Music] as uncomfortable and experiences that was it was also a really good experience it was such a pleasure to be in the room with a pro who's working with you I mean Tommy really knows his stuff he knows his lighting he knows his camera gear he doesn't have to think about it and he really just takes his time to focus on you as an individual and chew it where you're at and how to get you towards a good shot and I learned a lot just being with him for the day I said at the beginning of this video I studied psychology and a lot of me was very disappointed that I I didn't think about studying photography at the time and used that training period of my life to really dig in with photography skills but I'm actually very grateful now because there is so much our portrait photography that I think comes down to psychology I did corporate headshots with a company recently and shot through about 15 people in an afternoon and it seemed to all go well I went home and I edited up the selections that they've made and sent the images through and I got an email back saying everyone's very happy with their images but the one lady is very very concerned and she's asking why did you squash her head in Photoshop I obviously hadn't squashed a head in Photoshop but she was convinced that that's what I'd done and she wasn't sure why I'd done that I sent her a video that shows my process and show that I don't change shapes of face or anything like that but she just wouldn't believe me so I said okay I'm gonna come back next time something's obviously gone wrong for you and I haven't done anything different to your image than the rest but let's take your image again and see how it goes so I went back the next month to shoot a new round of headshots and I included her in that round I took the images home and I edited them up again and sent them through and I got the email back saying everyone's very very happy with this image but this lady wants to talk to you again and she said to me I'm very very upset I don't understand why you're squashing my head in Photoshop and obviously wasn't doing it so I got on the phone with her and I said listen this image is a good representation of what you look like I understand that it's not what you think you look like but this is who you are and for my money let me say I think you look absolutely great I'm not being kind to you I'm telling you honestly I think you look great other people in the office of saying they think it's a good image of you too and I think you need to do some thinking about what you actually look like because there's we see some work to be done and I'm not your psychologist but I think it'd be a good thing to go and sit and talk to a therapist about it because there's something to work through here that I promise you if you deal with it will make you feel much better about yourself day to day I've had people question my photography skills in the room saying I don't like how I look in this image you're shooting me wrong I mean I shoot everybody the same I have a style it's what I do if you come to me you can be pretty sure of what you're going to get but especially in the era of cell phone images and selfies where the trick is to hold the phone high so that you get a a high angle and that apparently makes you look better to some people I don't think it looks great but a lot of people think that's the way that I look great and that's how they train themselves to see themselves so when you shoot them straight on under good lighting it's a very uncomfortable situation for them and it's portrait photographers you have to be aware they are not going to have the self-awareness to understand why they don't look the way they usually do and they're gonna blame your skills as a photographer and don't take that personally that's literally just them struggling with what they look like and maybe not having an accurate image of what they look like and who they really are I'd also say that if you're going to get your portrait taken and I'm talking to subjects now it's important that you choose a photographer you can trust so look through their portfolio see the work that they do and choose someone whose style you like there's no point in going to a photographer and then trying to bully them into taking the shot you want the way you want it because you might not really know what you're doing you have to trust their skill and their competence and their kindness and their humanity and drawing the best image out of you they can and then to portrait photographers you have a great deal of power in the room and it's very easy to get high on that power I mean we have a mysterious skillset that most people don't really know how it works and we know we have the ability to make them look any way that we want to but if we abuse that power if we act like some kind of you know heroes celebrity artist in the room and we're not considering and concerned about our subjects feelings we're just abusing the position that we have for me the best portrait photographers happily give up that power to collaborate they want to sit with the subject hear how they're feeling hear what their insecurities are and work with them around those insecurities and help to draw out the best of their humanity and make them shine so they can walk out the door of your studio on the day feeling much much better about themselves and that kind of work takes empathy thanks again to Squarespace for go to Squarespace com forward slash
