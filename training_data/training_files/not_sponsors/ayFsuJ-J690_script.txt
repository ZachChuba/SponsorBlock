have emotes and stuff like that what is that is that from your chat that's my chat how did you make this how long did it take you i was born this way what do you mean so you're like lady gaga what oh i i get it okay great sometimes this is the hallway that's a vending machine nice cool nice and then this is another vending machine [ __ ] god damn it why are there so many bugs today okay normally this does not happen and okay currently i'm i'm stuck lucky guy sorry sorry about that i feel like you have a lot of friends you're pretty cool is that sarcasm no i think you're you're very unique uh and uh i think you have a good thing going for you and i think you could use you should have friends you do have friends we talk about okay you're i feel like you're a little bit too pg but overall i think you are waiting with what you're wearing yeah of course i feel like you fit in the offline tv just fine is that sarcasm was this whole thing sarcasm are you why do you just repeat everything i'm saying i said unfriend do you really want to talk about this yes do we have to yes okay i unfriended you because you said that you don't i'll find out right now i said mikko and you said hope you had a good christmas and i told you to go and then i said [ __ ] and i said here i'll help so i unfriended you so that way you stopped talking to me how does that make any sense we were talking too much and we were having fun and we i wanted to save it for this stream so i said okay instead of trying to talk to you right there and then i'll unfriend you until the show so that way you stop talking to me oh what is your favorite thing to do besides streaming all right last night i had a dream and this dream was literally i woke up i was in mr beast's arms and i went over to my computer and there were two bounties and i got really excited so that is what i yeah i usually just live eat [ __ ] stream that's all i do i just stream stream stream i think about streaming 24 7. it's my entire life wow how do you juggle your relationship with maya then well i added my relationship to my stream so that way if i hang out with her it's technically usually on stream so i don't have to worry about it [Music] just like i know how you juggle your relationship is that guy who with the box who you just went in this crotch i know that was your boyfriend okay no that was a random person in chat no that's i can see your boyfriend's running around right now he's about to take the phone boyfriend the keys are just random people in chat okay they can just spawn in my world randomly and just streak around do you like streaming yeah i do i do really like streaming does it seem like i don't no it seems like you do you i feel like you have the perfect vibe for streaming you're really you got like that like adhd mentality you just don't shut the hell up uh you constantly keep asking questions which is really good ah okay you're a girl oh okay that's not that's that's not an advantage there's a few like there's a few things i'm developing there's quite a few things actually there's one that's like family feud style there's another one where you guys are little robots with like screens on your heads and then you guys can fight each other in my game world like celebrity death match is tommy in it gonna be on it why do you want to fight him no i just want to be next to him that may be pretty cool he's 16 i know that's why i don't want to fight him i just think he'd be really cool aren't you like 25 aren't you like 32 like shut the [ __ ] up i'm 22 okay you are not okay i don't i don't care hey i'm 22 technician is 30. she's not even starting one yet how could she be 32 [Music] you realize 30 on twitch it's like you're dead dr disrespect is 38. and look where he is oh [ __ ] you're right see now i really want to be your friend because i want to invest in you because i know you're going to be even bigger when you're older when you're like 31. so what should i do next i think honestly if i with the route you're going i think the best thing you could do is make an rpg but i don't know if you're down to do something like that well i'm already making one no that's perfect yeah then i think you should make an rpg i think that'd be really cool okay yeah but that's not gonna last that long you know that's gonna be like a couple special events and then it's done you wanna pitch streamer you wanna make streamers hate each other no not actually hate each other but like a celebrity deathmatch type of thing you know where you can you control your own character and they control their theater and chat controls them at the same time and you guys can fight each other in the game world what's your goal in this whole twitch world uh entertain people run my show entertain people uh entertain people you want money i want to entertain people i want to make stuff cool stuff innovative stuff and i'll be a creative streamer like for example i feel legit [ __ ] myself what did you listen to anything i said or why are you getting distracted by things on the wall did you listen to anything you just said or were you getting distracted by just staring that's what we're all here for we just want money i want money to make stuff so i want to make like [Music] are cool i think mansions are really cool somebody at your door it it's not what it looks like i'm just talking it's an interview thanks man did you take adderall i used to but it basically killed my personality like it made me dead inside youtube yes yes me too yes yeah yeah it made me uh very unfunny and boring so um yeah exactly that's why i was assuming you're on adderall well i mean like how bad is this what what what'd you say what nothing what why are you laughing not like i just i can tell you adhd yesterday i my girlfriend woke me up and i was having a nightmare and i woke up from the night i was like oh and i farted to think that it's a fart but it was the [ __ ] and it went all over my bed are you gonna remember any of my any of our conversation no but uh that's the beauty of a vod is i could just watch it if i wanted to but i i won't yeah who watches vlogs do you talk to yourself yes oh that's how no way how big my room is oh wow your room is huge can you like turn your camera to the other side like like can you like think a little bit baby it's kind of it's gonna be really hard it's huge room dang there's more wow do you have those fancy bathrooms where you got like a giant bathtub and stuff uh yes but i just walk outside usually in pee literally five minutes ago before you called me i was i peed outside and my neighbor saw me i'm like howdy he was like he's like that's a weird hose man like yep you have a dog i i would love to have a dog oh my god oh my god i wanna dude i want a french bulldog i want an english bulldog wait do you have this isn't this my interview why are you why are you telling me your life i don't this is not an interview it's a hangout it's a banter it's a podcast it's it's called miko makes friends it's where i try to make friends [Music] do you think we would have been friends in high school no yeah me neither when's the first time when's the first time you got your first kiss kiss yeah 20 22. wait really yeah i sucked dick back in high school but i was 22 when i got my first kiss nice i was a absolute loser nerd played world of warcraft every day and i hated every second of it same did you like high school no i hated high school i was can you answer my question i hated high school oh okay did you five urinals inside my bathroom and not my bathroom but inside the high school bathroom and i would i would only pee in the urinal based on the day of the week so monday was the one all the way to the left and the right one was all the way to friday and the reason why i would pee in like each one is to get closer to friday and get myself more and more excited to get to the weekend really you did that yup i did it every day isn't that cool yeah my chat is just spamming emily what the [ __ ] is that uh look she was in the boys bathroom more than i was but i don't want to talk about her that's okay who what what she's my sister oh yeah your sister i've seen her streams here and there probably on youtube she stretched once and she got she got 2 million views 50 000 followers on instagram and she went up 15 of people on her only dance from literally she came on my stream for five minutes and stretched that's all she did ah your sister's a proper business lady i like her yes she gets it from you uh i look there's a lot of things she gets from me but uh nah she'd suck a lot of dick i mean you want me yeah yeah she would just suck a lot of dick uh and that's pretty much it there's nothing wrong with that sucking dick yeah there's nothing wrong with talking a lot of dick no i mean it pays the bills you know it's fine i don't have a problem with it your sister doesn't suck today for bills she used to and then now she just dude only fans is a joke she literally just shows her ass and gets like she makes like a hundred thousand dollars every two months or something like that it's crazy so some would say 50 000 a month she makes a lot of money 50 000 a month yes isn't that crazy yes there's porn it's it's not about the porn so i've asked her i said why do people do this a lot of them uh sub to her just to say yo and just so they could talk to my sister because it's [ __ ] weird and then another reason why people like to sub to her only fans is because they like the feeling of talking to a woman you have to talk to them uh so that's usually what they do like oh here's my ass and by the way i'll message you at night when you're lonely so they'll be like oh like emily like you're really great i love your personality she's like oh my god thanks uh you know and then there'll be a pay wall they'll pay more and then they'll talk to her that's actually how it works seriously yeah they they literally pay her money to talk to her isn't that kind of sad isn't that what twitches so who's got the worst adhd here i don't know you're pretty impressive oh uh shout out to your boyfriend for picking up the gumboots that is like chat that's someone from chat named logie too why g2 he's my mod how did he get in your stream because he wanted to streak for you i guess say hi to og two see you
