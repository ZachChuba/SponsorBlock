hey friends welcome back to the vlog now a question that no one ever asks me is Ali you're a doctor who saves lives and stuff what do you do when you're not at work so to answer that question I'll take you through a random day off where I tried my best to be super productive to combat the inevitable existential dread normally I wake up at 6:30 to get to work on time but today I set my alarm for 7:30 a.m. but end up snoozing it until half-past eight and then just lying in bed doing absolutely nothing until 9:00 at 9 a.m. I negotiate myself out of bed into the shower and into a somewhat fresh pair of clothes by 9:30 I've packed my bag and I'm ready to leave the house but the urge to open my bowels delays me by another 20 minutes not to have my productivity thwarted by mere biology I bust out my phone and start writing the voiceover script for this very video I leave the house at 10 a.m. and drive to Cambridge Town Center parking in the Grand Arcade shopping center by 10:30 I've taken a seat at my favorite coffee shop in town Jamaica blue and after ordering a cheeky latte and a vegan brunch hashtag save the planet I make a start on marking some physiology essays it takes me around an hour and a half to get through five of the 10 essays that I need to mark but alongside I keep track of what factors go into a good essay for an upcoming video but for example I immediately realized why the introduction of an essay is so vitally important because it's actually really hard as an examiner to actually maintain concentration and read and understand every word of a student's essay especially if the handwriting isn't great but there's usually a pretty good correlation between how good the introduction is and how good the overall essay is this is something I like to call the halo effect so if you're a student writing an essay you want your introduction and general production value of the essay you know the handwriting the diagrams you want all of that to be fairly top-notch so that if an examiner is feeling lazy they're more tempted to give you a high mark because immediately at a glance they see that your essay looks the part anyway at 12:15 p.m. I head to the restaurant bills for lunch with a lovely chap called Liam who I randomly ran into outside the hospital a few days ago he recognized me from my videos we had a brief chat and turns out he's an ex professional footballer who's now a business coach who helps grow and scale businesses this is exactly what I'm trying to do at the moment and so we arranged to meet up and we end up chatting about general life and business strategy for the next hour and a half at 2:00 p.m. we part ways and thanks to all the tea and coffee I'd consumed throughout the morning and of taking another trip to the bathroom premium subscription isn't that exciting after extricated myself from the bills bathroom I decide to have another work session and head to my second favorite study location in town and that's the Waterstones bookshop cafe I grab a cheeky Earl Grey tea and spend another 90 minutes finishing marking the essays I find that marking essays is actually quite fun when you're doing it in a nice a Dilek location with good ambience and by the end of it I've refreshed my knowledge of nerves muscles and cardiac physiology which is a good bonus at 3:30 p.m. I quickly go through the mock exam paper that my students and I will be going over that evening to make sure that most of it makes sense and then at 3:40 p.m. I head out of Waterstones and back into the Grand Arcade shopping centre to pick up a new bike the bike shop guy recognizes me from YouTube and actually has his own YouTube channel and so we chat a bit about what it's like to be a d-list celebrity and about creating content on the internet by 4:30 p.m. the bike is sorted I've done a test ride and so I grab some doughnuts for the students as a New Year Street and drive over to Girton College for the physiology supervision the supervision lasts around an hour and in that time we go through the mock multiple-choice exam paper that they all did yesterday under time conditions and I give them some general advice about what makes a good essay at 6:30 p.m. I Drive back into town park in some random side road and make my way towards anglia ruskin University's Mumford Theatre for this year's Addenbrooke's pantomime which is put on by medical students at Cambridge University and this year it's called the little made it tells the story of a natural sciences student called Ariel who's desperate to become a medical student and the evil octopus Ursula who's trying to take over the world I took part in the pantomime for all three of my clinical years first as a singing troupe member then as a director and then as a cast member and aside from this YouTube channel it's the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life and so it'll always have a place in my heart personal favorites from this year were a parody of Shawn Mendes his absolute banger treats you better which in this context was all about the NHS the UK's National Health Service and how it's terrible and how we can treat you better with private health care and a parody of the classic song you've got a friend in me except they changed the lyrics so it's you've got an STD instead for the under for teens amongst us STD stands for sexually transmitted disease sorry YouTube please don't deem monetize this video the pantomime finishes at 11:00 p.m. I say hello to a few people outside the theatre and then drive home to back up the copious footage I filmed from today I make my customary nighttime peppermint tea and sit on the sofa to write the script for this very video hashtag meta then at around 1:30 a.m. I decide to leave the house and head home to San Albans where my family lives and on the way I pick up one of my friends who's staying over tonight so that is basically the end of this kind of day in the life what I get up to on a day off work I hope you found that vaguely entertaining enjoyable useful possibly not but if you've reached the end of the video then thank you so much for watching you are amazing if you liked the video please do give it a thumbs up because a it's awesome and be it help support the channel thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video goodnight [Music] [Music] [Music]
