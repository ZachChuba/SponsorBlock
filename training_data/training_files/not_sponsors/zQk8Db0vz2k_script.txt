hey what is going on you guys it is mr nose sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today we bring you loot from 3 000 mutated blood velds found in the catacombs of corinne as soon as you're at the altar you can either run east or west and each side will contain blood velds the west side is what was chosen for this video and all you need to get here as seen on screen is a pickaxe you just have to mine a few rocks in order to get to these blood velds so really just the inventory for this video is the uh pickaxe a superset a crafting cape and construction cape for banking and of course a bone crusher so that we need no prayer potions at all for this not only is this really good for afk training and especially if you're on a slayer task here but this bone crusher is really good for anywhere in runescape but especially the catacombs this is because any time you kill a monster in the catacombs with this bone crusher amulet or just the normal bone crusher you do get prayer points back so it's essentially just free prayer points free prayer potions almost and finally for the special attack weapon a sarah doman god sword was used and this is best in slot for slayer no doubt about it very useful for training and that's what this video was was basically a whole lot of training because none of this was done on task i mean it's pretty crazy to just kill blood velds while you're on slayer task especially if it's just for a loot video and this was done by our good friend wiggy so a big shout out to him um a lot of these drops were useful for his iron ironman specifically the blood runes and using no supplies really does make this beneficial especially for ironman accounts so these mutated blood builds were released into the game june 9 2016 at a combat level of 123 the examine option does say the twisted tongue of evil this blood belt can be assigned by five different slayer masters and it is one of the best xp tasks as it goes for you know medium combat players i remember on my iron man around 80 to 90 combat whenever i got a mutated bloodveld task i remember always getting a strength level or you know a lot of clue scrolls so this is a beneficial task to some people uh other people not a big fan of it i would imagine the normal blood veld you know was released into the game january 26 2005 and essentially the mutated is just a stronger version of that one you do need 50 slayer to kill them and they are found in the catacombs of corinne the ironworth dungeon and the meyer ditch laboratories like regular blood velds the mutated blood vessels attacks are magic based melee they are known to damage frequently due to their high attack levels so wearing magic defense armor and not using prayer is ideal or you can wear prayer equipment and just use protect from melee and that works just as well this is definitely a time-consuming task you know it's better experience than normal blood velds and they also drop more blood runes at a higher rate compared to the normal blood veils not to mention you know if you do kill them in the catacombs you're looking at ancient shards and dark totem pieces although the dry streak for totem pieces during this video was pretty extreme which you will see here very shortly if you do decide to do the level 3 clue scrolls that these blood velds do drop which is at a rate of 1 in 128 then this will certainly take you longer uh you know if you do all the clues other than the blood runes they also drop fire air and soul runes uh the amount of air and fire are much more than the souls but nevertheless you know all these runes will add up by the end of the price check on the normal drop table you're looking at coins as well as gold ore a meat pie mithril bar bowstring and of course the ruby amulets there's many other weapons and armor pieces that are dropped by these blood velds as well so high alks are very much needed if you're going to be camping this task if you're like me and wiggy here and you want to collect all the drops for a specific loot tab or even a loot video then definitely do that you know hideouts would not be necessary for that but due to the fact that there's a lot of mithral items even a couple black items adamant items and rune items it wouldn't be a bad idea to look into bringing a rune pouch with some high alks in it at this point in the video with about 500 kills remaining you know you can kind of see that drop tab really growing here and i imagine it was not fun to pick up all of those individual items especially the unnoted ones which are most of them so must have been really difficult so we thank wiggy for his efforts there and the highlight of this video really is all of the clue scrolls because as we all know you really can't get a rare from a blood veil there's just really nothing there on the drop table so with all that being said loot from 3 000 mutated blood belts has been completed it is time to now look at the biggest shortcut of them all rune light loot tracker 3 000 kills shown 8 mil exactly with 26 hard clues 10 ancient shards and 2 totem pieces also shout out to that shield left half that was a one in 11 000 drop so i mean i guess there is rares here but certainly nothing uh too valuable so now it is time to open up all 26 hard clue caskets and if we get any masters then wiggy will of course try to do them he is an iron man account so there is limitations to master clues compared to a normal main such as myself but he does have most requirements so hopefully we can get a lot of these masters complete more loot for the loot video you gotta love that and the irony of that the very first hard clue casket that was opened contained a master clue scroll so luckily he was able to complete this but that's certainly off to a good start you know in the previous video there was a hundred easy clues opened and not a single master from those so it's nice to see the masters are starting to come in yes indeed that is a back-to-back master clue from these hearts very nice to see that still got 24 more to go and two masters already in the bank so really looking forward to seeing what is inside of those overall on this account uh wiggy does have over 800 hearts completed so you know this is always a benefit of these loot videos just seeing what is inside of these caskets because you know some people will have to spend money on blood veil tasks uh you know just has to happen for some people so you know these clue scrolls will always make back some of that gp and one thing that i didn't mention earlier while these clues are getting open is the fact that there is a superior blood feld and that does drop an imbued heart eternal gem or dust and missed battle staff so technically there is a rare on the drop table but it is literally from the biggest and the baddest blood veld of them all and that's usually always a gamble if you're gonna get that wall on task another master clue was seen during the openings of these but unfortunately an infernal axe was needed so that one had to be dropped there's a few master steps that i can't do on my main as well so i know the feeling but shortly after that a third master clue was obtained once again and that was able to be completed so overall three master caskets and uh hopefully we see some mimics from that as well that could be uh something another trivia fact for you about these blood velds in february of 2017 the insatiable blood veld was given a graphical update to be more distinguishable from their regular variant and you can also find blood velds in god wars they were released in that side of the game october of 2013 and they do look a little more i would say burgundy red than uh you know tongue pink so shout out to that and with all these hard clue scrolls being open from 26 it looks like 3.25 mil was made as well as four master clue scrolls and three of those being completed as well so now we'll go ahead and open up the master clues looks like from the very first one just over 500k and from the second one closer to 300k so not too bad from the very final master casket it looks like a mimic was uh spawned so we'll go ahead and go kill that and see what uh what is obtained from that you know increased odds of third age and also another role on a master casket so you never know what is possible with these mimics never seen third age in the loot series never seen a master clue pet even if it's not on my account i still want to see it on the series one day so let's hope for the best in regards to that and if you are curious feel free to check out the description uh there's all sorts of blood veld videos on youtube regarding all the different locations you can kill them at the most efficient gear and the most efficient strategies for iron man and main account so a big shout out to all the old school youtubers that posted videos they all will be in the description below so feel free to check that out 600 death runes was the extra roll from the mimic and overall the master clue wasn't so bad itself but yeah nothing too crazy from those master caskets or the hard caskets but maybe next time you know it'll definitely add to the price check now it is time to actually do the price check from the blood velds uh the very first price check coming out to be 5.5 million over 10 000 blood runes and 150 plus insole heads that is a lot of the value just in those items and now we'll go ahead and throw in all of the other items this is most of the armor pieces and weapon pieces from the blood velds and all of this comes out to be a nice 3.1 million certainly more than i expected to see from such a xp based monster you know you don't see a lot of people pick up the drops here understandably so and from the third price check this is more so a lot of the clue scroll loot a couple other things as well and this one does come out to be just about 2.1 million the only last thing that we have left to price check is the master clues and i believe those all came out to be just about 1.6 mil so you have 5.5 plus 3.1 plus all of the clue scroll loot comes out to be 12.3 mil in total with very limited supplies used just about 40k used in supersets this was about 90 to 100 kills an hour and the prayer bonus was at just about plus 28 all in all 30 hours this would take without the clue scrolls and 33 hours with the clue scrolls decent amount of combat xp as well i believe in a shared category over 1 million xp was gained so these are really good xp and the drops weren't too bad either so with all that being said thank you guys so much for watching and you know if you're getting time guys thank you so much for watching mr no sleep out
