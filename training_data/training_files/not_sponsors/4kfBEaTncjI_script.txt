to move this lawnmower I need to apply a force to it but it's also important to note that that force it's also applied back to myself I can show this by trying to push the lumo without bracing myself like standing on one foot you may know this as Newton's third law of motion where each action has an equal and opposite reaction by applying Newton's second law of motion where force equals mass times acceleration we can work out the relative acceleration of each object if we ignore all the frictional forces like the frictional force between the wheels of the Norma and the ground if the mass of the lawnmower was the same as the mass of myself we both accelerate at the same rate in opposite directions as soon as my hands leave the handlebar of the lawnmower the force between us ends and so does the acceleration in either direction but we'll both have an enveloping in the direction and we can actually work out the relative velocity between us by using the law of conservation of momentum we calculate momentum by multiplying an object's mass by its velocity and by applying conservation of momentum to this example we can say that the end momentum of the loma is equal to the end momentum of myself now I know the mass of myself so I can actually calculate the velocity that I will push back by depending on whether I use a really heavy object like this Norma traveling very slowly or a very light object traveling very quickly like shooting a bullet from a gun this law of conservation of momentum can also be applied to rotating objects such as this wheel now this wheel has a very low mass in comparison to myself so I would need to rotate it to a very high velocity in order to give it enough momentum in this case angular momentum because it's rotating in order to give myself enough momentum to rotate in the opposite direction however it should be enough to at least make me lose balance okay that example was quite terrible so I think I need to go and build a test rig to try to explain it a bit better now reaction wheels work in exactly the same way as that bicycle wheel did however as I mentioned because the mass of the bicycle wheel was very very low and the mass of my body weight is much higher I would need to accelerate the world very very quickly in order to move my body weight in the opposite direction so I've made a small test truck here to try and give a better example of how reaction wheels work here you can see a heavy aluminium disc which is mounted to the shaft of an electric motor which is mounted to the backside of this blue plate now this blue plate and the whole assembly here is mounted to a pivot which it's balanced about to simulate a satellite in space or a drone in midair it doesn't want to swing back to be self level in its current state now if I apply voltage to this electric motor it all causes will to spin in whatever direction the motor was wired up for and this will increase the angular momentum of this wheel and because angular momentum has to be conserved it will also apply angular momentum to this blue plate so for example if the disc were to spin clockwise the blue disc would spin in the opposite direction counterclockwise now I haven't just wired this straight up to a battery with a switch instead I've put some gyros and accelerometers on the backside of this plane which should cause the plate to try and self level itself with this white pad being the top of the plate so if I were to put it out an angle like this it should try and spin the wheel in a certain direction to bring this foam pad up to the top again so let's plug it in and see if this test ring works let's plugged in and I put a certain angle so it should be able to correct itself and [Music] there we go it's brought the white pad up to level now the wheel is become stationary now because it doesn't need to impart any more angular momentum on to this blue pad because it's where it wants to be now what's also interesting about this test rig is that if I apply an external force to this blue plate the gyros and accelerometers will detect that and therefore spin the wheel in the direction that I post trying to absorb all of the angular momentum let's give this a go you see that it spins the motor in a certain direction to try and absorb the rotation of this blue plate now what's important to know about reaction wheels that they can become what's called saturated which basically the motor won't spin any quicker and therefore it can't accelerate the wheel any more than its current rpm and this is a big issue with satellites and I think it might be an issue with this drone if I bring it back to level the motor should stop [Music] so now have two wheels this was the reaction wheel which was mounted onto the experimental test rig and this wheel will be mounted onto the drone now this first wheel weighs 194 grams and this one weighs 85 grams so it's less than half the weight of this first wheel now going back to the equation for linear momentum which I mentioned at the start of this video where mass times velocity equals momentum it would suggest that this will would have a far greater momentum than this will if they're both rotated at the same velocity but I think we need to take a look at the equation for angular momentum instead this is the equation for angular momentum instead of being mass times velocity it's in fact moment of inertia times angular velocity which is the rate that the spins at but the important part is the moment of inertia if we apply conservation of momentum to this we can say that the inertia of the drone times the rotational rate of the drone is equal to the inertia of the wheel times the rotational rate of the wheel now basically what we want to do is maximize the rotational rate of the drone so that we have full attitude control of the drone and the way that we can do this is either decrease the inertia of the drone or increase the angular momentum of the wheel by either increase in the inertia of the wheel or the angular velocity now we can't increase the angular velocity anymore than the electric motor is rated for because it will only spin up to a maximum rpm so basically what we're working with is the inertia of the wheel and the drone so do you have this as high as possible we need to have a really high inertia wheel and a really low inertia drone so let's talk about the inertia of the wheel to calculate moment of inertia of either a disk or a ring these are the following equations as you can see for a solid disk like this first reaction wheel the equation is 1/2 M R squared which is 1/2 times its mass times its radius squared whereas for a ring which is similar to this obviously - in the spokes middle we can see that the moment of inertia is mass times its radius squared so for these two objects if they were the same mass and the same radius then the ring would have double the amount of moment of inertia as a disc so basically what this means is that the radius has a larger effect on the moment of inertia than the mass does because it's squared so if you were to double the radius it's equivalent to x in it by four whereas if you have to double the mass it's just the same as x in it by two so this solid disk although it weighs well almost where weighs over double the amount of this disk they actually have equal amounts of inertia now because this is slightly more complex shape than just a simple ring what I did is I designed these two disks in my camp program and if I look at the calculations in the cam program I can prove that they both have the same amount of inertia so what does this mean in terms of this project well here I have two reaction wheels both have the same moment of inertia and when attached to the same electric motor will have the same angular velocity this means they'll both be able to impart these same angular momentum onto the drone but this will weighs half as much as this will which will not only reduce the overall weight of the drone because this obviously weighs a lot less and will hopefully increase the flight time of the drone it also allows the drone to run much smaller motors in order to lift this wheel rather than this wheel which will therefore decrease the inertia of the drone which also assists to increase the angular velocity of the drone so not only have we kept the inertia the same we've managed to decrease the inertia of the drone which is as I mentioned before is very important for increase in the angular velocity and therefore keeping the drone under control so I think it's time to get building with this drone before I complete the build of this reaction wheel drone I want to run through a few of the components that are chosen to use to control the reaction wheels here you can see two brushed motors mounted perpendicular to each other 90 degrees and on the output shafts of these motors will be mounted the reaction wheels now these will be able to control the roll and pitch axis and I won't be having a will for the yaw axis because I'm going to do that through aerodynamic control of the propellers now I've chosen to go for brushed motors over more modern brushless motors because it's very difficult to control a brushless motor at very slow revolutions per minute they either need some kind of encoder or Hall effect sensor to know the exact position of the rotor it's always a very difficult to change direction of a brushless motor smoothly although drone speed controllers can change the direction of a brushless motor it usually does a very hard braking maneuver and a very hard acceleration maneuver when changing direction and I reckon this will cause issues with the reaction wheel when the drone is in midair with a brush motor you can simply change the direction of the voltage and current and it will just decelerate the motor and accelerate it smoothly in the other direction the other reason is that these motors have a gearbox which means the reaction will can receive a lot of torque from the motor without spinning too quickly and causing any kind of gyroscopic issues to drive these brushed motors I have a motor driver down in the bottom of here the motor driver can drive both motors which is quite handy and it's controlled via this Arduino Nano now in order for this Arduino Nano to know which way to spin the motors to control the drone I have a flight controller from a regular drone which I've programmed to output servo controls which can be read by the Arduino Nano now this fly controller has gyros and accelerometers in it so that you'll be able to detect any movement of the drone and I can also control the movement of the drone by using a receiver and a radio control so if I plug in a battery we should be able to see everything light up and it should arm in a second they were goat so that means the motors are all ready to spin and if I tilt the drone it should spin up one of the motives if I tilt it in this direction it should spin up this motor so yes and that motor spins and if I tilt it this way the other motor spins now I can also put my radio control here and control the direction using my sticks which means I can control the drone in midair so now I know that the gyros and accelerometers are working with the Arduino to control the reaction wheel motors I think it's time to sword up the motors to lift this thing into the air now you might be wondering Tom why you trying to control drone using reaction wheels drones fly perfectly fine as they are honestly I have no idea well I find the physics behind the reaction wheel quite interesting with the whole conservation of momentum thing and if this drone doesn't fly it's only going to be a big waste of time and money and even if this drone doesn't fly at least I've learned something and hopefully taught you something I still really hope this thing does fly though right so I know that this still looks more like a Christmas decoration then it does a drone so I've hung it from the ceiling to try and tune some of the parameters inside of the flight controller while hanging from the ceiling I basically free up one of the axes in this case is the roll axis reaction wheel and I can actually simulate what would happen if I apply an external force to it where the reaction will responds not only that but I can also take control with my radio control and make it spin see I can be pretty accurate 360s 90 degree increments so pretty good control over that axis so the erection will drone is now complete and hopefully it looks slightly more like a drawing than it used to with the propellers on the top and the bottom in terms of the controls this drone the reaction modes will control the pitch axis and the roll axis to control the gyro axis I'll be using differential thrusts of these propellers the propellers are counter rotating to prevent any torque rotation during a hover and then to control the your axis one will speed up and one will slow down and then the differential in torque will hopefully twist the drone in midair so basically this whole thing is controlled by changing the torque of an object like a propeller or a reaction wheel so I'm going to charge on the battery and then I think we're ready for a test flight I'll put the dryer on the paving slab to not only keep the propeller from hitting the grass but also to making sure that it was perfectly level if it wasn't quite level with the reaction was to try to make it level and may become saturated even before it takes off [Music] let's try that again and again ouch time for some repairs so I've made a few modifications aside from just swapping out the old broken propellers for some reason the pitch reaction wheel has far less torque than the roll reaction wheel which is really weird because I bought them from the same supplier and they're the same rated motors both rated for the same RPM and also the same gear ratio but for some reason this one has a lot more resistance or torque than this one does I'm not sure whether it has a different gear ratio or different magnets but what I've done is adjusted the settings inside the flight controller to basically rotate this wheel faster than it was doing before I've also changed the battery for a higher voltage battery which will be able to give the motors more power and also a higher end rpm which should try and delay the saturation of the reaction was a little bit longer to balance out this battery I've added some lid weights to this leg here and my plan for the next flight I haven't got that many propellers left but my plan for the next flight is just to try and get it off the ground as quick as possible and then see if the reaction wheels can take control I think if I spend too much time on the ground the reaction wheels try and fight the ground to try and roll it and pitch it and it just sort of ends up saturating them before it even takes off so let's take it out for another test flight the next few attempts didn't seem to be much better but then I took a look at the slo-mo of this flight and realized the drone was rotating about its your axis so I increased the your PID values and tried again do your axis seems to be holding now and I think we could be close to success or maybe not but then this happened the smoke mode clearly shows the reaction wheels trying to hold the drones orientation and they aren't spending anywhere near fast enough for maximum rpm saturation to be an issue as successful as this eight second flight was the following flight took a pretty hard dive resulting in a broken top motor mount so with the death of this propeller-powered reaction wheel keeps at drone looming over the horizon it was time for one last test flight so it's time to wrap up this project it's been quite a long project and also quite a long video it finally ended in destruction of this top motor mount and that last crash also managed to take both reaction wheels off of the motor shafts there's a few cracks in these legs and I think the frame actually cracked around side here as well so it definitely needs some repairs done if I want to try it again as I mentioned earlier in the video I'm using brushed motors to control the reaction wheels and the way to some controlling the torque output to the wheels is by varying the current supplied to the motor now the problem with this is that the torque output is not always relative to the current input in fact when the reaction wheels are spinning slowly they can output a really high amount of torque from the motors but when the motors are spinning quickly like if it's already at a certain angle when it needs to recover the talk reduces a lot when the wheel is at high rpm so the actual torque output is not linear and this is very difficult when you're trying to tune the parameters in the fly controller because a fly controller just thinks oh I need to apply force in this direction to get up to this direction and you have to preset it of how much force it needs to apply but when the output force is in constant it's very difficult to counteract for that basically there is a way around this some brushed motors come with encoders and I think this is the only way forward with this so basically I'll program the Arduino to measure the revolutions per minute of the motor and then instead of just varying the torque of the motor through increase in the current I can basically work out the acceleration of the motor and then apply the necessary current to try and match that acceleration so instead of having the acceleration of the wheel controlled by just the current it's actually measured and then controlled using a closed feedback loop and I think this is the only way to get a constant change in momentum of the right I could keep going on about potential solutions and improvements which I should have done on this project but I'm going to end
