well it's been a while since my review of the original Friday the 13th it's safe to assume that my criticisms of that film had to do with a lack of at least 12 different romantic subplots musical numbers and an over two hour runtime thankfully though we have the Bollywood musical remake a Friday the 13th called seven cell bud which not only has an epic poster but a plot line which seems to have been [ __ ] out by the power of dance clearly the movie was made because they knew one day an Internet reviewer would be in a predicament when a Friday the 13th happens in the same month as musical March in September the film was released in 1987 but was apparently made in 1983 and is about a married couple who purchased a mysterious hotel where guests are either murdered by a heavy melodrama or heavy knife blades just like Friday the 13th but no joke despite the plot sounding more like a Bollywood remake of mountaintop Motel massacre it actually does follow a high majority of scenes from the original Friday the 13th must be why the movie opens up by saying that it is a certified Friday the 13th so you don't accidentally end up with that Saturday the 14th [ __ ] and you know you're watching something secret when it has to blur out the production logos there's lots of information here I see the running time is the average length for a Bollywood movie 771 minutes sure no one under 18 will be permitted possibly due to the ushers passing out cigarettes and remember this is not valid for video because we are a BCD family brace yourself this movie opens like a jolt of electricity being shot right into your dick and that's just the title screen oh I can feel the power of dance already oh well so much for Pamela Voorhees being in the MCU there is a lot of mystery in this film already such as where the held the moon go I have no idea what's going on but it appears the movie is drawing me a nice hot bath wait is this the beginning of the movie now the hell does this to our Friday the 13th remake just skip to the ending I'm awfully confused too this movie is chasing its own shadow much like the original opening there is a killer and there is a campfire if you sing and dance around a fire for this long you're either gonna run into a slasher villain or a shark or Pazuzu will show up meanwhile at Jason's house you know what the creepiest thing in this hotel is [Music] the back hair definitely the back hair unfortunately there's no mirrors in the room to break and cut to the opening so that frustrates the killer I'm calling it the editor is the killer but he did find a girl to kill and a mirror to break for the opening this is too funky for the Friday the 13th opening clearly I am watching an Indian remake of Friday the 13th 3d comes with some nice dance beats and screaming guess the public relations guys saw a spider I'm mildly in love with this funkalicious theme music the credit sequence is quite long but the best part is it's still going I guess this is Annie the hitchhiking camp counselor you got to run from the killer in those shoes honey good luck every once in a while they say something in English but for the most part o menos got a video opener I've calculated people in Kigali Beach are you oh yeah sure he just said that if she pulls out a banana we'll know if she's the hitchhiker from part 4 I told you already were a BCD family this scene is too hot for the guy in the background so he casually puts on his shades that way he can look like a badass when he takes them off when talking to her she needs a ride so he'll be the truck driver too bad they couldn't stay longer Paul's has the best in Galatians food this is all really familiar ah crazier Ralph or should have seen you coming the fake subtitles don't even need to be put in I'm sure that they're all doomed and the hotel is cursed and he stole Mickey Mouse's gloves see you later on in the pantry Ralph or bye that is if they make it there should he really be driving with the blurred out production logo over his eyes this is like if the truck driver in the original tried way harder to bang a knee let's go to a happy home if something bad happens here we could sue them for false advertising it's a slasher movie so there's definitely a horny couple maybe faster [Music] sure they do it's just more awkward great I always thought Friday the 13th needed an annoying kid that's why no one saved Jason he may have saved puppies and chickens but his voice was super annoying and don't forget it is a musical [Music] Friday the 13th can't wait for the strip monopoly song blurring over that dance sequence won't be tedious at all [Music] everyone appears to be high up their ass including the cast and crew so I think they're all gonna get slaughtered but not before the song finishes I guess this is the strip monopoly song but where's the classic Friday the 13th theme wrong it's Kiki keep my mama even though it doesn't sound like that she's still a hitchhiking I guess don't know why she bothered asking these two and I also don't know why they stopped Oh to check out her ass in front of his lady friend makes sense she's angry and depressed because the amount of time left in this movie is longer than the entirety of the original Friday the 13th and rightfully so because all of this is completely necessary you know you're watching this why is this in peeping-tom vision do they even know they're in a movie right now I think these to do because they're posing for the Bollywood moment-by-moment poster as long as he has significantly less back hair than the first guy they should be saved but not from the drama and then katana why must this be so damn soap opera and don't let some good slapstick get in the way a hello hello I think I want to bang you now instead here take a bath in the opening credits and whatever this flashback is don't mind his nasty breath he probably shouldn't have eaten a whole uncooked salmon before kissing the bride just what this movie needs more characters [Music] I'm guessing he's bad oh it's just super Mario he'll save us from Bowser's murderous wrath I'm assuming they're all arguing on who has to chop the head off of the snake and the cabin you're right yes I still don't know what's going on I just have the feeling it's very love triangle II just look at this drama depth up we can defend him unity suppose what the guy said looked up to me but I didn't get up enough clever she's not even in the room anymore and you're ignoring the biggest threat in this hotel flashbacks [ __ ] you're a danger the you're doomed gang is all here thank God Charles Bronson saves her from Bollywood nail gun massacre just another clip from the classic sequel Friday the 13th Jason Takes Miami connection I am riveted just because you don't know what's going on doesn't mean that it's not still the greatest thing ever wait what is he going to prison [Music] oh it's like if the OJ Simpson trial actually did have the dancing Ito's in it mmm no he's guilty from copper rock but it'll do the trick at least for the time being because this scene isn't even done yet even though I had 12 seizures watching this trial it's still the most exciting episode of the People's Court that I've ever seen yes I had looked up what pinnacle diminisher harsh well I guess that was a flashback of this guy I suppose sure anything else to cut to well Bollywood Ned is here excellent it's our fifth incidence of love at first just stab someone already maybe in Bollywood Nightmare on Elm Street we can actually see Jesse and Grady bang they spared no expense in dancing or stunt work no need for the slasher killer to pick them off I think they're doing a good enough job getting themselves killed the motorcycles gonna get it too since it's also having premarital sex okay graphic this is what happens when you don't have officer Dorf around to say who we don't stand for no weirdness around here we now return to a hotel uncle Rico oh I am I did whoa dad i snort too the angel dust off how you say beauties records yes we don't care if you injure your knee this may be an unlucky day but we're gonna force this musical on you or else we'll cut to the chef from sleepaway camp this movie needs an adult or at least an Angela with a big pot of boiling water um is this movie in love with me now he'll never mind he's in love with giving himself plastic surgery wait that hot sauce off your arm as you can see I'm in love with you you can use my arm as a dipping sauce for fish sticks in this movie used to have a creepy I'd murderer in it guess not anymore we just have this guy murdering the art of disco dancing this is quite the journey we're on why not sure sums up my thoughts on picking this movie for the show why not sure maybe this is like a convict slash Inspector Clouseau of the movie though I don't know about his theories just don't know if Manimal had anything to do with it now the editor on the other hand he's definitely on some [ __ ] he's got a new dance it's called I am a disco dancer as the only English sentence I know Friday the 13th really was the Catalina caper of its day this only proves that if the break-in series went on long enough it definitely would have crossed over with Friday the 13th I can't put my finger on it I just feel like a ninja should show up at some point hey remember that time when The Electric Company was slaughtered in a hotel this movie does let's go bother this guy we can win him over by switching up the tune great you switch the song and now you're stuck in a tree that's how that works and shouldn't crazy Ralph or be in their pantry at this point [Music] Wow so many new revelations are happening [Laughter] I'm not so sure I would care about this even if I did know what they're saying [Music] okay maybe I care a little shocker the inspector does not trust the convict people might've seen him in the balcony tonight afford a year well that seemed unnecessary Oh are we still on the hitch-hiker that hasn't wrapped up yet [Applause] she's lost and so is the movie wait never mind she's not lost she found Friday the 13th she's being chased by a runaway collection of stock footage I've never seen a movie literally chase its climax she appears to want the movie to end so bad that she pulls in the camera and the killer to stab herself and she was transitioned to death this is getting suspenseful I appreciate this movie wants to stay in shape but choose your own time for your aerobics workout this looks like if the 70s tried making a slasher movie variety show why not they did a variety show on everything else this could have replaced pink lady and Jeff ooh can't blood can you dig it [Music] why not just call the movie Saturday the 14th Night Fever makes sense zoom I'd ever thought a slasher movie could be a great double feature with John Travolta dude in solido destino oh that's right Travolta's ploy tation exists I would ask myself how there's still 50 minutes of this movie left but I think this sequence and all of them like it answer that question they've been going on for 12 hours do we ask them to stop no we join in even if crash zoom a great face ends everyone's good time still better than our movie going on outside [Music] I sure hope that's the ninja that I asked for earlier mmm this is definitely the check of the movie over in this country they have a game called six degrees of this guy he has the magic touch of five seconds of sex and a quick putting the clothes back on cut sounds like he's also cursed I'm sensing some killers and thieves because she stole Kevin Bacon's death scene oh good it's now Bollywood Forrest Gump didn't highlight Kentucky episode it's a boy darling I don't know what that means but I do know someone is killed with a hot poker so the opening credits called it they did add some Friday the 13th 3d ingredients that also means Bollywood one from the heart is gonna creep in I mean practically the same movie oh damn without the subtitles I don't know what they're saying this is being filmed in jealous vision at least someone wants the movie to get on with its conclusion even with the word salad I know those words but I don't know if that was a real conversation speaking of conversations welcome to the next act of the movie oh great he's gonna make out with someone passed out isn't he thankfully his dance moves may wake them up this sequence goes on so long that I'm surprised this isn't a three-hour movie I think they start killing each other just so something happens and the crowd goes wild seriously I'm not sure if those people were really there but I can tell you this about the movie a dance scene is definitely going to happen [Music] you gotta love when a movie comes with its own music video tie-in now pay close attention I think the robot may be the killer I [Music] know this may seem weird but it's pretty par for the course at this point they're one yellows all over the world away from filming on location in Xanadu they could insert this sequence into Bollywood manikin and no one would know the difference this is the first movie where afterwards my abs are really killing me I wasn't expecting to get in this good of a workout today this is only the second weirdest General Motors short I've seen anyway enough of that daydream I'm drunk in this movie showing no signs of ending but I know at least one thing about the killer he's really damn rude G after hearing that strange sound maybe you shouldn't go up to the stormy ass rooftop to investigate stay inside and read Steve Christie's wardrobe like this guy Lord there's 30 minutes of dance for every 1 minute of plot here you go one hole Jagermeister to yourself this will make the rest go by quick with the movie now being shot in drunk vision even the people behind the camera are wasted I could have watched the first eight Friday the 13th in the amount of time it's taken with you the hell damn he's really shit-faced he must also be the cinematographer but I've got a theory now on who the killer is Pennywise the clown is everything i do recently have to be it related he'll blame it on a spider once his abusive dad comes in these stains are all gonna be added to his hotel bill and stop going to the roof when you need help a great idea if you see blood in the sink go to the highest place you can think of Oh while fighting off the paparazzi Oh No who's gonna sing about it great I guess I'll take over is the resident drunk guy the power to all our dance moves has been cut what are we supposed to do stand here and not dance when we're killed anyway stop going outside when you hear a calling for your own untimely death wait so is this guy the killer I don't know he's kind of acting like it I just feel like a big kid and a guy shouting you'll be patched up Oh God what picture gotta plan a kiss too I think I'm following this now I know that Bollywood bill is dead and stuck to the door blood your guess is as good as mine on this or anything else even other movies are appearing here's poor Bob from Bollywood Halloween and even foreign language versions of Friday the 13th have someone crashing through a window sorta never too late for a new character though even if she's confusing this for Bollywood times at the El Royale wait a minute and this is a lot like Friday the 13th [Music] what may get it clever so yes that is our killer and yes it has to do with revenge for a drowning although I have never seen Jason Voorhees death as a child being portrayed so alaria Slee sure he may have died but don't be too upset about it mrs. Voorhees at least we got a great laugh out of it dummies and ugliness again Jesus Christ that was terrifying how am I supposed to dance to that Bollywood Angelina Jolie is pissed I suppose this is gonna set up for a long chase through the hotel much like the campground in the original or maybe not that long there's only five minutes of the movie left the dance scenes are five times longer than the actual plot resolution much like Betsy Palmer the killer is the best performance in the movie they do try to drag it out though with a lot of slow motion it's a short sequence but lasts long enough for it to now be daylight I don't know how plots or weather work anymore for instance it's nighttime again and I think she's a vampire well this makes it believable that in the Friday of the 13th game mrs. Voorhees head would come to life and kill you I shouldn't have cut away we've got no time to waste seriously this is like someone pressed fast-forward on the original how does the longer version simultaneously feel like the Cliff Notes version sorry ma'am not only did we not find a boy but we also don't see a sequel anywhere in sight so that means you won't be killed at the beginning of the second film well that movie was exhausting with the singing and dancing and slasher moving all you really need to do is replace the killer with z-man and which a god is a Bollywood remake of beyond the valley of the dolls considering if it were musical March in September it would have been the actual Friday the 13th remakes spotlighted this month but I think we all know which remake is better I don't recall the 2009 Friday the 13th remake ever having a single scene in it reminiscent of John G avold sins and night in heaven which is clearly a huge flaw then again I don't think that Friday the 13th remake is 18 hours long so it's got that going for it can't wait for the Bollywood musical remake of Jaws where why do I even have to make anything up of course that movie exists now if you'll excuse me I've got more high school musicals to watch or I pray they also turn into a slasher film if anything because the title slaughter high school musical just writes itself [Music] [Laughter] you
