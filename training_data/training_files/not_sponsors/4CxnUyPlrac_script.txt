[Music] hmm [Music] okay so this one is linear hacked 64 by someone - 639 and it should be be sick please read the signs all of them are different please read the signs all of them are different but I'm going back for the signs of the joke Mario you're finally here another person get off my ass about where you were you better get to the princess if that it looks like you did something truly terrible I was kidding it was a joke it was hilarious I I'm so funny okay there's only one one hundred Queen star in the entire heck exit course takes you to the start of the whole hack so don't do it special thanks everyone and simples discord all of my soundcloud someone to 6:39 or fresh memes and that's basically it carry on access granted user Mario okay [Music] hey Mario heard you posted cringe and you're now in a pickle I'll tell you a bit about the hidden kingdoms before I send you off there are remnants of unfinished worlds from mario games and hacks whether they're a backup old version or a scrapped idea they're all there how about you see the pipe and see what's up good luck Mario okay here we go I've told you a thousand times not to post cringe on the castle laptop now look at what you've done I'm losing subscriber by the minute and look at me I'm cringing in all shapes and sizes - you'd better fix this Mario actually don't you'll just make it worse how about you clean up the hidden kingdoms while I sort this out well I had no idea I was supposed to meet range that's the problem sometimes you don't you don't know when you're posting cringe you do it on accident the star on the top welcome to Super Mario Galaxy star fortress this level is in a bare-bones stay at the moment but you should be able to get to the top without much issue if you choose to get the a Red Coins please do so before getting the start at the top of the tower I can't believe I'm being like basically shamed for having posted cringe one time everyone post cringe like that just happens sometimes what do you mean one time in quotes like I do it all the time I'm a rare cringe poster it's like happens sometimes because it's inevitable it's unavoidable but let's not get carried away of saying I'm doing it all the time I gained subscriber okay if all I'm saying Punk is [ __ ] even shut your mouth that's using that as an example for cringe what what is the point of all this okay oh um I don't think over there I mean keep in mind that this is literally an unfinished thing like that's that's the storyline what's up Mario I'm the mini boss here you just have to defeat me to pass same as usual but you can't so why even try [ __ ] what I have never seen this defeat boss block technology that is really cool what's up developer here to tell you that this star will take you all the way to the bottom of the level because I thought it would be cool I think I can get it without falling all the way to the bottom but if I do people are gonna say I posted cringe No [Music] welcome back Mario you've seen a glimpse of the hidden Kingdom so you should know what to expect now the next level is a bit more unstable because it's already in Mario 64 but hopefully everything works as it should am welcome to whom stove's fortnight it's like once fortress but solid and less stable don't try it also ignore the Koopa sound effects did you guys hear those Koopa sound effects is this supposed to be beta whomps i don't think so because beta wants recreations there's a ton of those and they look a lot different the womp king of on vacation so he left a message i've taken the liberty to translate his message so that the young young uns can understand it makes me so mad hos mad we build your houses your castles we on that grind we pave your roads and so you walk all over us with my cred bro you ever say thank you no I got fake people showing fake love to me well you're not gonna wipe your feet on me I think I'll crush you just for fun it's time to stop you have a problem with that just try to pound me King whomp [ __ ] [ __ ] me up fam be kidding my language fame gsj at Jolly Roger BAE bettin s it isn't us I'm a gent [ __ ] like last time I'm gonna yank [ __ ] it was kind of funny we finally caught you even waiting for the longest time to confront you you have desecrated us all how you ask well allow me to let you in on a board family tradition is it every [ __ ] rom hack every every [ __ ] hack is I can have two grand pound me now there's no choice the highest rank in the boards is sign boss they make all the rules but to get that rank a protagonist must ground pound them Wow who would have seen this coming certainly not me I had never knew that this would happen I have halted your progress in this hack try to transgress and you will end up losing your save ground pound these five signs and I will let you proceed I mean it's a posted cringe like that's all right that's really all there is cheating knowing no it was patient enough for me to just randomly accidentally grab time to sign which did happen by the way now everyone just forces you to do it it did happen I did actually do it on accident did I really have a ground pound home we have you all figured out Mario watch your next action will be to press a button to dismiss the text oh [ __ ] like my balls now if here's the gamble though here's where I'm at emotionally I either ground pound five signs and then I have to ground pound this anyway or I ground pound this and I never actually had to grant on them I don't want a ground pound an extra sign just jump off oh I was so on board with that [ __ ] whatever what that's kind of cool I think forcing me to ground pound the signs for the sake of the competition is a hollow victory but I'll let you have it that was impressive not gonna lie I don't know how that worked that was crazy Mario did the world load as intended we lost contact with you for a second you scared us regardless of next level is a 100 point level based on YouTube comments nothing too bad eh Oh YouTube comments that's where the most cringes the arrows are broken please fix how are they broken I like that you better believe I'm reading every comment Cades please post Z 64 or a unsubscribe I beg you bro this is so cringe I cringe so hard please fix the cringe because it's cringe am no I I like that one that that's a way better one than the thing you did before we got them again alright I have a bone to pick with chat I promoted my sand cloud and two hacks with over a thousand viewers each and I've gotten less than five followers since I've created a list of everyone who didn't follow and will discreetly remind you every competition to follow my soundcloud until you do come on guys I mean it's the least you could do is follow it's fan club nice you've conquered the 100 comments in the level hey Mario next level is kind of simple it's actually from a completely different game oh oh oh great welcome to roblox calm the only reason this level wasn't bleeded in its own room was because of the horrid background that you've never seen this color in sm64 I assume this would be quick saying it does not this is so [ __ ] weird other the yellow one here look at that look at that great um hello hello I can kinda see something are you [ __ ] kidding that better have been like an intended death without [ __ ] that was that was a max cringe post [ __ ] lie I don't get it that's I can compare it to a background it's on this is impossible this is stupid my shadows not good enough see do i time good enough dude this is this is I'm not on board with this might be the yellow I had to say I don't think that's gonna help me what do you mean chromakey okay I got you guys do you guys are gonna be like oh you posted cringe again big cringe from sim one foul crow mechanic but what's gonna go behind it just better but his work Freitas [Music] I don't know dude I just see solid yellow on my screen I want to let you grab this way I can't see dick dude it's like easy to see where they are when the cameras pointing this way but like impossible otherwise it's not just one of them so I've tried that the distance oh my god I didn't want a save state but I feel like I have to this just seems completely indiscernible I mean obviously there's like the just memory game it I could easily see me having miss something that would change the way this is visually without the back has been maybe I did it wrong that I don't really know you can now you can defeat the evil leader of the hidden kingdoms the cringe alert himself no dude if I go in here and it's a picture of me and I'm the cringe lord I'm gonna be really upset no dude okay it's just bother he often posted cringe this is cringe am i reading this that was cringe no deed
