[Music] which Souls born bossfight includes this sound effect is it a mirga's wetness be ceaseless discharge see gyobu masataka honey wha what D Osiris the consumed King vote now no hey don't look at the comments okay is that your final answer all right the answer is B ceaseless discharge that is the same sound effect as this it's just slowed down and given a lower pitch truth is ceaseless is an infant he was tragically transformed in izalith while the chaos flame was still unstable the fact that his voice is just modified from that of an actual baby makes this sad story even sadder deep in the design works of Dark Souls lies another secret from this area his name is King izalith and he was originally going to be the main boss of this area sitting on a throne lording it over the bed of chaos that was to arrive beneath him this concept is very obviously inspired by the old monk of demon souls who sits above his arena in much the same way and in turn the old monk looks very much like xanthus King Jeremiah who was a man exiled to the painted world so it's almost certain that Jeremiah is or at least was at one point the king of izalith in addition to the old monk connection there are two other things first he uses chaos pyromancies which were developed by the witches of izalith and he especially uses chaos flame whip which was wielded by the eldest daughter alone and second remember that wall hugging parasite in Blighttown that guards power within in the text files of the game this thing is called Prince izalith which really leaves little suspicion as to what kind of Paris the xanthus king is hiding beneath his bloodied yellow headpiece another NPC that was originally intended to be a boss fight was master willem who sits on the Bergen worth balcony overlooking ROMs lake in cut content Willem proclaims this desperate need for more eyes and then he decides that your eyes will do perfectly precious sacrifice in his boss mode Willem begins speaking in tongues he summons projectiles and he slams his chair down in this unnatural creepy manner to damage the player with some sort of shock wave which is unfortunately invisible alongside his projectiles in the current state of the game this was originally discovered by Lance Macdonald who often features in this series as you're probably aware so for more on this encounter go and check out his youtube channel lance revealed another piece of cut content this year and this time it's centered on the yharnam stone which is kind of at once the toughest item to find in blood-borne and also the most useless but it wasn't always this way you get this item from defeating Queen Jana in the deepest chalice dungeons and at one point if you took it to the fishing hamlet priest he had this to say time is not and the sea rumbles of far and yet a mother's pungent devotion can still be felt thank you messenger I exude gratitude for one such as you cos bless this messenger this visit are from beyond but from the fact that the priest blesses you in this dialogue instead of cursing you for a change there really is little of significance to learn from this except that in this place outside of time and outside of space the devotion of another mother can still be felt for it is the destiny of all of the great ones to lose their children and just as cause lost her often so too did Queen Yanam have Mogo taken from her it's a shame really that this no longer exists in game because an accomplishment like killing Queenie on and really does deserve something even if it's just this little line of dialogue and as of November 18th 2019 every single chalice dungeon has been explored and documented because counter to popular belief the chalice dungeons are actually finite and not truly randomly generated instead each depth of chalice dungeon pulls from a hard-coded selection of rooms with a total of 2,300 possible dungeons each one of them additionally modified by effects and rites that make them look a bit different so thanks to the folks over at the tomb prospectors reddit we now have this exhaustive list of all the effects gems bosses and discoveries inside of these places all of which can be found in the description below congratulations on this monumental achievement as we all know blood-borne is heavily based on the writings of HP Lovecraft and his cosmic horror of the unknown and the unknowable the best example of this commonly referenced is the fishing Hamlet it's similarities to love crafts shadows over Innsmouth story however in all the years since blood bonds release I feel like I've never seen anyone discussing specifically how love crafts other stories directly inspired different sections of blood-borne how the dream quest of unknown Kadath sees a man traversing sanctuaries and nightmares just like the hunter's dream and nightmare realms how a handful of stories feature cursed families who mirror the fate of blood-borne hunters or one of my favorites how the expedition into the labyrinth in Mountains of Madness somewhat inspired the chalice dungeons listen to this quote which I'm free to read to you at length thanks to this video sponsorship by audible tell me this doesn't remind you of the chalice dungeons it is absolutely necessary for the peace and safety of mankind that some of the earth's stark dead corners and unplugs depths be let alone lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black layers to newer and wider conquests that's a quote from the mountains of madness and there are so many stories like this so to help you listen to them all I managed to get an audible sponsorship for this video with the link below or by texting party video to 500 500 for a

audio books in their enormous library that you do decide to keep are yours forever speaking of enormous libraries a surprising number of the books in Sates archives actually have legible titles perhaps the most notable one is this one it's a real book written by French author Paul acha titled Letizia de vivre which translates to the desire to live pretty suitable title in a game like this number 8 no one really ever expects to be hit by that melancholy piano when you first go through the final boss folk in the kiln of the first flame it's the climax of your journey and yet you're facing this sad husk of a man to the tune of this simple piano piece it's striking from a story standpoint it's brave as a compositional choice but also it might be impressive technically as well for the name Gwyn means white and his theme is best played entirely with all the white keys on a piano it's likely that this took some conscious restraint on the part of the composer and it could even be an effort at Madrigal ISM where they set the word Gwyn or white to music in a way that illustrates its literal meaning of course it could be still coincidence but I kind of think coincidence can still be meaningful and I think this is one of those times but maybe those with more musical knowledge can weigh in on this in the comments below Gwyn's soul was split and given to a few in his entourage most notably to seethe and also the four kings however there is one misleading statement in the English that has to do with his four knights whose souls read Gwyn granted this soul to his four trusted Knights and this actually isn't true instead these souls are more accurately read the so loved one that was counted among four nights of kinguin and it's unlikely that he granted them power in the same manner that he did to save and the four kings in a recent episode on semper temple we told the story of how code zero ends up in the illusory holes finally reunited with the rejuvenating children a group of invisible kids sacrificed in experiments on immortality and in his final scene code 0 is seen talking to them all but you don't actually just have to take his word for it that they're there they actually are as terrible as it sounds if you attack the space where they're sitting you get that visual effect that shows whenever you try to kill a protected NPC they're there and you gotta love the extra thought that went into this speaking of killing NPCs when you go to fight Hawkwood in the final battle we're met with this entitled arrogant character who is determined to kill us and take the Dragonstone from our person but in the Japanese his dialogue gives a more gentle heroic spin on the character this is a character that we've seen shy away from his destiny throughout the ages never standing up for himself and in the end instead of the English proclaiming that he shall take that which is rightfully his in the Japanese he actually says something more like he will receive recognition by defeating us and when we defeat him he calmly states well if you are the dragon then that isn't so bad another character that's deeper than most know is griggs who really may not be who he says he is the black sorceress said that he wears states that there is a secret sect of sorcerers at vinhai' academy dedicated to covert operations and while Griggs maintains this guise of a humble apprentice to master Logan there really is a lot of deception built into his character first Griggs has a selection of spells that you can learn from but the only spell that is not willing to teach to you is a spell called hush which is a spy sorcery developed by a nameless sorcerer at the shadow even hime institution second he sells two rings for accomplished sorcerers where's and doesn't sell the slumbering dragon crest ring worn by the aforementioned surreptitious sorcerer at vin home more than this though I think we're supposed to question his behavior while he claims that he's an apprentice to Logan Logan never once mentions the apprenticeship and even when they're in the same shrine they stand apart from one another it's certainly clear that he is a passionate admirer of Logan but it's also clear that he has some murky motivations as he shadows Logan around Lordran still passing along information to the vin hime school that he left while we're in Dark Souls remastered did you know it's possible to visit the old battle of Stoicism arena jump onto this ledge quit out before dying and then reload onto the fence take a jump at this angle and deal there another thing that you probably didn't know was possible is that you can stagger slave night Gale and even open him up for a riposte the trick is to hit his pea sized head whether it's with godlike accuracy with a bow or more likely a weapon that has a really abnormal head box like on a kitty and uber touchy did you ever do this when he played the game let me know what weapon you used and finally number 15 the genius behind sequitos combat system is Masuda Yamamura its lead gameplay designer in blood-borne also there is a character called Yama Mora and he's an Eastern styled character in blood-borne of all places it makes you wonder if this all the way back then was an early reference to secular and a reference to the man that would become its lead gameplay designer Dark Souls after all also had something like this they had the Gothic flavoured Chester who was pulled from another world so it makes you wonder if he was pulled from blood-borne and if Dark Souls was alluding to that game all those years ago so maybe secreto has something in it that's alluding to Eldon ring who knows before I go on guys again I am actually I've accumulated thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time
