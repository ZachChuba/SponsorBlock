You said you weren't cute. But the members responded that you were cute. Right! Am I cute? I'm not! I look very strong on the outside, but I have a soft side inside. But I am strong!(???) Am I cute? I don't want to be cute. She's right! But sometimes she looks cute unintentionally. When is she the cutest? Usually.... She's not usually cute.... but.... Look at her face! She hates to be called cute. Look at her eyes. She is like a child. She is pure....? Yeah! I'm pure! I agree!!! Does it mean that her soul is clear? Well...... I'm pure!!!! She was hooked on the word 'pure'! Not cute but pure! Your dream is to be a psychic, right? Yes, I am~ You said you wanted to be a phoenix. Sudden mission! Please make an acrostic poem with 'Phoenix(Bool Sa Jo)'. (Bool) Like a flame~ (Bool GGok Churum~) (Sa) Let's love each other. (Sa Rang Ha Ja~) (Jo) I like you, IDLE~~~ (Jo Ah He, IDLE~) My name is 'God So Yeon'! Send a video letter to the phoenix. To phoenix? Marco.... (Embarrassed) This is the first video letter for a phoenix. Dear. Phoenix Marco
I want to have your ability someday. If I were to eat the fruit of the bird, I would use my ability only for good things. Thank you for being my dream. This is the first video letter for a phoenix!! (Not finish) Send a video letter to your ideal type, 'Zoro'. (OMG) Dear. Zoro You were so hurt by Kuma that you didn't show anything to your friends. That's when I fell in love with you. I don't know what you think of me, I always want to resemble you and marry someone like you. Please accept my proposal. Sudden Question! Please hold up the OX board. Q. I knew I would succeed this much. I don't know the exact criteria for 'this much' But I think I still have a long way to go. Because I am the hero of my life. 'I'm the hero of my life, and I'll be something' 'Will I succeed?' I always think like this. I'm always running towards my dream. I trust!!! I believe that I will be successful. The last video letter remains. Who...? You picked ZICO as the singer you want to collaborate with. What is his charm? ZICO! First of all, he raps very well. Also, make songs trendy well. I especially like the lyrics he wrote. Dear. ZICO! Hello~ I'm So Yeon in (G)I-DLE! I usually enjoy listening to your songs. I learn a lot by listening to your song. The lyrics you wrote move me. The songs you make amazes me and teach me. If I could collaborate with you later, I would be very happy. Always cheer up and stay healthy. Thank you very much~! She sent a letter to her idol. This is the first time we're revealing it on the air. To be continue~!
