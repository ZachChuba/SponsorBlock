A new year is a great opportunity to reset,
think of new goals and plan for all of those things you’ve been meaning to do but never
found the time to actually do. I’ve always enjoyed December because it’s
just a great time to reflect upon what the year has brought you and align your goals
for the following twelve months. It’s a time to celebrate and feel grateful
but also a time to be ambitious, get out of your comfort zone and prepare for a new exciting
year. Until the end of the month, we’ll be focusing
on how to get the most out of this transitional period and start 2020 off the right foot. I like to start simple. A simple to-do list can be created using a
scrap of paper or your default digital app and will clarify your intentions for 2020. Pouring onto paper all of your wishes, concerns
and reflections for the new year is a great way to get started. There are a few lists you can make *right
now* that will help you improve your mindset and get organized. The **first** list you should make should
include all the things you still need to take care of before the year ends. These will be the things you’ve been putting
off for months, like scheduling appointments, decluttering your wardrobe, doing some admin
work or anything of the sorts. The best way to start off 2020 well is making
sure you’ve drawn a clear line between your past duties and future ones and avoid transitioning
any tasks that will otherwise slow down the process of other more interesting things in
your schedule. Secondly, it’s a great idea to create a
reading list for the new year. I’ve mentioned this briefly in my 10 ways
to read more books video and I think it’s a great to way to commit to reading specific
books while also setting the mood for the rest of the year. I will share, down below, my list of 12 books
to read in 2020 in case you need some recommendations. The third list is a list of sustainable purchases
or swaps for the new year. I think it’s a great idea to start the year
off with self improvement as well as trying to change a few habits that may not impact
you directly but impact the world around you. I’ve committed to using cloth napkins instead
of paper napkins, reusable pads to remove eye makeup, a refillable pen and trying out
some goldbee wraps. Actually, tell me down below what are you
sustainable and eco friendly purchases because I would love to see this list grow. My fourth list is called “To-do & Projects”
and these are basically things that I look forward to do in the next year that are a
little bit more complex and require a different workflow or preparation. I’ve included things like learning the basics
of sewing, writing an eBook, finishing renovating my bedroom and traveling to the UK. These projects will all have their specific
pages in Notion where I will schedule and plan each different step I need to take in
order to get there. List number five is more of a workflow rather
than a list. I have different versions of this; a finance
& budgeting organization schedule slash workflow that establishes an ideal way for me to keep
track of everything and communicate effectively with my accountant over the year. It includes deadlines, a list of documents
I should email to different entities and so on. I also have a list of puppy related dates
and things I have to remember, such as vaccines, check ups, puppy class appointments, etc;
and of course, a major wedding planning list that I will share with you next year. Finally, a very important thing to plan before
2020 arrives is your yearly budget. I've actually created a draft of my 2020 budget
six months ago but I always update it and check everything in December to change up
some values taking into account any changes that might have happened until now. I keep my budget on a google spreadsheet but
I like to link it to a main page in my Notion planner to access it easily during planning
sessions. Sponsor: If you look at your 2020 budget and find out
your budget is too tight to enroll in on-site classes to ba able to learn a new hobby or
improve in an area you're passionate about, online classes are always a great way to manage
your time **and** budget, since they are affordable and allow you to decide when you are learning,
and how. I hope you enjoyed today's video and I will
see you next week. Bye guys!
