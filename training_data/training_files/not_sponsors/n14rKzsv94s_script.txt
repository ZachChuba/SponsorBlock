(Nervous) but then...?! can you eat spicy food..? (Ddu Ddu's official statement)
I like spicy food! I wanna belong to those who are super good at eating spicy food~ but I'm not that good at eating it! So this one is made of Cheongyang peppers*
*Korean chili pepper Cheongyang Peppers + Tteokbokki* +
*Spicy Korean stir-fried rice cake Cheongyang pepper + Tteokbokki + Garlic + Cheongyang pepper + Tteokbokki + Garlic + King-sized dumpling I named it Cheong-Tteok-Gar-King which stands for Cheongyang pepper Tteokbokki Garlic King-sized dumpling! This one here is garlic This is garlic!? (Ddu Ddu is confused😨... Is this a giant garlic...?) Oh I'm sorry this one isn't a garlic hahaha This one is a dumpling (Yul* having a side effect on waking up early)
Right? It's a dumpling no matter how long I look at it 😂
*Nickname of Yuri There's garlic inside the dumpling if you see in it! If you knock-knock on the dumpling and open it If you knock-knock on the dumpling and open it the garlic comes out (A Tteokbokki set menu full of Korean spirit) It looks so good! There's cuttlefish and seafood in the Tteokbokki! It might be a little~ bit spicy But i didn't make it super spicy so try it! And this one here is called Jeonju* Bibim Rice ball
*City in Korea that's famous with Bibimbap There's cheese in it (Bibimbap* with Cheese...?!)
*Korean tradition cuisine, which is rice topped other toppings I think this one's gonna be my favorite hehe I can just feel it I got a feeling~
I feel it~ This one is lily fish cake soup! The word "Yuri" stands for lily in Japanese Lily, the flower! But then the word "lily" in Korean is a synonym of shellfish right? So I call it lily fish cake soup! Ooh it's hot~ My heart feels heavy... I'm only eating what you've prepared 😭😭😭 Yeri, you open this dumpling! 🎊Do an opening ceremony 🎊 (Crisp) Did you hear that?

(Q&A was paused due to eating) There's a Q&A section When you order food, Q. Do you order one menu and eat it all OR order several and eat little by little? First of all, I'm very interested in food so I try to order everything! You're already a perfect match with me - You too?

- It's spicy, isn't it? - (Enjoying the spiciness)
- You're dipping it in the sauce! You're not a spicy food amateur!! (Yeri's body language that's trying to say that it's spicy but tasty) I'm sweating right now, right? (I'll wipe it for you~) - Hey you're sweating!!

You said it's spicy haha It makes me sweat~ but it's so tasty Mmm~~ yeah but it's good Food is the most important factor that affects diet but It's impossible for us to not eat these (We cannot live without eating tasty food!!!) So-called 'Idol diet plans' are all lies, right? Yes actually (Girl group diet)
Half chicken breast, one egg, something like those! I don't even like those! But you get swollen if you eat something spicy or salty How do you take care of those? Fortunately, my face usually don't get swollen much but I think I get more swollen as I get older ..... What did you say!?💢 I'm not asking this because it is scripted or anything every time I look at you I always ask myself 'How is her face so slim?' Well you should be born with it🤷‍♀️ Hmm....lol What can I do? haha When I eat something like this and feel bloated You know the green tea bags, right? I put cold water in a cup and put some ice in it and infuse the green tea bag! After that I wash my face with it in a way as if it's face mask Then I can feel the swelling going away starting from here! (Slim face Yuri handing over the tips) I've heard this from somewhere They said if you infuse the green tea in the cold water and put sugar in it... (Words said it can relieve swelling)
(a.k.a. 'idol water') - I should try it!
- Try it when you're in a hurry~ (Yuri's cold green tea water face wash method, You can get rid of the swelling in 1 minute and 30 seconds~) By the way, this is so tasty... I don't want to talk (Ddu Ddu you have to talk...❤) Sis do you remember?? The time when you poked and pranked me in
