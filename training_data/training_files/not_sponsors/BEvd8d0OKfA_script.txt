head on over to wix.com slash go slash polyphonic to check it out today if it's December chances are you're sharing this pretty much daily with its cautious bouncy rhythm and twinkling melody Tchaikovsky Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy has become synonymous with Christmastime for many it's been used in everything from Fantasia to The Simpsons and been covered by everyone from Duke Ellington to pentatonix it's the kind of piece that's just become embedded in the Christmas season but what does it mean and how did it get so popular let's take a closer look [Music] the story of dance of the sugarplum fairy starts not with Tchaikovsky but with a man named August Mustafa Michele was a Parisian organ maker and in 1886 he invented an instrument known as a celesta though it was roughly the size and shape of an organ the celesta is actually quite a different instrument instead of pipes the celesta uses metal bars hammers connected to the keys hit these bars and create an unmistakable twinkling sound bright and magical in fact the name of the instrument even means heavenly so perhaps it's no surprise that in the centuries since its creation the celesta has been a go-to for composers who want to create something magical that's why John Williams turned to it when he wanted to score Hedwig's need the most iconic piece from the Harry Potter soundtrack long before Williams in 1891 Tchaikovsky took a trip to Paris while there he heard new cells instrument and was instantly enchanted he would write that the instrument had a divinely wonderful sound and he decided that he had to have one he encouraged his publisher to buy it for him and brought it to Russia where he kept it under wraps working on his music you see Tchaikovsky wanted to be the first to show off this wonderful instrument in Russia and he had the perfect piece to do just that he had been developing a ballet adaptation of the Nutcracker and the mouse cave a story originally written by ETA Hoffmann and then adapted by Alexandre Dumas set on Christmas Eve that story is about a young girl who is whisked away to a magical fantasy Kingdom by her toy nutcrackers in the ballet this fantasy journey takes up the second act and is represented by a number of dances based on sweets from around the world and the kingdom of sweets is ruled by the sugarplum fairy upon hearing the celesta Tchaikovsky knew that it's magical sound would be a perfect representation for his sugarplum fairy it was sweet in twinkling but had a mystical sound to it as well and with this sound Tchaikovsky was able to write a beautiful melody one that enchanted and enraptured capturing the innocence and charm of childish adventure [Music] and so in 1892 at st. Petersburg's Mariinsky theater Tchaikovsky debuted his work and showed the Celestra to the world and the results were mixed some praised it like we do today but many critics thought it was childish or foolish some were surprised to find that the great Tchaikovsky had scored this ballet thinking it an embarrassment in the catalogue of one of the greatest composers of the day so how did this go from an embarrassment to one of the most frequently performed ballets of all time it's hard to say exactly pieces of the ballet began to spread around Europe after the Russian Revolution when many dancers fled Russia they brought with them memories of their works including the Nutcracker and so some pieces saw her Foreman says here and there and you have to imagine that the dance of the sugarplum fairy was chief among these for many it's the most memorable part of the ballet the celesta melody is an instant earworm and then through one means or another the dance of the sugarplum fairy found its way into Disney's ears Disney animator art Babbitt made a scene around various selections from The Nutcracker ballet in the 1940 film Fantasia [Music] that movie was a roaring success bringing many classical pieces to the mainstream I once more and perhaps it's because of this renewed attention that choreographer George Balanchine decided to do his own staging of the Nutcracker in 1954 that staging was a massive hit in the United States but it featured a few key changes from the original most notably the leading roles in Balanchine's version are danced by children by providing choreography for children Balanchine made the Nutcracker the first piece that many aspiring ballerinas would dance when they were growing up from there it wasn't a stretch for the piece to become a holiday classic parents got to see their children dance in a magical whimsical ballet that was an easy fit to the Christmas season as annual Nutcracker performances became tradition the dance of the sugarplum fairy came more and more into the public eye while the entire Nutcracker is phenomenal and other pieces have become holiday season regulars Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy is the clear standout it captures so much of the magic of Christmas it's full of childish wonder and the slow bouncing steps seemed a perfect fit too creeping down the hallway early in the morning and spotting presents under the tree it was a long journey from an organ shop in Paris to ballet stages worldwide but the dance of the sugarplum fairy has become a Christmas classic for a good reason and chances are as long as snow continues to fall you'll hear the dance of the sugarplum fairy come Christmastime [Music] know that I sent you and to show your support for my channel [Music]
