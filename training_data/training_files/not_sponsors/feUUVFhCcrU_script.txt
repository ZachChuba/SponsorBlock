has been he put out his first mixtape when he was 16 but unlike similarly young rappers such as little pump and take hey who seemed to be nothing more than the subject of repeated in jokes Burrell was immediately recognized as a promising talent and he's only improved since then eight years and four albums later Earl Sweatshirt is considered a legendary figure in rap revered for his excellent songwriting and innovative musical style in this video I'm going to discuss Earl's influences his music and his surprisingly impactful presence in hip-hop let's get into it [Music] Earl Sweatshirt comes from a family of influential thinkers his mother is a professor of law at UCLA one of the top universities in the world his father was a South African poet and political activist known throughout the world for his influential work in bridging the gap between African poetry and black poetry in the United States Earl's parents separated when he was 8 years old something that would strongly influence the tone of his music to come Earl started rapping when he was in middle school under the name sly tendencies he released the first and only slide tendencies mixtape kitchen cutlery in 2009 shortly after dropping this kitchen cutlery mixtape Earl reached out to Tyler the Creator to express interest in Tyler's rapidly growing hip-hop collective future Tyler was impressed by Earl's music on MySpace and he invited him to join Odd Future the first Earl Sweatshirt mixtape came out around six months after Earl linked up with Odd Future it was mostly produced by Tyler and received widespread and received widespread critical acclaim the earl mixtape is a defining work in the classic Odd Future sound the lyrics are edgy the instrumentals are when were find and they combine to carry the spirit of confused adolescence that odd future was well known for Earl developed a cult following because his listeners liked that he was willing to talk about things that many people felt but few vocalized while the mixtape was ranked as one of the best albums of 2010 by complex Earl later called it unfocused saying that he was unable to make focused music when he was a kid just three months after he released the mixtape Earl's mother sent him to a boarding school in the Polynesian country of Samoa she did this because she thought Earl was going through a rough patch in his life and he needed to disconnect from the problems he was facing specific incidents leading up to this included cheating in school increasing reliance on weed and disrespectful behavior while Earl was stuck in Samoa he went through a sophisticated rehabilitation program aimed at otherwise capable young men experiencing emotional problems by that time he came back home LOD futures popularity had exploded largely due to the popularity of his mixtape they were suddenly playing sold-out shows across the country it wasn't what he had expected despite his inability to make music while he was there Earle speaks fondly of his time in Samoa he even talked to GQ about how his experiences there helped him grow away from the lyrical subject matter he was previously interested in Earl's first big release after his return to the US was his debut studio album Doris released in August of 2013 it debuted at number five on the Billboard Top 200 and was praised for excellent lyricism gritty production and great rapping features on Doris include lines from Tyler the Creator Mac Miller Vince staples Frank Ocean and RZA production was a collaborative effort as well Doris is dark brooding and moody but it doesn't feel like too much it's not one of those albums that's going to ruin your mood if you turn it on because above his ability to make a depressing song Earl's music is trimmed unlike much of modern rap it's not bloated and the years following Doris Earle became an underground rapper with mainstream popularity his music being strongly influenced by underground legends like MF DOOM Cam'ron he was able to take their relatively niche styles and turn them into something more of widely appealing Earl's second record dropped in the spring of 2015 after almost two years of relative silence it was a first plan to be called Knossos after a character from the novel been down so long it looks like up to me a classic from the 1960s counterculture movement Earle ultimately decided to go in a different direction with the title I don't like [ __ ] I don't go outside I don't like [ __ ] is stripped back even compared to the low five sound of Doris the album is shorter the lyrics are more belief the production is crushingly dark and minimalistic I don't like [ __ ] was no sophomore slump you can tell Earl spent a lot of time refining his production and songwriting with the album being entirely self-produced and somewhat lacking in features compared to Doris overall it was a successful album that solidified Earl's place is one of the most interesting rappers around lyrical subject matter examined Earl's mental health personal relationships and inner struggles just a few months after the release of Earl's second album Odd Future ended pretty much for good as the individual members solo careers have been taking off for a while preceding the official announcement it didn't exactly come as a surprise while many speculated that there was bad blood between Tyler and Earl because of this this turned out not to be the case Earl has been fairly quiet since 2015 he dropped a few singles on soundcloud in 2016 he played a few festivals per year but outside of that no one is really sure if he was going to make more music in June of 2018 Earl canceled a European tour due to depression and the shock of his father's death a few months earlier Earl also appeared on the Mac Miller celebration of life concert in late October 2018 pearls third album some rap songs dropped just a few weeks after Earl announced it it's his shortest record yet at just 24 minutes long some rap songs is wildly more experimental than Earl's previous work when it comes to production here he incorporates elements of avant-garde jazz trip-hop and more his flow and lyricism remain top-tier as always the album deals with the death of Earl's father politics family and mental health despite his brevity some rap songs has been praised as one of girl's best releases yet Earl Sweatshirt draws from his family's artistic background in a rich variety of musical influences to create something pretty unique in the current musical landscape not only is his music solid but earl has displayed the great strength of character being thrown into fame at the age of 16 and staying grounded through the whole ordeal Earl's music is refined deeply personal and never longer than it
