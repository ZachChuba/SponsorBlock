made this video possible Squarespace now you may be wondering why I'm dressed up like The Terminator with this jacket on well it's the best I could do to dress up like a cyber Punk because Tesla invited me to their brand-new pickup truck unveiling event we made it to the Tesla design studio we're about to go in and see the cyber truck unveil this was one of the most well hidden products ever there were absolutely no leaks nobody really knew exactly what to expect so I just got back to my hotel room after the Tesla cyber truck unveiling event which was a really interesting event I can't wait to get into it I get to get to hang out with a lot of cool people that I know from the Tesla community other Tesla youtubers Technic tubers as well it was just a fun time and the Tesla flower truck is a sight to see it's a really interesting product the world is addicted to oil but with my solution the truck so Elon came out this was one of the most excited I've been in a long time for any event we only knew things that Elon had tweeted about this truck in like teaser images and and in Elon was not lying he was not he was telling the truth he said is gonna be something out of a sci-fi movie they really built up the excitement and then they brought out the Tesla cyber truck and it's this very polarizing truck it doesn't even look like a truck and Elon has told us that it's not gonna look like a truck it's it's a triangular stainless steel skeleton of vehicle it's it's built it's it's built for utility but it's also built for performance actually the tagline right now on the Tesla cyber truck homepage is better utility than a truck with more performance than a sports car so when you first see this truck it looks really weird it looks strange to what compared to what we're used to as seeing in a typical pickup truck the thing that really throws me off is the triangular design of it I mean it really is a triangle so yeah it's made out of this exoskeleton stainless steel exterior it's really built for the zombie apocalypse I literally like when I see it I think it's like that would be the perfect vehicle to have during the zombie apocalypse they showed out you know fronds hitting a normal truck door and they showed him hitting this stainless steel the hard like cold rolled stainless steel of the Tesla cyber truck withstood the hit from this from the fledge hammer and they said that you know it's it's supposed to be able to be bulletproof as well and then of course they go into the Tesla armored glass which the glass is supposed to be way more durable than a normal glass on a normal car and they try to demonstrate that and I think they went a little over the top I think it was just a unplanned thing and you know Franz threw too hard I guess and then the balls actually did break the glass it didn't go through Elon did reiterate that multiple times but even after that the event still went on and this is an awesome truck as far as the pricing goes that's one thing that we did not know and it surprised me when it came out to be starting at 39 thousand dollars for the single motor version which has 250 miles of range and it also has a dual motor version that has 300 miles of range starting at 49,000 and then it goes to 69 thousand for the triple motor version that has five hundred miles of range which is awesome that is incredible I think they nailed it with these specs and the pricing so they're actually starting out $30,000 cheaper than their main competitor I guess in ribbing that's huge that's awesome I think a lot of people love that and they weren't expecting that and then the five hundred miles of range in the 69 thousand dollar version because you know with the ribbing I think it starts at 69 thousand but they only have four hundred miles of range so that's 100 miles of extra range plus you got the super charging network autopilot standard on all versions it also has a max towing capacity of 14,000 pounds which is more than anything that I can think of and what's also really awesome is that it has 110 and 220 volt outlets built to the truck so you can charge a variety of different things and they even showed the ATV that they built the driving up into the truck because it has that air suspension that adjustable air suspension drove right up into the truck bed and then plugged it in they played the electric ATV into the truck and it started charging so those outlets are huge that's a great benefit as well and then I also loved the rolling garage door of the bed I think it was really cool the way that the bed opened up and he kind of rolled into the inside I thought that was awesome and then so I got to write in it as well so I sat in the back and when I got in you know I was a quick ride but the main things that I noticed were the interior was very similar to the model 3 so it's very minimal very plain it has a similar touchscreen to the model 3 except this touchscreen is actually 2 inches bigger it's a 17 inch touchscreen and the rear view mirrors actually a rear view display which is one thing that changes new there's nothing that's not like anything else on other Tesla vehicles right now but when I was writing I noticed that the the view out of the windshield was incredible that whole panoramic a glass roof it was very spacious it felt very spacious there was there were three full-sized adults in the backseat and it felt just fine it can seat up to six the the middle seat in the front actually folds down to a seat as well so it can fit up to six people and then the back the bed looked very spacious it looks very roomy from what I could see out of the back window of course the zero to 60 is 2.9 seconds in the triple motor and the one the test ride we had was in the dual motor so it was it picked up I mean obviously the Tesla pickup is there it's on all vehicles it was fast it was quick the tires made it a little more bumpy my overall impressions of this truck is it looks different it looks weird it's gonna take some time to get used to I don't know how well it's gonna sell I actually put my deposit in for one because it's $100 fully refundable deposit so I was like why not you know but it's gonna be very interesting and you know when you see this in the ribbing next to each other I think nine times out of ten people are gonna choose the ribbing just based on the looks alone that being said this truck isn't coming out till another two years so by that time who knows maybe it's going to grow on people maybe it's going to be accepted maybe it's gonna be just more in the future I don't know but it's very futuristic but it does it does it has the specs the specs are there the price point is there I think they nailed it on the price point the specs they all they obviously built this truck to be just durable with the stainless steel and then all the outlets and all the the perks of what actually truck owners probably want in a truck without you know the traditional truck design I think you know if you if you lay the specs out on the table without even seeing the things and um you line it up to other other gasoline trucks just on paper alone late with the specs in the price point I think people are going to be drawn to the Tesla I mean it because they're all there it's just the the looks and the design are very polarizing they're gonna turn a lot of people off but maybe people will come around and maybe the price point is good enough because you know you don't have to pay for gas with a super charging network you know that is Tesla's biggest advantage right there I think Tesla super charging Network and their efficiency their battery efficiency I think those are the biggest pros for any Tesla vehicle so that was the Tesla cyber truck what did you think what are your thoughts let me know in the comments section below and finally I a free trial and 10% off your first purchase
