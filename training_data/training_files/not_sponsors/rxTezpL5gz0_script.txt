premium time we'll come back to this later in the years following the Treaty of Versailles the German Navy was a shadow of its former self restricted to a small number of largely outdated warships but after the Nazi seizure of power ambitions for the new creaks arenas surface fleet were scaled up to complement the Deutschland class Panzer shift commerce raiders construction began on a pair of battle cruisers the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz u-boat construction by contrast was given much lower billing despite the success of submarines in World War one only a single new boat was constructed in 1937 and six in 1938 this was despite the anglo-german naval agreement giving the crew sarena the ability to build submarine tonnage equivalent to 45% of the British this focus on the surface fleet was reinforced in 1938 with the formulation of plans ed devised by Admiral Erich Raeder the head of the crew Serena plans ebb was a fantasy wishlist for a fleet that would recreate Germany's high seas fleet from World War one it would comprise 10 battleships 15 panther chief commerce raiders 65 cruisers 8 aircraft carriers and almost as an afterthought 249 new boats such a fleet was to be completed by 1948 and used to defeat Britain's Navy that the British might themselves build new ships of their own to match the crews arena exactly as they had done the last time Germany embarked on the last building program does not seem to have been factored in Raiders focus on building a powerful surface fleet infuriated captain Carl Turner's the head of the crew serines new boat arm believing that submarines would be the decisive weapon in the war at sea duritz wanted a force of 300 u-boats constructed as an immediate priority to suffocate Britain's tray roots in the event of war but his requests fell on deaf ears and plans ed was adopted formally in January 1939 with its focus on capital ships first it came with the added stipulation from Hitler that the plan had to be completed three years sooner than planned in 1945 a demand that was completely at odds with the reality of Germany's shipbuilding capacity the very next month after approving plans heed Hitler told the rug out from underneath its by abrogating the anglo-german naval agreement in February 1939 Rader was aghast his nascent fleet was nowhere near ready to challenge the British Navy for control of the North Sea let alone the Atlantic as a result almost as soon as war was declared a handful of months later in September plans ed had to be scrapped the Greece arena was left with the collection of decent but dramatically outnumbered surface ships are very small u-boat arm and no coherent strategy in September 1939 Dermot's had no more than 46 new boats of which only 22 were suitable for service in the Atlantic this meant that with regular maintenance periods factored in only 7 could be deployed at any one time to britain's key shipping routes it was a very far cry from the armed martyr of submarine stirlitz had asked for without it he remarked that they would have to content ourselves with a series of pinpricks against british shipping not a decisive blow luckily for Duritz if there was one other organization in the world less well prepared to fight the Battle of the Atlantic it was the wrong Navy despite the influential role that u-boats had played in the First World War British policy in the interwar years was focused on limiting the capital ship construction of its rivals in particular that of Japan this was achieved by the Washington Naval Treaty in 1920 which limited Japan to 35% of the raw Navy's total tonnage the Admiralty was less concerned with the potential threat posed by submarines this was due to a measure of complacency after the comprehensive defeat of the u-boats in the first war and a huge amount of faith being placed in the devil as dicks own assets which began to be fitted to British escort ships in 1932 it was hoped that would sonar an air cover from aircraft carriers German u-boats could be aggressively hunted down and destroyed which would save having to expand the ships and Men escorting thousands of merchant ships in convoy as was done towards the end of World War one of much greater concern to the Admiralty were Germany's modern surface Raiders which it was feared we'll be able to strike with the impunity throughout the Atlantic being too fast to catch and too strong to destroy consequently a huge number of ships were deployed to counter just to pocket battleships in the autumn of 1939 by the end of the year both Raiders had been cleared from the Atlantic in the graph space sunk with just 12 merchant ships sunk by their hand a great success until you remember that 209 other merchant ships had also been sunk in the first three months of the war a hundred and ten of which were lost to u-boat the remainder being a combination of mines and the Luftwaffe in addition to the strikes on merchant ships the Royal Navy had also lost the aircraft carrier courageous and battleship Royal Oak both to u-boats and this was at a time when the crews really could only deploy a handful of submarines simultaneously it's not hard to imagine the level of damage that could have been done had done it had even a hundred-year but in 1939 let alone the 300 he desired reluctantly the British were forced to recognize that their strategy of offensive action was not working time and again ships responding to distress calls would find nothing but wreckage so as in the first world war the Admiralty began to implement organized convoys where merchant shipping would be accompanied by escorts capable of driving off any lurking submarines the only problem was that the raw Navy didn't have nearly enough escorts for the job in 1917 at the height of the u-boat threat in the first world war the Royal Navy had maintained 449 vessels for convoy escort in home waters by 1940 this number had fallen to a hundred and thirty-five this meant that Conn was Hathor say with inadequate escorts and we vulnerable to attacks by multiple u-boats despite this clear British vulnerability the Germans were slow to properly buy into making u-boat construction a priority Hitler still dreamed of a powerful surface fleet with the under construction Bismarck interprets at its center the quarries the RIA did present a plan in October 1939 to ramp up submarine production to 28 boats a month but this did not come to fruition you see such an increase in the u-boat force would inevitably deprive other parts of the German armed forces like the Luftwaffe of resources it needed to meet its own production plants and reichsmarschall Goering managed to lobby Hitler successfully to protect his own forces resources what resulted was the formal adoption of Raiders proposals but without the resources to make it a reality instead of 28 boats a month in the first six months of 1940 the Germans managed barely - only enough to replenish their losses opportunities to bring more firepower on Allied shipping were missed by contrast the British recognized the threat that u-boats posed and acted quickly to deal with their lack of escorts in the 1940 program 120 Corvettes and 80 new destroyers were ordered and 50 old destroys obtained from the United States as part of Lee destroys her bases agreements once merchantman were in convoy with better escorts the u-boats found it much harder to sink them even as they run riot amongst those ships still traveling and escorted of 992 ships sunk globally in 1940 only a hundred and one were in convoy on the main routes in and out of the British Isles this was a hundred and one sunk out of 17,000 882 merchant ships that made the journey that year a loss rate of just 0.6% both the Royal Navy increase arena planned the wrong kind of war at sea both navies seemed to think the heavy lifting would be done by surface ships a cat-and-mouse game between powerful German surface raiders and the allied navies but this wasn't the case the British overestimated the effectiveness of early war sonar and the Germans over estimated the utility of their pocket battleship Raiders just as Dermot's have been arguing the u-boats were by far the crease arenas most effective weapon while the surface Lee struggled really to make an impact in the Atlantic clans heed for all its grand visions was really a planner odds with reality the British still had a superior shipbuilding industry and would never have allowed the crease arena to match them in capital ships likewise the raw Navy's focus on maintaining a strong battle fleet in the interwar years had left it with more than a dozen mostly aging battleships and not nearly enough escort ships to counter even the handful of you birds that Derleth was deploying in 1939 but they soon realized their mistake and pushed s course of the very top of production priorities whereas the Germans hesitated continuing their pre-war habit of making decisions that were chaotic confused and sometimes outright contradictory and it's a good job they did because the damage that a fleet of the kind Admiral Dennis wanted could have done might have changed the entire course of the war before it had really even begun thank you - war aircraft as well as three days of premium time [Music] [Music]
