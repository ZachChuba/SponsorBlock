has gonna run this damn it man you know one thing about anime I really like where I guess the anime community that I really like is that we're really really balls deep in the meanie culture regardless of how you think anime means recently have decline in quality harv increased in stupidity I think it's safe to say that the majority of the International anime community online is pretty used to creating and distributing all sorts of memes and what do you get when you get someone who likes anime is creative and is also pretty good at meaning you get a theme called an abridged series there are plenty of anime abridges so many said that I probably can't even fit them all on this screen but if you are thinking of creating an anime abridged and there are mainly two things that you really need to be careful about one is obviously the jokes how you're going to parody fie the particular anime that you are abridging but I think secondly is the name of the abridged series it needs to be some kind of clever combination of the original anime that you are preaching and also a parody 5 version of that title that makes sense with how you want to deliver the abridge and the jokes within it what am I trying to say with all this well essentially I asked you guys over on Twitter the other day to take an anime series and ruin it completely by changing just one letter in its title enjoy the video listen I'm gonna be honest with you guys for just a quick second II I honestly wasn't gonna make a video on this particular tweet I just thought it was something fun and interactive that you guys can do over and Twitter about considering how much this tweet blow up and how many [ __ ] replies I got which were some of them were actually quite funny and hilarious I thought you know what [ __ ] it I'll make a video on this because you guys like dumb stuff this is YouTube this will get me views and well why did I decide to use that long-winded a breeched anime intro well all I'm saying is that if you are think it occurred in a bird series and you're like hmm I can't think of a clever or funny title then hey maybe you can draw some inspiration from the subjects of this video essentially what I'm saying is every answer here is free property for your next abridged series I don't know why I'm the one that's giving permission to use these when I didn't even make any it's probably best to ask the person actually submitted this tweet but basically I'm gonna go through some of the best answers and rate them from a scale of a to F without further ado let's go Salem own that definitely exists as as a pawn I mean didn't we have that Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball like x-rated parody I think was like seven Sailor Moon and the seven dragonballs or something like that I don't [ __ ] remember and I mean this one is just straight to the point and it's totally fitting that the fact that the lovely should be a couple also tweeted this out aka a former JAV actress which I actually interviewed the other day leads to that in description below I'll give that a J for JAV high school also known as a silent voice oh my god if anyone has the balls to try and abridge fi a silent voice which I don't know what insane human being would ever try to abridge a lovely and heartwarming film like that and there you go High School of the Deaf the people will think that they're gonna watch a high school of the dead parody when in actual fact it's a it's a silent voice parody I'll give that a C for cle-cle black butter mmm yeah it is uh the original series is definitely buttery in a you know in an in a not cool way I'll give that a T thirsty Black Butler fans no game no wife that's just life isn't it oh that's when you watch an anime and you can't peek best goal or there is no abisco it's just

buff dudes yeah I can I can get with that I'll give that ap for pip-boy water lemon Slayer mmm yes I was once a a lemon Slayer boy by that I mean in our backyard back in my parents place we used to have a lemon tree and I used to eat lemons like they were [ __ ] apples I still do that to this day if I see a lemon I just I just eat the whole thing like it's like it's a piece of orange like it's not you know about to destroy my insides hey don't judge r18 lemons is very nutritious yet very painful I'll give that aw for what's the rape scene in this series gonna be like hairy tale now that just sounds like can someone make a fairy tale furry porn parody that's what this would be hairy tail that just sounds [ __ ] gross it especially sounds gross because the only furry creature I can think of in fairy tale wood is happy and happy in a in an x-rated parody I'll give that a hater Helmer you're this like just triggers me bro if there is a tweet that perfectly symbolizes the goal of this video it's this one you have completely ruined an anime with that misspelling of your I don't know why I can imagine this being like the actual title I mean we have some weird [ __ ] English titles of Japanese shows and anime which is just like have you have you ever listened to an English speaker in your life I'll give this one and s4 sorry it's not the best drink I movie when you use

detective conan parody called detective conan where he actually [ __ ] sucks and becoming a detective i'll tell you why it's because the english channel for detective conan isn't detective conan it's [ __ ] case closed who the [ __ ] thought about name case closed really really really also the other reason why no one's made a parody of this is because detective conan is like a viking 2000 episodes

context please seven deadly sands I'll give that a T oh thanks I hate it what was again I change I asked you guys to ruin an anime do you guys understand English to be fair though there's probably a chapter or an episode of food Wars that I haven't seen yet which probably delves into like someone eating a food and then their legs and toes getting tingly or there's a whole foot Wars thing happening within themselves or if it hasn't then I'm sure the one out of the millions of food Wars doujins that have already been created has got to do something with fees something most likely with tentacles on your feet because no judging I guess I'll give that an F for foot fetishes are kind of weird fruit casket and then the reply to that is [Music] that's an F right there I'll give that a T for that ain't it chief dr. scone first of all I love that answer but second of all I am thoroughly impressed that the fact that you apparently have so much time in your hands that you can just sit in photoshop and photoshop a scone into cinco's hands like it was nothing somebody just needs to create a doctor Stone parody where the whole idea is for sanku to end up finding the secret formula to creating the perfect scone that he lost all those years ago I'll give you an end for now I'm hungry fake stain right and in another one unlimited blade dorks yeah wow you just perfectly described every fate fanboy and fangirl in existence a fake stain I doubt the fanboys and fangirls who think they know everything about history because they just watched a bunch of faith stuff and unlimited blade dogs as well it's pretty self-explanatory I'll give you an eye for it's not a roast because I'm one of them hood was also known as straight out of Compton or any gangster film that you can think of I'll give you a T for today was a good day polka mom oh my god first of all amazing title second of all I hope it is some kind of parody way instead of following Ash and Pikachu in his dumb ass it's just like a slice of life all the ashes mum that that actually sounds [ __ ] awesome not gonna lie because you get to see Ash's mom or like any of the moms blight the first three minutes of episode 1 of every new season give the mum some love again Pokemon company if you listening to this just just do it for us alright duel for the hardcore Pokemon fans the oh geez the gym one is if you will we get it we've seen all of the adventures that ash and Brock and Misty and every other you know replaceable ashes left and right hand character that we can possibly think of over the eight generations of Pokemon just [ __ ] all of that give us a slice of life of Pokemon and Ash's mom just leaving day to day just waiting the fact that she just let her ten-year-old son go out into the wall to fight an evil organization because that makes sense I'll give you when em hold milf power no Gabe no life I actually [ __ ] love this one because it's true Lord Gabe the man who gave us valve

beautiful arrow gaze and visual novels available now over on Steam I'll give you a w-4 weebs love gabe doctor stock not gonna lie i [ __ ] love the stones meme I don't know why I realized it's one of

give you an S for shouting out your own merch isn't selling out cocky star again a beautiful title for a parody dodging of lucky stuff not that I've ever read a dodging of luck you start because lucky star is one of those shows I feel that just in terms of the artwork is kind of at least for me impossible to beat my meat to but yeah if this has to exist this is definitely like some kind of NTR parody of lucky star and honestly I ain't cool with it personally but whatever floats your boat bro I'll give you an H for hard pass from me boy high schooled no gonna lie a theme this is my favorite walk I just love as well how you were committed enough to keep the two DS capitalized I'll give you just the simple D for daddy for that one you're lit in April you know what that sounds like that sounds like a mixtape that's some kind of like otaku rapper would create by creating beats out of like the classical music segments of your way in April actually that sounds [ __ ] amazing please someone do that I'll give you an M for my next mixtape yells at work also known as life I'll give you an A for adulting is hard for male archivist [Music] this is what I'm talking about this is the kind of [ __ ] that I was looking for when I tweeted this stuff out just stuff that makes me groan just imagining what this would be like again this has to exist like this this is definitely the prequel to Full Metal Alchemist brothel hood I'll give you an F fist ream or Die and you know what I should just I should just change the title of this challenge to change one letter to create a porn title because my god you horny [ __ ] are good at that right now I'll give you ad for dying at the end is pretty gruesome a silent noise well want some fun to say out loud what the [ __ ] silent you got you got it you're gonna make the noise quiet because it's a silent one it's a silent oh man I haven't said noice in so many years and I didn't expect to say it in this video that's for sure I'll give you an input bummer wars that can end up being one of two things I can either be just like a war that doesn't end up being anyway which you know sounds kind of boring but the more fun answer is like a Keijo parody where it's just like it's it's just cager bummer was is just caged oh it's just a war using your bomb but like instead of just like bumping each other with their bombs they just like that they hi firearms in their butts what am I saying I'll give you an eye for I guess I have too many weird ideas full fetal alchemist no no no I'll give you an H for hilarious but terrible and finally this last answer even though it didn't quite follow the rules and change to letters instead of one I appreciate this joke so much because it still managed to ruin the anime it still managed to fulfill the goal of the anime Borat oh we have a winner we have a winner ladies and gentlemen we have a winner this tweet right here this [ __ ] right here do you see it this is the winner but we're
