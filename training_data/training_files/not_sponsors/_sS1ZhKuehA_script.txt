[Mitchell]- If my math is correct, and
it is 'cause I have a mustache, it'll be about 18,752 pounds. - [Dan] This Tank? - Plus tax, yeah. - [Dan] And that's if that
tank was completely full of water, which it's about
half full of crushed garnet, water-logged crushed garnet
which is probably heavier and denser than water alone. - Yeah and it's not accounting
for the actual metal tank which has gotta be pretty heavy. - [Dan] Or the pump, or
the arm, or any of that stuff back there. - I'm guessing at least ten tons. - [Dan] And now we find
out how heavy the water jet stream is. And through the miracle of mathematics, we will figure out if this
water jet is truly 60,000 P.S.I. So we've got a standard bathroom
scale with a steel plate, the water jet will shoot
on that steel plate, it'll push down on it and
register some sort of reading here and then we'll use that
reading to figure out the P.S.I of the water jet. Okay, I'm slightly terrified, Craig. So have your hand on that red stop button. - Do you want the cut-proof glove? - [Dan] Yes. And if I scream then maybe stop it. - Just run if it's really bad. (all three laugh) (whooshing noise) - [Dan] So the first half
of that was just water and then about halfway through
we turned the garnet on, the abrasive, but it didn't look like that made a difference. We started out at 6
pounds and went up to... - Seventeen. - [Dan] Which means eleven pounds a push. - Eleven push pounds. A water jet weighs eleven pounds
incase you were wondering. Squarespace.com/WaterJet - [Dan] We're back and I
thought we would've had this figured out by now but... - I think we're making it
too complicated, I think... 60,000 P.S.I. and then
we've got 100 square inches so that's pounds per square inch. - [Dan] And when we're shooting
it on this we're spreading that 60,000 P.S.I. over the full area. - So 60,000 divided by 100
is 600 so I'm not saying it should weigh 600 pounds- the
data's telling us 11 pounds. - [Dan] Which is telling
us the water jet is like 11,000 P.S.I. is all? - Something like that. So either the water jet is 11,000 P.S.I. Or we're bad at math. And I'm thinking more
likely we're bad at math. (Dan laughs) - If anyone is good at math
and knows roughly how to get that- I don't even know
how to explain this, Dan. - [Dan] You just... do
like a square root, take the derivative and... - What about the hypothenuse? - [Dan] Yeah, you gotta
find the hypothenuse. - [Mitchell] The square
root of the rutabaga. - So if you're good at math
and you want to show us how bad we are at math, figure out
what the P.S.I. of our water jet is, put it in the comments
and we will pin what we think sounds right. Is our scale accurate? - I mean, I'm fat so yeah. (Dan laughs) - It says fat. - And I'll put all the numbers
and figures and all of our data down in the description
so you can use that. And now we just need to
cut this scale in half. (upbeat music) (whooshing noise) - [Dan] Is it a bathroom scale? - [Mitchell] Uh, I think so. The spring pulled itself apart. - [Dan] How does it work? Explain it. - [Mitchell] I don't know yet, man. I feel like we're missing some pieces. (Dan laughs) - [Dan] I'm pretty sure
that's all there was in there. So just use black magic or something? - [Mitchell] I was hoping to
see if that was filled with Bondo or something. I think it might be gypsy magic. It's got a spring back there... - [Dan] When you stand on it
it pushes something and then that something spins that
thing and then that thing tells you how heavy you are. - [Mitchell] I don't know
how this thing spins. - [Dan] You've got some
smaller springs that aren't attached to anything. - [Mitchell] Some sort
of a lever or something? - [Dan] Le-ver. Lever 2000 is that a soap? - Oh yeah bathroom scale that makes sense. - [Dan] Yeah. - [Mitchell] This spring
like pulls itself open... - [Dan] So now it's like a hole punch? - We could probably turn
it into a hole punch. Seriously though I've got
no idea how this works. Maybe we'll be smarter in our next video. - I wouldn't count on it. (upbeat music)
