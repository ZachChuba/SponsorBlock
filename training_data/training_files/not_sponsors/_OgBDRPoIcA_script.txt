this video is brought to you by Enzo the things I kind of threw myself on the kielbasa Leo do because a lot of times like you're thinking about like all these like Barry Lyndon and you think oh my god those fancy yeah [Music] what's going on Indy mogul my name is Ted came here with cinematographer me hi my Lamar is an amazing DP that's worked with not only Francis Ford Coppola but also Paul Thomas Anderson and most recently just shot the movie Jojo rabbit today we're gonna talk about the movie from not only the script but also break through the camera and lenses talk a little bit about the lighting and then finally also anything additional as far as stories on production and how it actually went from react so ready to do this now me high house experience of actually shooting Joe rabbit it was great he was awesome it's kind of all that I hoped for because I knew Tyga's terms a lot of people are coming it up comedy I think it's a love story what I want to ask first is what was the general aesthetic how did you guys arrive at the overall visual style for the film I watched for some documentaries and that had a lot of color footage from World War two as soon as I read like a script I thought about us like oh you know like that might be an interesting approach and seeing the sketches from the art department and samples from the costume department I we always kind of we were all going for the same idea of color saturation we are so used to black and white and then moving images from that era or like this naturally colored well yeah but like when when you watch like restored color footage from World War two you're like wait one second like everything is vibrant this is what the world actually looked like the idea that it's a story of a ten-year-old boy it was a really fascinating brain what's around he moves like rabbits and that's the way to go what's camera that this is being shot on what lens do you choose for the facility we chose the Alexius XDM and the reason for that like we knew that we don't want to get into any handheld when you know we wanted to try 133 166 25 to 400 so it felt like a really good system to to have work for all these four and the reason it's like the squarish sir he would have gone with with an L F or D Excel your Panavision would have a 2.0 start if you start with out with the wider one give me probably like a 2.0 then you have talked to crop too much to get one one three three the idea was that this is very close to one three three to start with near so you might not need to crop it all but I heard if you if you use the in every frame composers like okay there is a way to use the one point three lenses and start with a more square sensor and if you do that you'll get something very close to one point nine which is very close to one eight five yeah so you will end up shooting one eight five with anamorphic lenses but without a giant crop so what visual quality is that there is something to to the anamorphic lens is that velvety quality to the skin tone and the backgrounds are so amazing like okay everything there is like characteristic to turn on morphe so in this scene here we're looking for really what the quality of the anamorphic lenses in this aspect ratio and and you you would see like as soon as you see down the hall a single wall what's happening with that background the way it's like falls out of forgotten is like melting and sometimes when you rack focus you feel it unlike some people don't like that because it's too much I kind of like it that there's a certain like cinematic quality take gonna warp in yeah I start off first or the scene that I think capture that color now let's buy the clip the best way to describe the scene will be that judges coming for his revenge gotcha these are kids that voice gets he's coming back he's feeling empowered and ready to change something now Lance each of you will be given the opportunity to ignite and throw a grenade again we were in Prague and I was trying to figure out like okay we cannot bring a great tricks here but can I make one out of something that they had something very similar which was a bare-bones part yeah could take some weight and it worked really well and it allowed us to do the shot touch me a little bit but the lighting for the scene this was like an open field with a little bit of a forest so remember when we attack scouted we kind of chose it based on where the Sun is going then of course there was almost no Sun yeah until it came out and kind of like like this shot the white shot it was the first one we did in that location now the more we we went tighter and tighter like the light was not only changing direction the Sun was in and out of the clouds and then I came out where it's like the approach was smart because we started with the wide shots and kind of establishing the look we're like counting and trying to figure out like watching weather forecasts and all that I noticed that you know everyone's extremely kind of soft here - is there anything else that you added on top of the release one no no it's Matt the natural light that was pretty much natural maybe some haze anything else it was but I think it was we're trying to be careful with the haze and try to wear it more in the background like we kind of liked what happened after after we saw the first grenade exploding then we decided like we add some the background but we don't do it too much because otherwise it will kind of fights the the smoke that was coming from the actual so to make the smoke more noticeable you didn't want to add too much and a lot of times I will try not to delete anamorphic or vintage lenses they kind of do the same thing I tend to use haze only when I really see there light beams now you need to see but I love that I love this shot that shows so pretty symmetry and horizon symmetry and horizons all right moving on next scene all righty yeah what's going on the scene it's it's one of those moments between Jojo and his mother was like a really intimate dinner scene they have it's kind of funny you hate your country - much I love my country it's a war I hate it's pointless and stupid and the sooner we have peace the better out the war will end we will crush your enemies into dust and when they are destroyed we shall use the greatest one okay no more politics Dina is neutral grounds table is Switzerland let's eat so I mean we this was an easy one to to think about because we knew that they will spend most of the time sitting at the table we came up with two lighting setups for him for this and there's one light that I I I love especially for people sitting at the table it's the shimmer a pancake and I mean the advantage of that is that you can put really flat to the ceiling but also the quality of it it's so much better than like a gin ball or anything it was easy we know we want to start with a wide shot so yeah and we really had this this amazing chandelier we actually had to sky panels as sturdy him one here and one here and there were like crisscross they had shimmer oz men egg crates so they don't spill anywhere else and what's amazing about about shooting Alexa is that you don't need a lot of feel right all the feel like that wasn't the scene was pretty much coming from the practicals and that's because the dynamic range of the cameras being involved how much it's easing the shadows yeah if you look at it you have a harder edge light on both of them in the white chart mm-hmm when we went into coverage you turn off all these guys and we came with a shimmery your own assistant aha and if you look at the close-ups there's a much softer lighting on them which is nice yeah closer but you can get you can get away with it what's interesting about like we knew that that's what we we want to use for the close-ups so that's when we matched our s 30s or sky panels to the time because when you dim down these tungsten lights they generally warm up and color temperature so they naturally give you that 2100 we did and of course because I love Dida lights we have also a deed all that was like right outside of the shop yeah just mashing into the white clothes yeah table I think sometimes he was behind the scene sometimes yeah because if you use the optical adapter like you can yeah you can do like it will create some nice eye light when she was looking down that would be you know and for him as well like it's an extra feel like that you might need it when it came to composing this scene how did you approach the composition for it the main discussion was like do we want to go over the shoulder and then it felt more intimate to just cut from from one site to another without being over the shoulder my question is this scene in particular is one where this is a comedy and the the lighting is this very cinematic kick sure he's got traditionally cinematic so I think a lot of people a lot of indie filmmakers here like a comedy comedy comedy should tie key all the time that's fly lighting all this stuff what do you say to that and now why did you go with this approach it's it's I think if you overdo it either way it's not okay you know it's like if it's a dinner scene at night then you can afford to do this and still have the comedy right I mean like we could have been way darker but we we still kept some light on the walls in the background a lot of times when you're going over your location I think the best approach would be to either turn on the lights they're there or turn off everything and kind of see how the space looks in me for real I think in this wide shot it really does feel like the light is really just bouncing off of this wall from the chandelier or maybe from this little light here and then because the room extends out this way that's what that fall-off of the light comes from so it's it feels motivated by our time our SUNY well it's a really nice gentle year and they're really light to the fact that the bottom of it was frosting so before we move on episode and now let's go back to the episode this scene we see Rosie and I'll sign the hiding space it's an interesting another interesting intimate moment between them he's different he suspects something he thinks in girl's clothes disappear you remind me of her you really into I would love to have seen her grow into a woman but other live do what you understand that basic it's supposed to be a tiny attic space so we didn't want to over build it but also like wanted to have enough room for for them to interact us interact and stay there somehow okay tend to to to like certain tools then Vantage has a set of t1 so my first conversation with Tiger I was like okay what do you think the lighting source would be for for those scenes would she have or like a petrol lamp so we went for the idea of the of the petrol lamp yeah then of course like in my mind is like t1 yeah in theories like yeah okay let's go for it so our key light in this scene like if you go to the white shot the potential lamp clear top left okay that's the key right is that the actual light yeah that's actually lighting them yeah are you kidding that's the t1 the tricky part with those Petron labs is that if you want a bigger flame you get more light of it but it smokes the glass very fast yeah once every 10 minutes you have to clean the glass so it's like okay we're gonna keep it so it will give us the level of exposure and then we had a really tiny LED tube yeah for some feel light and a little to what it's probably good to quasar something no you're like you know or handmade think out of them yeah and it had to be deemed down quite a lot now the down part of this and it's like you should look at it especially for this scene I tested on these three lenses and we realized that some of them weren't resolving up to 1.8 so there was a fair amount of sharpness that we had to do for this scene did you shoot all these close-ups wide open - yeah yeah but that's nothing like the 9303 Cote point TT one you're actually resolving that 11.24 the ones then you have to go to 1.6 or if you had to leave it wide open just a little bit of postage sharpening gotta fix down which is like sometimes you do just the eyes yeah better trees like if you do our an overall sharpening that's right for these close-ups I mean there's they they move a little bit and if you're shooting winery so this was the other like the bedroom and we actually had here door here and we're talking about like when this would happen nothing like no other practical will be on so the only thing would be probably no no I just I just asked I found out here like an s60 widow she for this shot for scarlet for example we actually end up we were here we actually took this lamb and moved it here so we had like an edge light on instead of it being here to flat flat and front lead we just move the wrong he just moved it around will certain lights worse what I think there's so many times where MVPs will look at it and be like I can't mess with continuity I have to leave this lamp here which means that her singles gonna look great but her single is gonna look kind of dumpy but you're saying you don't have to compromise you can like trust that you can you can you can't get cheated and that the audience will go along with a trained actor er uh some of the episode yeah alrighty the last and final singing you're anywhere this year we do this is the end of the water scene where Joe just ranked desperate wrangled place too high [Music] [Music] what's going on in the shop it's it took a while I mean I think it took us five or six takes to get it right it was such an interesting location and we wanted to do so much more to you this was an abandoned Factory we we talked about this shot and he was maybe we do it in one shot and then I tend to like all these crazy ideas and then I was like okay now now how are we gonna do that because in theory like the easiest and if you have the budget you just bring the technical in here and you just like go 1000 you just tell skill back the entire way tell us go back you can bring down the price that there was no way we can feed a tech mother from this one I had to use actually two more teachers because number one positioned the camera was too high up it was darling this way and when Jojo was jumping into the hole there number two it was too low so then the hardest was to just boom in the same time I just he was jumped you gotta follow gravity and on top of all that you had four five explosions there's one and the crazy part is that the reset because of the explosion was taking like 25 30 minutes I think right take two I almost lost hope bite takes Rios like oh oh it's kind of talked about the lighting so first thing like this we're adding him you know it wasn't too much and actually we had a little bit of a Sun I think we had only two counters on this side and I think it was one AeroMax here and one m90 here see those lights on so that but yeah that's a nine t is creating those beams of light there he was one of those days where the Sun was in and out so I think we had our our lights just in case the Sun goes out and the only thing that they would do they would probably be just lighting the small corner it was a pretty pretty big here's anymore just like kind of backlighting side lighting that smell great yeah pretty much like especially for the big explosion yeah I'll see that like you just get a little more texture just see she says not falling some clerk knows huh and I think we had another two lights really inside these rooms like really high up pointing straight down I think they were like a just s 60s yeah on a polecat in both rooms it was pretty interesting because we kept working on it and Tigers running to the second unit and I was like kind of running into Jesus but it was when we finally got it was like yes thank you so much for joining us we had this was amazing we signed you signed the also thanks again link down below along with links to the podcast discussion with me hi doesn't you that want to learn more about his journey becoming some photographer awesome so those are upset with me hey Mel Amar'e on Jojo rabbit amazing cinematography seriously really really good working on this thanks so much for watching this guy so of course this is any money so what did it cost begged Ben for a hug anamorphic lens I mean it wasn't any just effect that you had to bring them from another country like Germany and there was like no no you could forget about it but about we never really I mean we're like just like watching photos in magazines with like Panavision or no more she cannot even dream about those you know it's like but our dreamers are for one day I wish I can use the hoax
