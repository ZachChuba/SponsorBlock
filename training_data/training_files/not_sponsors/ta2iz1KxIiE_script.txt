hello good evening and welcome to our vampire the masquerade Chronicle la by night tonight is season 2 episode 7 red flags let's meet our vampires I'm Alexander ward and I played Jasper I'm Erika you she and I play Annabelle I'm Cynthia Murray and I play Nellie gee I'm B Dave Walter as I play Victor temple and it's been a hard week and I'm your storyteller Jason Carl before we get started we're gonna thank dog might the master craftspeople who bring us our beautiful dice boxes with the clan symbols on them to hide your hunger from the world and our fantastic custom storytellers screen emblazoned with both the N arcing camera love symbols I couldn't imagine why that would be maybe it's because in last week's episode we saw some pretty powerful undead politics happening the vampire an arc leaders of Los Angeles so let's recap that action now with a rat side view of it courtesy of Ramona's sketchbook holy [ __ ] what's more fun than a baron in a crappy mood four barons in an even crappier mood the bosses all met to have a little bitty Chitty chat about the camerea and made a plan to push back and hey gotta hand it to you Dom I didn't think that would work never thought you'd get close enough to check it out but you never even looked under the sofa genius never seen the big three all together in one place before Nine's Rodriguez Isaac Abraham's and Therese Foreman and of course our uber undead Victor temple the newest baron or is he seems the big three are not happy with his shenanigans and decided to teach him a lesson meet the new newest baron Fiona looking sharp too she's helped herself to a big slice of the vampire Valley pie some of Victor's turf is now hers and the big three give her the big thumbs up no way this ends well but they've all got bigger fish to fry for now and that brings us to nines the vamp the legend we used to hang out but he doesn't leave his turf much these nights and we've all been a little busy right guys Nine's made it clear he won't be the leader of the anti camerea task force they're all cooking up but baby bee yeah he saw what we all saw the real deal the spark the fire she's gonna talk to the other licks bring him on board rile him up fan the flames I just hope she doesn't get burned [Music] Thank You Megan Jessup for those wonderful sketches from the sketchbook of Ramona we're gonna thank someone else other fun Backblaze stuff as the episodes continue so what part where our will our code we play in the upcoming conflict with amarilla we'll find out now as we tell a vampire story [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] this morning most of the mortal population of Los Angeles woke up to thoughts of work or school or maybe going back to sleep for a little while they thought about what's half a breakfast how to get that raise they know they deserve where they'll get the money to pay their rent this month but not you maybe you did dream in the day sleep maybe you passed a day completely calm ATO's but after the Sun sinks below the horizon and dark rises you woke two very different thoughts thoughts about the danger in the night around you the risk that you've undertaken the mystery that has confronted you and the hunger always the hunger each of you has been active in the last two nights doing various things to contribute to the missions you've agreed to undertake in the name of the Anarch movement tonight you're gathered club maharaja once again under the safety a victory security team how will you proceed from here actually you need to make a phone call fear ins that keeps a pretty tight schedule i message her to a message via Renza is now still good long moment passes and the text message reply is yes so I do do this in front of all of them but I do not put it on speakerphone so you're calling Fiorenza yes and they will hear your side of the conversation yes very well and I do call her Victor my boy always a delight to hear from you how are you keeping it has been a week fear Enzo indeed I guess we're used to them coming after us all the time but I gotta tell you I wasn't used to it being some of the ones that I thought we're looking out for my best interests it makes you think maybe there really is no one in this world we can count on the thought has crossed my mind from time to time my boy could it be that you are dissatisfied in your current loyalties wouldn't go that far but if they expect me to live under Fiat law if they expect me to just do what I'm told and get in line and accept what they say then what does it even mean to be unbound a sentiment echoed by many of my colleagues in the ivory tower I confess I do not understand your choice in this matter but as you know the door home is not yet closed I don't know what's gonna happen in Los Angeles but I don't want us killing each other in the streets you may find this is inevitable well I'll think about what you've said as always but um before you go yes ma'am my associate mr. price informs me that Miss G may be having similar doubts is this true you know over these last night's we haven't had a chance to talk I'll speak with her later hmm one thing though I really could use some help here is the business in Chicago concluded mmm like I said there's so few I can count on I shall take it under advisement you shall hear some news of this before the week is out my boy as always I appreciate your counsel fearin so anything you think about how I should proceed I will always take quite seriously I daresay you'll be the first to know thank you ma'am good night the line goes dead so that balls rolling who is that mm-hmm Oh a very powerful event true she's very plugged in to the camera Ella we came up kind of along the same time she was very influential in the mortal world and has quickly become very fluent influential in the kindred world too but we kind of learned the ropes became friends all about the same time more or less she a narc - oh no viren's is the furthest thing from it but then true usually have more in common than we don't but the reason why I did this whole little display is I had to plant the seed that I'm dissatisfied hopefully get phone to ring I can't just say please let us come talk to you because they'll sense a trap of course I need them to invite us okay balls rolling got it so that was the invitation to Elysium well it hasn't come just yet but I think if I read the conversation correctly it's probably coming unless you found a way to open that particular door I have a few ways of opening that door but it seems like that that's probably a better opportunity what I have is Intel as to what Vannevar might be thinking please share well so the Rose Garden is also quite small and everybody loves to talk about gossip in politics well see you'll learn something in the camerea that everybody talks rumors and a politic that's how you climb up the social ivory tower it's obnoxious yes anyhow I keep in contact or somewhat keep in contact with some of the rose petals and three of them actually kind of gave me some information so there's this obnoxious little pixie [ __ ] named Paulina who seems to think that she's better than me hardly Aires what he means that everybody in the camera Ella always thinks that they're better than the other people right that's that's yeah that's what I took from it yeah good tape at any rate um Vannevar doesn't take us seriously that's fair we don't take us no us the eunuchs us as a valley coterie doesn't take us seriously doesn't think that we're a threat which is actually quite good good even after this year I curate even after the sheriff no cuz I was inspired work in fact he thinks that you're quite a good fighter at least that's the word amongst the cam hmm at any rate they've also admitted that it's a complete and utter trap something that we've all talked about already well at least they're probably being honest or they are instruments of the trap yeah but it's made us a laughingstock of the Elysium so that's something we get to walk into I mean this is another one of those times that why do we give a [ __ ] what they think in the Elysium but okay well you should give a [ __ ] because a few of them may have moved in on your turf to live in the valley I heard about some toreador in the valley yeah yeah that's a daddy I know so do we do anything about that I always suggest to keeping our surveillance yeah they could be an ally could be Miranda our old friend let me know that she did it doesn't that to all of us it's me she tipped me off about the toreador and asked what I wanted to do and I said let's just keep eyes on them it might be good to know their comings and goings you know maybe we can make friends with them if not maybe they can be useful pieces and whatever we're about to do next yep is that this Paulina is she in the valley no she'd not be caught dead in the valleys he hurt no no she's in Beverly Hills Beverly Glen I'm sorry Beverly Glen yeah something to keep an eye on and so one thing that I actually got some very interesting intel on which I didn't think it's a very trustworthy source but this guy named Rex total pretty boy hotshot Oh I'm not quite sure I trust him however he did say something along the lines of Vannevar plans to make an example of you I mean apparently he can join the club I think everybody thinks they can make their buttons against me yeah but see the difference is Vannevar has to keep his word right now because he's in a really bad shape yeah I mean that makes sense he gets to tell everybody we don't matter he gets to tell everybody it's no big deal but then if he has to make good on it up starts killing his Sheriff it's got to do something mm-hmm yeah well I mean I'm walking into that meeting an example well the way the camera works is Elysium really is sacred ground and it leasts up until recently they took that stuff very seriously still do so it's possible he'll hit us before it's possible he'll hit us after no no there's safe passage going and coming yes going and coming he doesn't mean the day later they won't hit us precisely right so as we're out of the door yeah we get all the way home and in our house clothes yeah basically so but theoretically in Elysium we're actually probably in one of the safest places maybe probably they could go all red wedding on us I don't know like they're not making sense anymore red wedding who would have a red wedding no it's it's notes that show like I mean I actually read the books like Victoria gave me such a hard time of it you know what never mind it's it's inconsequential yeah I mean I read it when it came out it's cool pretty like you watched it though sure which would you prefer you know what hang on we'll talk about it more later okay right right right I'm ready for that story to be over let me tell you that but either way theoretically we're safe in the Elysium did they write about cam life it's a lot like that actually it sounds like yeah actually yeah but with Dragons yeah no it's yeah dragons yeah yeah why didn't I think of this in the first place when I try and explain it all day it's like freaking Game of Thrones that's what it's like that wouldn't ya know I get a I have a cultural touchstone for this now great thank you great witless dragons yeah what about you you I know you were hanging out with nines he was cool man nines is really really cool yeah he no I just I feel like I have so much to learn from him but actually what I was thinking about I know we got really distracted with the whole political situation on hand but what about the ghosts I mean I thought that was that I mean the one guy dissipated you told me petronella I asked her to leave the guy alone and [ __ ] yeah but but something weird is going on in Griffith and something it's like we sort of dealt with some of the symptoms which was a hot a haunting yeah but there was still a skeleton in that basement and Ava said there's something weird underground First Nations people that were there and right yeah well you know last time I tried to ask ever about it apparently that made me the jerk so that's why it brought it up again um what do you think I think it's worth looking into I haven't heard anything from petronella at all well I assume your sister is okay seeing as I got this back yes yes she's she's fine she's um she's on an early spring break oh yeah she's probably good to not be around yeah so I don't know I feel like there's something there and that's still not not our territory it's not something's going down around Griffith and I feel like whatever it is could somehow somehow be connected with all of this recent activity with the Kindred in LA all right wait wait hold on idea so as our appointed a revolutionary leader long may she reign how would you go about the situation what do you think we should do well we were kind of in the heat at the moment there but Ava seems like she had more information on it also the sisters I bet would know something what do you suggest which one talk to the sisters this seems like good it seems like something they might be able to shed light on I mean it kind of steps on your front doorstep man I mean are you okay with us letting them know hmm have I anybody know this is why I'm trying to be better Jasper this is me to get consent Olive Branch I have hands to bring an expert there at some point but I don't particularly think that is an immediate problem okay not that it may not be a problem I mean your your house dude I mean I do agree that while it is something weird that we need to figure out it is probably less imminent I kind of put the ghost in Fiona in the same box there are problems that need solving they just not the problems that need solving mixed again I really feel like somebody could make a killing in vampire therapy you know there used to be some that did that kind of thing they had like a third eye and everything it's weird but I've seen any of them in like a long time well in the interim an interest of what you've brought up Jasper will your home be okay or do you need some assistance warding things off not that I can help in that situation but family we know people I'm sure it'll be fine did you ever figure out who that guy down there is that nice for a tune it's in like mom jeans from the 80s like what is deal it's no all right okay speaking of guys there who are the people above the other night oh I think I think they were just paparazzi you remember like way back maharajah the night they came and hit us at the club there was a reporter there sniffing around and I sort of did my thing and got rid of him I mean it was that guy that guy back again you know so I agreed to do an interview when he left are you all right we mean you look terrible mm-hmm as you mentioned this I appreciate that getting a style pointers from a room full of corpses that's cool uh no I guess I'm not all right this has been a pretty rough couple of days but I guess maybe I haven't been sleeping well which is weird because we don't sleep as such but I don't I don't know wait is the ghost here can you see anything no I don't think so should I roll for something you want to try yes I've been keeping an eye on the guys nothing we're walking weird so since the unseen mm-hmm okay let's make it let's make it what's an investigation not great this is one of those things where since you mentioned it maybe like it came is it like freaking be able to swear we just talked about it uh two successive two successes hmm see no spirits no specters no ghosts where are you looking around room so you know I saw flickering lights so you look up yeah mm-hmm Wow don't need the supernatural eyesight to see the rat so mm-hmm Annabelle this thing is your now our only hope have you put any thought into it yeah I think that we really do need to make an effort to reach out to all the Kindred was locally and outside of our territory yeah and the people that feel disenfranchised looked over the people that could be potential allies right how do you propose we go about doing that you're one person well it's gonna take quite a while for you to go talk to everybody yeah I figured don't let everybody else hang out with their clans or their coteries and can't we send out emissaries the way that I mean jazz is doing the doing the thing oh yeah I mean if you just want to put the word out we can put the word out I mean you know the nines talked about how McNeal went door-to-door you know shaking hands but I mean in 1914 or whatever there's probably 20 of us you know it's a little harder now but we could do it yeah we could do it I mean it seems like the thin Bloods they have some sort of network and you know a lot of people yeah those like knots rot or everywhere man they got a no I'm sure they do where are they they're around yeah like okay I can take you to them if you want yes some of them not all of them they mean there's a lot of them but I can take you to some of them yeah yeah let's let's do that yeah wait hang on beware though that's not actually that bad we just have to go underneath Hollywood forever Anderson underneath Hollywood Forever of course that's where they are you know I said bruja come on not for a - and Hollywood Forever Cemetery yes that's so God it is it is it is very own brand it's very hungry and yeah yeah do you want to explain the nuts for a to thing to her should i what thank Victor please explain to me what you mean by the Nosferatu thing no again I explained the venn true thing I think she's saying the venturi thing but yeah do I explain that that's what you think you can explain the venturi thing if you want hang on you tell me tell me if I'm wrong there pretty much everywhere huh they pretty much know everything I've seen maybe two in our time well but more than two have seen us though I guarantee it and you can buy almost anything from them if the price is right and they tend to all have us something going on here is I mean anywhere an accurate representation it's they act as kind of information sellers if you have what they want they can get you what you want generally speaking but what you have to pay may not be worth what you're asking that depends on who you talk to and what they want at the time okay something's is anybody they see the thing is I wouldn't know and even if there were unless I was better at it than they were there's every possibility that I'm not better at it than they are you remember me complaining about us being like nocturnal predators without night vision they can turn invisible without being able to see invisibility cool cool cool remember how I was really freaked out about the rats yeah team through the rats mmm yeah okay the fact that maybe at any moment there could be nos brought to around that's not something you all felt was oh you've seen me do it a million times you saw Nick do it in this very place I didn't know that there were any other like a bunch of not Nosferatu around I just I thought like that he was the only one I was special in some sweet you are sir you are special but yeah like I thought you might have been one of maybe two and no really yeah everywhere wait Hollywood forever I'm thinking Forest Lawn I was like there in the valley but they're not available again they're not not in the belly yeah okay and well weld you guys would happen yeah please sorry he's fine with us being there we're not we're just not fine with him at the moment as far as I understand it I feel like that is an accurate accounting of events I will say I have radically stepped up the timetable of our move to the valley I've even put in some offers on some places so we might be able to get out of here sooner than later this is not as safe as I thought I will say one thing if I am to take all three of you down there please be polite not all of them are is willing to look over comments as I am and a lot of them are much more concerned about their appearance than I am and I want to explain something to you Annabelle because it's going to get confusing if you don't already know some of them are going to look like there's anything wrong with them doesn't mean there's not well they're just going to look like a fine is that part of your yeah not something I particularly can do but they live under a cemetery they're not royalty Q I'm still learning no no some of them might think they are you be nice don't you adore ya right thank be you be less you Wow yeah I love you but maybe less there may be wear appropriate shoes oh yeah no suits that yeah I'm gonna not what do you mean appropriate here close toed close toed shoes with some sort of maybe rubber sole I'm generally have rubber sole that you can afford to lose at some dog boots of some sort flat will find so I'll get some Chuck Taylors around here that I'm sure will fit you it'll be fine I don't wear Chuck Taylors Doc Marten I mean I have those we'll think of something hey I will tell you this though kind of the standard talk that I did I give you though you know bill what was that I don't really what was that ITEX Campbell I'm all like eyes on the cameras is everything all right one moment sir comes the text reply no what I don't do the ghost thing like what I don't see anything your phone rings a few moments later it is Campbell's number I actually put him on speakerphone I'm like yea Campbell sir yes there's a utility crew working on some lines around the corner on our block looks like some intermittent outages maybe they see a little bit should we check it out keep eyes on them cuz it's late so when I didn't see any it's weird for it's a weird it's an odd hour for standard maintenance mm-hmm I don't know sure keep eyes on him please yes sir absolutely sir hang up I was just going to say you've seen what Jasper can do you've seen what Nick can do some of the nosferatu are very very powerful and very very strong if they even though we're probably being somewhat welcomed if they don't want us to leave we are not going to it's good okay so yeah don't make I never make comments about how they look I was just a blanket statement I wasn't directly some of them may not look like Nosferatu they could be anywhere at any time they may know things about all of us no they do they do know our secrets some of them be you listen I don't work the same way a lot of them do I don't really trade in that many secrets it's not how I live whatever this is but a lot of them that's all they care about is secrets so they're gonna be different than me just you know buddy fine yeah something that maybe they were actually some of the first hackers were nos ferrata like information technology they pioneered a lot of that stuff yeah yeah I did do anything on a computer when you're hiding underground hey wait a second how is it that you're like a part of like the Greater Metro Nosferatu community I thought you like woke up alone and didn't like know anything like did they find you you find them like what even and I have been around a lie for five years I've done some investigation I also talked to some people and found out I didn't just stumble onto everything I did get someone finally to teach me some of what I am everyone should and there are others so how soon can you hook this up I'm sure we can go there tonight I don't make a call okay okay yeah yeah no I I'm gonna little not this but don't know but don't like not too understated because then you'll insult them I'm just gonna send a message are you going to send a text message on your flip phone yes mmm what is the message would it be alright if I stopped by with some friends it takes a few moments for the reply to come back for for dinner yeah thank you Victor your phone rings it is Campbell again speakerphone again yes sir I just wanted to let you know I put in a call to the utility company they do have a crew on our block working apparently traffic signals being replaced or mmm they're not sure what the cause of the malfunction and the light is could be computer problems it could be a Fault in the in the lines but as far as I can tell it's legitimate all right maybe just keep one person just in case uh we can spare it's been quiet sir so I'm sure I can spread the metagame which reminds me sir should I put the should I put the detail back on your son what do you mean back on my son I mean um I mean we pulled him off when you said all hands on deck when when everybody went on lockdown we needed everybody we couldn't staff around the clock without him wait hang on what do you mean a Campbell if I said everything is so dangerous that we couldn't leave and we had to be protected why would you think that my when did you most vulnerable child that would I would not want somebody on them that means put more people on them what the hell man I'm sorry sir you said to bring everybody have you been off of work um about maybe six nights Campbell find him yes sir I'm so I'm so sorry sir I thought you meant this I never mean leave the kids unprotected wait what about and I take him off speakerphone and I'm like what about the other people you still have eyes on them yes well do you mean the other other person yes I do know I brought in everybody sir Jesus [ __ ] Kimball find them all now yes sir right away and I hang up when's the last time you talked to mark I need to make a note I have been keeping tabs on him and I've been following him okay I've been I just I just wanted to see him get in and he's dropped out of school he's going out at night just at night and and the group's planning something I don't I don't know what I don't know they didn't he's just been meeting with them in ones and in like pairs and groups of three and small stuff but they're planning something I don't know what and I mean he's he's alive alive okay all right so eating and okay like go to the bathroom well it was since you're telling me that you've had eyes on mark I feel the need to tell you I also had people in Illinois I just wanted to make sure she was okay apparently when Campbell pulled eyes off a Mark II pulled eyes off for her too I don't know if you want to make sure that she's okay - I just I wanted to make sure they were all okay I had him out of sight I don't even know if they had tails but now I don't know I don't know you you just found out when I found out that they've had no one on them Jesus I had people protecting her that's the simplest way to hurt either of us is to hurt them I told you I had it handled I know what you said it I don't I'm not trying to interfere in your business I don't know if you've been in touch with her or not but whatever protection I had on her apparently hasn't been on that's all I know or but I sent him out I just need they're gonna they're gonna pick them both back up at least eyes on them they're not gonna pick them up they're gonna put eyes back on I do text a do text Ramona I say my eyes on mark and Elinor got pulled can you check please Jax comes back that house be pissed me too just check please stand by no I check the playlist check the playlist what there is a song on the playlist song is red flags and long nights but she wants revenge do you have a response um I put on in the next room by the Neon Trees song of love and attraction and devotion and need I have made it note I would also like to text mark I just say hey it's dad I know it's been a minute but I'm gonna be in the area tomorrow night maybe we can get together my reply comes back in less than 30 seconds I'm busy I just look at the phone and I say Mark's probably fine but we'll know for sure yeah and it sounds like something he'd say that all right my people will find him it's it's that's the problem all right there's another one those lessons you know that whole like blood bond thing they take things very literally so of course I should have known when Campbell thought he was protecting me that men do nothing else Paley you have to spell it out that's you know sorry you your your thing when do we need to move there's nothing we can do about that now but are you did you I asked Ramona to look around to the right back we'll find them I'm gonna go get dressed upstairs to the mm-hmm closet mm-hmm the office yeah you have some spare clothing yes I appreciate but I say it's over I handled it it's fine she's gotta trust me on this okay you saying you want me to pull the people of Illinois because I'll do it you know this game now yes with all of this Vannevar has got to make an example are you absolutely sure yes I do Tex Campbell no eyes on Illinois but I don't Tex Ramona say it's done I pull my people off of them Campbell's text reply is affirmative sir and I have made another no you got to know though this revolution this war this coterie whatever everybody is always going to be looking to hit our soft targets and it doesn't get much softer than the two of them trying yeah but you just forget something like that I have a new life now I have a new family a new purpose but it's hard it's been less than two months the blood tears that fall from Annabelle's eyes are scenting the room with vampire vitae is anyone above hunger tube number 303 like you to make a check of your unmarked willpower one success with one success it takes everything you have not to give in did that taste that smell because you know what it is do I notice this are you okay taste it I'm fine I actually move in between moving between the two of them you know you want to you saved her from me once but it's fine you're wiping the tears away yeah hmm it takes a moment with the scent palates are no longer itching I hate everything figured out I thought I had the rest of my life figured out and in a way I guess I did Anabelle your phone beeps text message from Ramona it's all cool stay on target back at you baby B I you know I hate that I know I keep my eyes on Jasper because I realize he's only got so much control over this but I'm speaking to you and I say this hitting two months ago with me telling you what to do you know what this is now but there's no stay at home vampires there's no nuclear families there's just not there's just not actually I think I'm all like yeah the blood won't show up on the black colors Jasper I don't know if I can will it help you if I what make you forget about what just happened no is there any of their way I can help it's fine well then I guess let's get ready rolled in I could eat yeah you you know the guys just yeah by now Annabelle you have your favorites among them you know who is truly consenting and eager and willing to help you by generously giving you a part of them and it's one of those people that you go and he is in fact genuine and authentic and his desire to help you his sympathetic despite his mortal point of view his limited understanding of all of this he does find satisfaction in helping you with your hunger so he offers you his hand and he kneels down in front of you to make it easier and he offers it to you just one the fangs sink into the flesh and you know that moment of pure joy that moment where all your wants and needs are satisfied you're happy and she's there with you and you're together and it's bless but you don't lose yourself you remember and you make sure you take just enough to take the edge off so reduce your hunger pool that was some hmm that was a I'm glad I could help you close the wound for you so there's no trace of your feasting a little peck on the cheek Thanks seems almost shy about it Nellie wardrobe change mm-hmm what does that entail Oh quite a lot of black mm-hmm just probably just ripped up designer jeans a blouse a button-up blouse fitted some new rocket boots that are all blinged out okay they're flat ish flat-ish mmm ish enough enough to meet Jasper's requirements a nice wedge yeah maybe but it still goes right yeah he still goes with Debray it still goes with the shiny pari that's just not fantastic not gonna pop off okay so I make my way back downstairs visibly pissed off Glenn happy very before she comes back and while Annabelle's gone feeding could I just say something to Jasper was just the two of us out just Jasper and Victor right after she leaves I just say um I know what she's trying to do but those human connections they're only gonna get burned up nothing good can come from that you're probably right I don't know how to get that across to her I don't think you will for all intents and purposes you're doing the same thing you just have a better handle on you have the resources to take care of that in a better manner she does not and is not willing to accept your help because she wants to be the one to protect her you want to know the real reason why I listen to her and why the real reason why I took those guys off Illinois why because it may take something terrible happening for her to understand this new life that's true it might some people have to hit bottom before they realize what's important and where they and how the world works I don't think I don't think Annabelle is talking about it wrong our way she's been keeping in contact as interesting and it might work it might hang is the cavalry hates technology now but it could very well go the other way well and if it does eventually she won't have to worry about it anymore you know tried real hard to keep her away from Marc but you know we're never gonna win that battle I know she won't hurt him on purpose I know she won't hurt anyone on purpose I'm doing whatever I can to keep all of them safe but it's just we're just it's coming from all sides man freaking ghosts they're coming after Nellie's family what even is dance I can't put guys on her sister and gets ghosts you see the best way to at least in my experience to not have this problem is to not have this problem as soon as you have this problem it continues to get complicated all three of you have someone that makes you all vulnerable not all of us have the luxury of invisibility yeah and then they can return okay so no he comes back with her new nos Ratu underground exploration attire it's like Tomb Raider it release a new collection like this yes yes yeah a tomb that I'm gonna ready to have all the secrets from everybody's life what you knew about Mark he knew about Elinor of course I put people on there I would have put people and your sister had I known maybe this would have gone different why didn't you tell her she would have sorry done something impulsive into that moment when we all had secrets coming out and we say that we're gonna come [ __ ] clean why did you say anything I've got people making sure the people you love the most are it's still living and breathing that it doesn't constitute a secret to me that constitutes something obvious I guess connecting you Annabel off you're wailing for moley up there it's a lot it's a lot I understand that it's a lot but I'm just trying to keep everyone in one piece but our bar we get now can we yeah let's go okay I can eat my hair it's fine well is is it fine is he kind of always just say that as a default it's not always fine nothing's ever fine yeah okay but it's fine I don't it's like two feet in public I don't like what I am and it's just a thing I don't like anybody watching me feet so I'd rather be hungry than fees you'd rather put your life in I mean we we know what you do we know now you don't have to be ashamed of it I'd rather you know that happened then you lose control hurt yourself again you're always hurting yourself I mean things are hurting me let's I just happened to be in places where it does that that's oh yes you just happen to be in situation in a place where there's fire you know somebody you know takes a swing at you I just yeah just does it make you more comfortable if I fed before we love yes yes it would boost ii did all right we have one of two ways of doing this and these are non-negotiable either you all wait here and I come back in about an hour or we take a car and you all stand awkwardly or sit in a car while I go home I mean we know where your front door is man so I'm like we can drive by there on the way Hollywood Forever that's that's not hard all right then yeah you know did like you she's right you get beat up a lot I can teach you how to like take that a little better if you are interested concern I'm interested are you sure you two we know how to be I mean coming from him probably it well M&R there may or may not already know be visual aids yeah yeah I am definitely gonna take a budget yeah yeah yeah so what is the order of business well I suppose we get into a car and I get a ride home from dad awkwardly sit and then we head to Hollywood forever afterwards I'm gonna contact the staff and have a car and driver prepared yeah I would like the same guy Bailey if he's available he was a solid guy younger fella yeah the one who drove us to the to the park he seemed a long sword look you're gonna have to indulge me here you're gonna have to drop me off at least two blocks away oh of you know you know what I'm still gonna yell I love you at the window yeah you remember that whole target that's on my back yeah I don't want you guys pulling up directly in front of my transfer what if we just met you there would that be easier for you it doesn't matter driving me there it's probably quicker and we wouldn't probably need get things under way yeah well wait let's just drop me off a little ways away and then afterwards I'll make sure Bailey forgets where we went so it'll be fine all right I dunno it's good do that we drop him wherever he requests all right well so let's compress time a little bit the cars ready as planned Bailey is your driver as you recall he is one of the younger people on your team and he was professional and a fighter in the Navy he's got that dented in cheek as evidence of his pugilistic days he doesn't ask questions and drives the car expertly - where are you time to go Jasper's front door is barely a 20-minute drive from where you are and you want to drop him off several blocks away yes down rise wherever is requested and you wait in the vehicle to change your diet I will require a desire to change my diet I mean you don't want to know I don't want to eat people I mean sure but they're a lot more readily available and sometimes willing than being a sentient person in a cage we all have our ways of doing things Annabelle Bailey's eyebrows twitch but he says nothing it's metaphorical it's metaphorical we're all birds in our own gilded cages he pretends to find something great interest in the instrumentation - yeah I was honestly I'm amazed really because when you all stumbled into my house I was pretty sure that was the end of our time together and it is not something that generally goes over well I know why you didn't call me on it now but that's what didn't know at the time but you both seemed to have very little issue with what I was doing that is a rarity in the world the rest of the world finds out what I'm doing I'm even more dead than I already am why don't you change that and because I like what I'm do and I live the way I do and I live as an a narc because I get to do what I like to do I don't get to do what I like to do if I go back to enjoying the camerea and I don't like to hurt humans it may happen on occasion through accidental means but is not something I intend to do so I find a way however technical it might be to not do it I mean I just would like to make a case for changing to something that is not only more socially acceptable but also easier I'm sorry you do you think your way is kinder it acceptable I honestly don't know is it no you just could you guys give me just one second I activate all okay and I'm like hey Bailey he friends around in the driver's seat to look at you sir I need you to forget all about this yeah and could you just wait outside for just a second sure 30 seconds we family business here I'll take care of some things sure yeah you can make a phone call are you gonna be all right come on go I heard there's a rare one around here that's the thing the people find it Oh honk what a ladies lady babies psycho chairs are yeah maybe yeah no I'll get me give you the double tap when I'm ready for you to come back yeah yeah I got it is it are you sure you're gonna be okay always hundred percent yeah just but I do need you because we got a coup Salam I'm not here anymore he excuses himself lets himself out of the vehicle shuts the door pulls out his phone brings up the app and start hunting for Pokemon yeah you guys give me a hard time about being loose lipped about things I assume all your people are under yeah better if it's just misses I don't have to clean but yeah okay cool cool cool cool cool cool sorry please proceed hey you're right there it is oh I'm gonna get it what you do will kill you just as fast as what I do No you're breaking the masquerade every time you feed and that gets you just as dead is what I do he's not wrong I don't judge you because I can't not judging you it's just you are there have been a couple of times where you've put yourself in grave danger and the only way that you can get better is to go feed from your private stash which is like sometimes miles away also not wrong so neither of us are wrong but this is how I choose to spend my time in my life do you also tell vegans a wrong no I mean but yeah Egan's like our duty our lessening the amount of things that are in cages I don't let's see how this is comprable lessening the amount of human deaths oh well if Annabelle you're not gonna win on this one yeah let me just go okay okay go go eat go eat sorry it's I'm gonna get out of the car and activate unseen passage vanishing from science he leaves I just see it's a quick walk home I just worry he is all safe guards that you put in place remain untouched you do not believe that anyone who's been here I don't get hungrier say again from activating unseen passage I don't get hungrier okay so you succeeded in the rouse check yeah all right so at 3:00 mm-hm when you get home and you are able to sit your hunger how much do you take two points you remain at one hunger yeah okay doesn't take long no but you're glad you did and your Beast is glad you did about time yeah you can't save her from me forever drink I drink takes time but it's never quite long enough sated with just a little stab of hunger pang and your gut take two of the hunger dice out of your pool when you're ready you can return to the vehicle I make sure everything's locked up put the safeguards back in place I do take an additional item with me when I leave I take and put in my backpack a mistake wooden stick Wednesday you have the nice hunter ones from before oh yeah that's right made a note and you return to the waiting vehicle yeah do you remain unseen as you go I do okay well we require not another roust chat maybe defeating the purpose here yep I'm fine the Beast remains satisfied and you return when you interact with the vehicle of course you'll have to because I just tap on the window sir is it okay to come in now I don't think there any more pokemon out here mmm I say uh yeah I just got to get something out of the back and I hop out and I open the back door so it's like ah I must have left it yeah man yeah let's go I get back in the front seat I close the door after a couple seconds I get back in the front seat yeah he's ready to go yeah weird night weird night we got to go over to Hollywood forever yeah whatever you say sir yeah buddy mine accident a few years back I'd like to pay my respects on his birthday we would also like to pay our respects on his watch that's nice of all of you yeah hmm he drives Hollywood forever I don't understand what you're upset about like in the grand scheme of things of the things that we have not disclosed to one another the fact that there was armed guards ready to rush to someone's aid does not seem like a violation thrilled about it but I appreciate the concern but I don't like the mistrust but you also didn't disclose everything about Eleanor either I said I took care of it yeah but you were following Marc and didn't tell me so I feel like if I can just kind of be like yeah I understand you meant well that I think I never said that I wasn't following work what specific I'm not following no we're doing something yeah yeah actually we are because you guys all made me disclose all of my secrets yeah so it is semantics hey you having a member of the Inquisition as a pet on a leash is not at all the same thing is it all at all oh okay let's just let's just let's do it let's do a little hypothetical here let's do a thought experiment we're driving by the way during all this Bailey is maintaining forward momentum he is trying very hard not to hear anything this poor guy is gonna have an aneurysm with all the things I take away from him you know yeah we'll get like a legit limo no let's say the thought experiment remember when those people came to the club took a shot at all of us and we dealt with it imagine if that had been at the house of someone we loved and because of that there was people there to help them and they got saved it just so happens it didn't happen thank the maker it might happen tonight it might happen tomorrow I understand the concept of having a tail on someone for their safety it's just the lack of trust or not telling us that there is a tail on them I mean but it's ok it's ok it's fine like we're we're moving on everything's fine the whole purpose of us getting all of those things out in the open was to eliminate this lack of trust and neither of you have a ground to stand on in calling each other out so I think it's exactly what you said it's just to be let go because well neither of you did anything bad you still feel like you were wronged by the other so I don't I don't feel wronged it just is just I was just surprised I would say that is a accurate description of how I felt uh no actually it's not at all I super assumed you were still doing that no matter what she said because that's you know probably what I would have done where the tables turn so so in the interests of not having to do this again is there anything else anybody wants to let out let me know if we need to stop this car first well since you like to keep leashes on people or tails on them my sisters in Miami I would like to have eyes on her if you can I can probably call in some favors obviously it's different than you know here in our own backyard but yeah I'll see what I can do okay I sent her off just in case this blows up in our face any of this really a good idea well you know who we sent to Vancouver so as far as I know that's fine is there anybody else that we have a tie to that we need to look out for you know what you know what in the interest of full disclosure I have someone remember a a couple years ago when we were importing that fashion from China for the first line mm-hmm we came across those people that were shipping more than fashion in those containers okay I've kept eyes on those people it was we stumbled across a human trafficking thing we got a great scenario at all and we stopped it we stopped it but the kids that were in that container maybe they're all students at Griffith College now they don't eat they don't know any of our names I mean you know they everybody knows our names but they don't know we had anything to do with it but there's some people that I also have eyes on all right okay that's why I don't have a problem with that anyone else you know my thing yeah yeah okay well I guess that's it then I'll write here sir yeah you didn't mean the cemetery right yeah I'm like yeah yeah you can just drop us off out front yeah I'm like here good yeah here's good Hollywood Forever is one of the oldest cemeteries in Los Angeles it's been here for at least a century it's located on Santa Monica Boulevard well within the borders of Barron Abrams territory studios at Paramount Pictures and join one side of it high walls topped by sharpened iron spikes pointed toward the street and circle the entire acreage punctuated here and there by a lock gates it's famous because famous people who are interred here prominent people from the entertainment industry as well as those who played vital roles in shaping the city of Los Angeles some of the famous names that are buried here are sessile B DeMille Judy Garland Bugsy Siegel the gangster fay wray both Douglas Fairbanks is Rudolph Valentino dee dee Ramone and Griffith J Griffith Oh Jasper you know that it's the Gower Street gate and you know that since there are guests for dinner it will be unlocked and you know that there will be no guard and no cameras so that's where you guide them you know in through the gate into the silent city of the Dead if you would all follow me we are expected before we go in before we get out of the car I'm like remember pretty much the moment we get out of this vehicle assume we're being watched and listened to in this is super cliche I didn't I don't live here I give her our over by the brew on me like I'm on I mean limits come on all right respect face this is my respect face I'm ready let's go so I mean I know we're being watched this stuff but it's relevant to that like I went on a date yeah once and like you were seeing uh-oh I think it was testing candles something stupid yeah yeah we snuck off with Douglas Fairbanks Grave you [ __ ] on Fairbanks I mean I don't know if they sat there and watched the whole time they aren't they absolutely no you were doing though like have you never know also I'm sure a bunch of people saw you too yeah this I mean no but yeah wait wait wait why did you go to date to the cemetery that's not we heard about this conversation they they have film screenings there in the evenings a lot of times like during the summer it's very pleasant it's a great date she's not buying kids today acted on to one of the mausoleums means I guess we can but now we know there's not for ought to hear but alright alright I mean there's movies that get played here during the summer that's just you know if we live through the next month month and a half yeah we super can all come back to Hollywood forever for a movie night yeah great sure no more grapes no right no not on the night we're not I mean unless you want to one Fairbanks I mean like Valentino maybe okay maybe I would be horrified if I was I think you'd be a great dad really I'm with Jasper on that one can't be worse than hers really Carver's in his hole so you lead the way you lead the way along the main path through the center of the cemetery passing by tombstones small crypts I'd like to make that no I'm tiptoeing like - holy like picking my feet up trying you're trying to be clean a silent or are you trying to keep your shoes try to keep my shoes clean it's not difficult on the asphalt path great it's still gonna keep this walk up I activate aw what we're walking if they're gonna watch I want them to remember that they saw me sure you passed by grave after grave from the richest to the poorest from the famous to the completely ordinary everybody ends up the same and eventually many end up in a place like this but not you for you there are no graves there are no tombstones there are no memorials there is nothing to mark your passing when you meet the final death and that cheerful thought is never far from you in this place you turn left at the broken gravestone and you walk straight to the Griffith JW Griffith obelisk tall white pillar commemorating the burial place of your ancestor yeah yeah I'm gonna activate seen the unseen just that just in case you I had no idea this was here wits and occult please can you not oh yeah three four five successes mm-hmm so staring with supernatural acuity into the night there are certainly ghosts here oh there are spirits what's up you count you can't count that high easily but there is nothing around his grave you still have your jacket right yep hmm you I will do let's just go underground think this place is safe hmm Jasper okay you know that to the right of the Griffith obelisk here to look for a little stone crypt with an iron door you opened the iron door go inside after you just by the way before I go down there cuz I saw Lord of the Rings I remember the whole of the ghost thing did you bring the do you a question or fine here okay you didn't feel like you need it I don't feel like you need it and I do go in I do my best to not act afraid or like grossed out or anything I'm trying to show the respect the little stone [ __ ] is empty but you know where the hidden door is yeah the hidden door with the stairs behind it a lead down yeah got some Lord of the Rings were the good guys though mm no mercenary Aragorn kind of had to remember motivate the sword like they wanted this right yeah but like but like they helped out what you know it was your dance ex machina this is useful they helped him in exchange for a boon Aragorn had to promise them something vital in order to get them to help you know two weeks ago out of left about that but maybe it's like a ghost army here in der Hollywood Forever if you'll remember our resident expert on ghost seemed very surprised that those ghosts that we encountered were doing what they were doing so I don't think it's a common thing just for leads you along an access tunnel until you reach a velvet rope and here is where we will pause our story somewhere beneath Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles there is an access tunnel that connects to the outside world by a hidden door inside a small stone crypt and it's through this access tunnel that you've come to visit Jasper's clan mates there's a velvet rope stretching across the tunnel oh this is unexpected beyond there is only darkness only shadows except for a dim flickering light it's very Hollywood yeah I'm not used to being on this side of the rope may we enter yeah what do we what do we do I want to surpass I do like it when people have manners yes please be welcome hey thank you is there a clip on the Rope there is I reach out like just in case if anybody's gonna say anything and I unclip it and I'm just like after you okay as you step into the room beyond the velvet rope Nellie you realize you're stepping into something wet and you feel the liquid flow over the tops of your boots hey your feet stay dry but it's so dark in here you can't tell what the liquid is does it smell bad it smells damp moist musty and old but not foul gonna still tiptoe well you can certainly tiptoe your way through the water okay don't be shy don't be shy join us for dinner once I flip the rope back on I sort of looked towards you and I just say thank you all for agreeing to host us tonight let's go come on I start walking down the hall it's in fact a large room that you're walking through and since the flickering lights are the only source of illumination I'm going to presume that you walk toward those yeah I followed him whatever Jasper does is what I do I'm gonna go towards the light I still have sense dancing am i seeing anything yeah well you might very well see some things here prepare your dice pool oh there's a book coming out they're not Surratt to nudists so we don't really need to wear clothes mm-hmm wits and aspects take it as a courtesy that I do I will roll in q-3 successes you'll see the younger ones your clothes can you make those disappear like with you or like new in the darkness like you know against the edges of the room you do see two figures grotesque figures one whereas a stunning beautiful Couture crimson red ball gown over her horrifying figure the other is dressed as though he might be on his way to a industrial nightclub all leather and rivets over his equally disgusting form but is the voice that greeted you comes again it's not coming from either of the two that you can see but somewhere else in the darkness okay so nice of you to join good to have you Jasper nice to see you nice to hear you oh yes quite quite from out of the shadows three figures approached the flickering light you can see our candles tall white candles in polished silver candelabras that sit upon a large mahogany table that is set for dinner with elegant place settings and polish silverware in the very dim light of the candles you can begin to pick out the features of the room furniture is antique but well preserved on the walls or movie posters from to 1930s in the 40s the 50s and you realize that each of the posters is for a film starring someone who's buried in the cemetery the three figures approach the table one of them is tall broad-shouldered with greenish gray skin and large pointed ears sunken eyes and very large teeth he wears a tuxedo shirt and a well tied bowtie suspenders expensive slacks and patent leather shoes that disappear into the murky water that he's standing in you've come a long way from your homes Jasper nice to see you hello mr. golden pleasure a pleasure he approaches the table and stands behind the chair that is at the head of it well cast and crew night Baron temple I extend my hand to him and I say mr. golden I don't know that I've had the opportunity to make your acquaintance or or have I we've never met in person he does shake your hand it's very scaly like I try not to flinch or anything you say thank you very much for the audience and miss Griffith a big fan of Iraq before yeah it's a pleasure to meet your acquaintance so think thank you he leans in very close so close you can smell the gray of breath in his mouth sniffs at you ah yes mm-hmm miss Annabelle hello mr. golden it is a pleasure to meet you thank you so much for the invitation very welcome you were right she is allow me to introduce my child er this intoxicating creature is Amalia she curtsies hello Amalia also has the greenish gray skin of her sire and the giant pointed ears but her teeth are small Nellie you think her gown is probably last season but still Couture and extraordinarily expensive it's a shame that the hem is dragging in the whatever this is and utterly ruining the line parent Apple I take her hand and I bow and I do kiss her hand now I say Amalia yes very pleased to make your acquaintance of course it is and you are the other child er shuffles forward Hey Mitnick hey how you doing I'm all right how are you could be better could be worse you know you know how it is yeah yeah can't we all this he dressed his lavishly as the others no he's wearing uh he's wearing a lot of leather and a lot of rivets and studs he's got some big earrings and leather wristbands with metal studs in him little spikes all the way around he looks like he's gonna go raving hey how you doing oh well Molly Oh your gown is just beautiful yes where'd you get such a thing thank you oh you know you should know I'm just curious where you got it Gary bought it for me oh that's very kind gesture you must come by my store sometime perhaps I can uh I really doubt that well perhaps I can get something down to you undo me any favors fair enough well if you should ever be looking for some sort of other Couture outfits I'd be at I'm sure I will know where not to go I see not to go please excuse Mallya she's a bit sensitive her gowns don't fit me either Amalia so I I understand I can imagine as an aside to the storyteller the posters on the wall mm-hm Abrams has posters all over his place too yes he does do I recognise any of these movies as being movies that Abrams produced no these are all older from an earlier age than when he was involved in the film industry these are posters like Zorro starring Tyrone Power and the sea hawk with Errol Flynn King Kong with Fay Wray Gone with the Wind The Wizard of Oz Cleopatra the Golden Age hmm for some I guess well please make yourselves at home we'll be eating shortly I didn't know that we were going to eat I would we would we would have brought something yeah right sure thank you for for having us anywhere in particular please make yourselves at home Amalia sits to Gary's right hmm and Mitnick sits to his left leaving you to sit wherever you want at the table I'll just take a seat at the table very well Gary it has been some time since we've spoken how are you can't complain can't complain could do with a bit less excitement same hmm what's been keeping you busy lately well you know new prince in town had a visit oh did you well he knocked at the door hmm so I'm sure you know the general situation I daresay we do yeah what are your thoughts let's eat first yeah picks up a spoon and taps it against his wineglass a moment later there's much more light in the room as a door at the far end opens electric light beyond spills out illuminating the room and allowing you to see the furnishings a little bit more clearly not only is there the excellent if old furniture but the walls are paneled in wood and the accoutrements are polished brass it's a it's a very nicely decorated place but it's reminiscent of a room that would have been popular maybe in the 20s the individual who exits the door is not in us for a - you're not even sure that it's a vampire it's a person a human you think but its skin is scabby and scaly like a lizard's dry some of it is sloughing off this individual carries out two large silver trays big silver bells covering them to hide the contents behind him another person a woman with the same appearance quickly they sit the dishes in front of you and then they bring more for their hosts and a few moments they disappear back through the doorway and close it leaving you in flickering candle light and deep shadow once again something is making noise under the metal bells over the plates there's a screeching scrabbling squeaking Bon Appetit Gary lifts the lid off his plate and picks up the live rat ah perfect just the way I like them I pick up mine and grab the red he takes a big bite Cheers relishing it I grabbed mine too mmm this is perfection oh you've outdone yourselves this time delicious do bite into it but it violates all of my palate respects I don't know what that means well you could employ the blush of life to keep it down I would like to temporarily I'm trying not to offend them make a rouse check your beast is revolted the taste is like rancid oil mixed with turpentine and bitter coal and ashes smooth Gary just knots he's too into his rat to to talk to you Amalia and Mitnick are enjoying their meal as well I mean so does Nellie and try it it's moving oh it's alive I'm gonna kind of play with it a little like kind of sound like a child kind of messes with the food on their plate to make it look like baby just a little just a little just a little at least try to get something it tastes good it's a rat all right I'm gonna bite into it oh you know how you felt when you saw Paulina's spring collection back in San Francisco oh this is great I love it you want to try to hide it yeah delicious just like mom used to make you can either roll definitey and larceny or dexterity and stealth I just drain the route you just drink the rat I really do drink it later list you've had rat before this is among the better rodents that you had two successes two successes tuck it away in your jacket pocket and hope you weren't seeing Shh thank you hmm it's not often that we have guests for dinner thank you Oh you fed seconds couldn't get stuffed mmm of course mmm of course such a rare delicacy this is true that I'd heard stories I didn't know they were true mmm wonderful experience for the palate you were so hungry you ate the whole thing I like a little bit of roughage the bones do make it crunchy so how may we be of assistance to the Baron of the valley and his associates Valley a coterie associate silvery coterie yes the the stories are true mr. golden just to make sure that I'm addressing you properly do you speak for the Nosferatu in the area are you in an independent like what I want to make sure that I'm showing you the proper respect do your station Amalia makes a sound somewhere between a raspberry and a grunt Nelly she's staring at your necklace I mean mr. Colten hair has been around for a very long time and overlocked mm-hmm has a lot of information baron Abrams and I are contemporaries so I speak for this coterie and for many Nosferatu in many other territories we're less territorial than most clans yes and we're a little less interested in politics but you were of sufficient state station that Vannevar felt the need to reach out to you well you know what they say those who ignore our clan fail maybe they don't say that strictly but I like the sound of it it is implied he is implied and how did you respond to the messenger to mr. price oh you know it's polite to listen when the print speaks so we listened and then we laughed and then he left or you all normally have a mind of the the ivory tower in Princes or Mitnick just shakes his head you know I don't care I mean I couldn't care less a narcs camera love whatever longus not the savate yeah not the Saban at all what you guys all come to understand a little better is that as long as we get to do what we want to do we don't care who runs things that's more or less true now to a certain extent there are limits Ella yes I don't like the sound of this blood tax for instance no no that's that's not a thing I just what one other question um Forest Lawn it's over on our side of the hill yeah is there a similar Nosferatu assemblage at Forest Lawn well they're not as refined clearly not clearly not thank you no celebrities really Michael Jackson is over there I mean that should count for something like I mean there's some no sure Jasper can introduce you I believe Gary's moved there ever since the debacle in Santa Monica oh yeah hmm good to know well it as you speak to your Valley associates please let them know that you know they're always welcome and I would love to speak with any of them Oh charming don't think you could stop us true but I would like you to know that I'm not trying to duly noted a fair point so you've decided not to take a part in this conflict not to choose a side well not yet but you're considering it mm-hmm I see our role as more of neutral nation unless I'm given some incentive so it's up for negotiation then well I believe that the Baron would agree that all things are up for negotiation all things are up for negotiation what have you come to negotiate that you join in the side of the anarch's mid Nick and Amalia both look at Gary very intently that is to say fight yes you bring extremely valuable resources to this fight information is power when money is not power and they're definitely in tandem what isn't it for us you want to be left alone I think we both know the Camarillo will never truly leave you alone as long as they want something from you they will always show up on your doorstep we can guarantee continued autonomy unimpeded autonomy and I'm pretty sure we're not gonna ask for a blood tax either I hadn't considered it once the free states they're called that for a reason yeah but we have to share them with toreador toreador free can it possibly be they can be positively delightful especially when they're up there and you're all are down here and everybody has their own space to be themselves I mean look at our beautiful diverse coterie we've gotten us for r2 and toreador getting along just fine don't we Jasper yeah nearly just fine mm-hmm great mahlia doesn't look convinced but she shuts up no I asked for permission to come here because while it may not be what I want to do we've been put into a situation where we have to be at the forefront of this conflict through no real desire of my own was that what was going through your head when you snicker-snack the sheriff and I wasn't a lot going through my head when I did that it was something going through his head though have you decided what you're going to do and that's part of this little thing we're doing here now what could help us in this situation would be information that we don't necessarily possess how lucky for you that I probably do exactly and I have informed them that the answers to questions have a price well nothing is free no so we are here for an exchange ah to get answers to things these fine kindred may have in exchange for your fee as things should work and what might that Phoebe well that always depends on the information required and of course the degree of confidence you needed it to be honest with you it's not going to be just particular information it's going to be continued [Music] is that supposed to happen mr. golden it does happen from time to time we've had some odd experiences of late they've made us jumpier than we usually would be I apologize for that well we'll just put on more candles you don't mind ándale I do yeah we've had some negative experiences with fire also but we wouldn't it's fine it would not be just simple items of information it would be continued assistance in what could potentially become a war it would be assurances that information would also not be sold to the camera Ella well that's very expensive yes yes you ever heard Aesop's fable about the bats I don't believe I have once upon a time there was a great war between the beasts and the birds of the land now the bats being both birds and beasts in their mind flying and having soft bodies like the bird-like like mice they decided that they could play both sides when they were asked by the birds to help they'd help as long as the birds were winning sometimes they would feed information to the beasts if it was in their best interest at the end of sound very intelligent creatures to me they made out very well in that war but I like this story already when the war ended after that bloody conflict the two groups got together and they realized that even though that they had settled their differences that the bats had been playing them both against each other and that wasn't fair so they drove the bats away from the birds and away from the beasts and that is why bats live in the dark in caves all alone and a sub said that the moral the story was that he who is neither one thing nor the other has no friends you can't imagine that if you play both sides against each other that either will extend a hand of friendship to you once this is all over that was a very interesting story I'm sure your friend Jasper has told you that our clan isn't interested in your friendship I have made every effort now if you are implying and if I am to infer that when this conflict is over should you prevail you will seek to what drive us out of our home I would never we would never but we can't speak we this isn't even our territory I don't think that Baron Abrams would be as magnanimous he can bill me you're never well that story is all well and good Annabel and I see your point you don't get rid of us because we keep existing because no one knows we're here now let us say for the sake of discussion and so it's not ruin a perfectly good dinner party I mean we haven't even got to dessert yet let us say for the sake of discussion that the fable is somewhat accurate and were we to do as we have done for millennia we might suffer some untoward consequences when the dust settles I would thank you for the warning but I think I would prefer to take my chances you if I may one thing I think we both understand is business and ostensibly the Nosferatu is one of the great clans of the Camarillo maybe they push you all to the edges a little unjustly if I might say but theoretically would you agree that all things being equal the nos ferrata are in fact aligned with the ivory tower I think that was true was I think you will find that many of our brethren yeah are less inclined to the ivory tower than ever before it is true that many prefer to side when they take a side at all with the unbound the camerea in their ever fair and even minded ways when recently things went badly for them and as far as I'm to be made aware I went around this second Inquisition starts getting bad they blamed a lot of what happened on us I did hear a rumor about shrek net Mitnick punches up and he looks like he wants to disappear under the table you could swear that he might even be blushing he's turning a very dark shade of green yeah that oh because well because again I have the utmost respect for the nos ferrata as information brokers but there was a catastrophic information breach somewhere in tender Homa with the rise of a second Inquisition and rub it in yes but you see that information great she only happened because they were looking hmm yeah if the camis had tipped him off in the first place Shrek net would still be up and running and you know things would be better which means that's even more of a reason for you all to perhaps be less inclined to actively side with the camera Trello because I can understand you you're gonna bring back Shrek net you ain't got that kind of dough I mean Ventre we have all the dough you even backup your personal computer I mean I've recently brought on a new IT guy that is handling all that stuff for me yeah I have huh yeah I would love some insight if you you're a technical guy is that the thing you do hi I mean yeah I see my ring I would love it but over the I understand again I understand Annabelle's point I understand the need to pick a side and what is coming I also am intimately familiar with being crushed on both sides to the point of not necessarily being able to declare one or the other so while I'm not necessarily asking you all to just throw in and say we're an arcs and burn down that ivory tower we would like a close working relationship even if that means all we can count on is continued neutrality the camera Ella don't respect you they don't respect anything that's below their lofty idea of I guess ancient ideals of vampirism kindred she got a point Gary I don't like her but she's got a point she grows on you patnik I don't know I think she kind of makes sense yeah Amalia we're going to win you over you're not the first person that didn't like us at first he didn't like us at first but give us a chance Oh it's debatable now what we seek on our side of things is to provide a safe haven for all kindred in Los Angeles what would you have us do cards on the table mr. golden since you probably know anyway here's what we're trying to accomplish she's absolutely right in the valley we'd like to create a safe haven for our people we believe I believe the Inquisition is an imminent threat to all of us on this we are agreed and I believe our greatest chance at survival is cooperation I would rather avoid an active war with the camera if possible I would like to open diplomatic relationships with them if possible and if we're forced to bloodshed I would like to win swiftly and decisively we don't ask that you particularly risk any of your people we ask for any information that might help our cause and we ask that you not actively harm it intriguing it's very kind of you to offer us hospitality which is what I think you are offering us to all kindred and accept the Sabon and I might admit me hmm you must understand of course that from our perspective as I said earlier you could hardly stop us if we wish to be in your territory but we would not wish to provoke you either just like we're enjoying this delightful Pleasant meal I would like for all of us to be able to interact openly and pleasantly with each other it seems to be the idea that we're not only wanting to change the way the camera looks said things and to remove them from the situation but to change the way that the anarch's tend to treat each other as well well our friend Annabelle here is much of an idealist and she has ideas of change whether they work or not as a to the Future but we aren't necessarily looking to go back to how the anarch's used to be either in the interests of full disclosure since you have been magnanimous I suppose I can afford to be as well and I shall admit to you that when I shoot a similar invitation to the ivory towers representatives to come dine with us it was declined fool why did they give a reason because as you said we are beneath them they treat us all like we're beneath them but you came you came down into the dark through the sludge and you enjoyed your dinner and that counts for something it's it's not nothing we came down here not just because we want something from you it's not what can you do for us it's what can we do for you for too long the Nosferatu have been disregarded in this city I cannot disagree with you there so this is the exact opposite of the way negotiations usually go but yes to agree with Annabelle is there a request that you have of us I obviously have quite some say in what happens in the valley I have at least the ears of the other barons is there something that you would like mr. Goldman because perhaps maybe we are going to be granting something to you I suspect that there is little you could personally offer that we could not provide for ourselves but for the sake of discussion let us ask my children what they would have well you Mitnick well okay Wow yeah hmm you talked about mmm-hmm what is that ah it was it was amazing it was it was like a computer network and we could talk to nos all over the place totally secure and until it was yeah until it wasn't Inquisition took the whole thing I mean that's how they you know that's kind of how they started picking us off then you've got to know better than anyone if the camarillo runs these parts that's not gonna be a thing anymore they're trying to go back to someone told me it's not 2019 to them it's 1519 to them so I mean we can't rebuild that system it's it's not gonna happen but maybe locally we could do something if we had you know backing hmm I mean you know me you know what I do maybe we our interests are aligned maybe maybe in amalia what would you like yeah it's got to be something I want three things I want your bracelet and I want you to be my personal shopper for a night you love going on shopping trips and she'd say I did didn't I yeah yeah yeah there's a toreador his name is Rex I'm wanting could you please clarify in what way would you like just drop him off where I could find him I'll do the rest oh so you don't hate all of us no I hate him depends on what she wants to do with him yeah maybe may I ask what exactly are you planning on doing you'd rather not know yeah maybe it's like Annabelle's thing I don't I don't you know it that's neither here nor there okay so that's what I want Shrek met Emily I think those are all very reasonable so I guess then the question becomes is what do we get in exchange if I were to say that I can lend my personal resources and interest into rebuilding at least a local version of Shrek met a local hub which i think is useful personally if we do get amalia upgraded with the help of a legendary fashionista what are you prepared to offer us in return well it sounds like my child are offering you individual separate bargains they don't speak for this coterie mm-hmm nor the clan hmm yeah they are welcome to make separate deals with you if they wish but it sounds like over all that judging by your chilled dirt children I'll try it child er judging by a child er that resources and respect well let us say that at this moment I am persuaded to consider the possibility of perhaps staying out of the fight and not aiding your enemies which is a considerable thing that is a substantial value what would that cost a blind eye Griffith Park holds many secrets hmm I wish access to them I can't agree to that at this exact moment because even though Griffith Park is absolutely in my domain I know there are others that have a vested interest in the park whose trust I would not want to violate but I do think it is definitely negotiable that is Ngata to twitch does you credit but that is my price access to the park or at least its secrets we can negotiate the finer terms of the agreement down to the last exclamation point if we wish but in general terms yes if you will give me a couple of days to make some other inquiries to make sure that this would be acceptable well if your associates are the type who walk in the daylight then I'm not sure you need their permission Griffith Park is the complicated places you will know I am intrigued perhaps it would be even interesting to have launched a joint investigation into the park perhaps perhaps one other question if we were to ask about Prince Thomas's strength I personally I think he was driven out of San Francisco so I don't know how much he can have with him especially since Marcos came to such an unfortunate end we know about Strauss we know about Chas he there may or may not be a la sombra around who may or may not be working with the prince if we were to find out a little more not necessarily specifics not necessarily where they're sleeping but just who came down with the prince what would that cost well I think I could see my way clear to giving you a general impression of strength in numbers for mm-hmm shall we say a minor favor to be named later minor favor that's important information now this would be a favor from the Baron not all favors are created equal I understand as long as we can agree that the major or minor nature of the favor might be determined by me I believe in exchange for a general overview of who might have come into town with Prince Thomas perhaps they've already left who can say but at least Camarillo members who've been spotted in the area lately and yes in exchange for a minor favorite that would be acceptable to me the Baron of the valley agreed our count our tally if you will let us say we will round up for convenience mm-hmm perhaps four dozen kindred already not all from San Francisco mainly ven true toreador trimmer a smattering of gangrel most of whom are hmm suing for peace or attempting to return to the camerea interesting no bruja yeah because there was the thing that no Nosferatu perish the thought if you in the clan of the moon at the mark aliens and one la sombra now was that worth a minor favor to be named later I definitely think that was worth a minor favor to be named later I just did if I could ask a question just an opinion an opinion a Straus seems to be a particular problem personally but is there anyone that you mr. golden in particular would be wary of you as a man of your station in agent power would be particularly concerned about well I think you are wise to be concerned about maximilian strauss he knows Los Angeles quite well hmm and he is a warlock of no small power apart from mr. Strauss the la sombra should be your next concern that is a particular problem it is a particular problem who are they the la sombra were are a clan of kindred one of the 13 great clans of which your own is one they were hmm they were at odds with much of the rest of the kindred at one point in time and they and some other dissenters formed a completely different faction you have heard of the savate yeah there has been a change of heart shall we say and more than a few la sombra are seeking membership in the camerea it is extraordinary I never thought I would live to see this yes that doesn't seem characteristic at all it is very difficult now to obtain accurate information from other cities at speed things are much slower than they used to be hmm thanks to the Inquisition but we have confirmed that this is the case and at least one of these kindred has come to Los Angeles so your children seem to have asked us of different prices is it possible that we could also negotiate some other things as I believe we said before all is negotiable excellent I am also looking for information on our loving Harold has price Oh Oh mr. price yeah and I would have paid good money to see him down here would they have enjoined this sumptuous banquet I hate that guy just give him to her I don't like her either but I mean those are my choices give him up it's not how we do it understood you wish to know what exactly about mr. price so much of details I can about him his dwelling how many people he has with him miss Griffith allow me to pay you the compliment of being blunt you have eyes looking for mr. price already yes but I said I can only see during sunlight if you will I'm trying to seek out information that perhaps he can't find mm-hmm don't sell your pet short fair enough what the information you request is available what if I were to ask for your assistance underground for mr. price at some point underground yes hmm you wish him incarcerated or you wish many a things for this kindred avoid ah I I believe that it might be worth bringing him down below no one likes chance I am NOT a member of his fan club to remove Harold but elder venture Prince no small task mm-hmm of course it can be done are you really willing to pay such a price yes that and again the finer details can be negotiated but of course Griffith would require no less than a major boon to be repaid later at a time of my choosing from you personally and Amalia will design your fall collection that is a gorgeous gal and she's wearing right now that is I liked her fashion sense I think she's fantastic now we can negotiate the finer details and you may have some nights to think about it about what we would offer at the very least is assistance in location immobilization and incarceration mm-hmm not included fair enough and am i safe to make the assumption that you guys know the ins and outs of the underground none better so if one two were to plan an escape perhaps would be helpful that could be included in the negotiations noted as for me I realized that you all are the best network in Los Angeles and you probably know all of the anarch's in the area any that are unaffiliated with the cause who have not answered the calls thus far I'm seeking to reach them a narcs unaffiliated kindred thin Bloods thin Bloods yes there are many thin Bloods in Los Angeles they tend to keep to themselves they're not wanted mmm we want them we want them mmm you say that now we've met some and they're no worse than the rest of us really they also deserve a home we can get word to them that you wish to speak prior arrangements prevents me from providing you with more information at this time that's fine one must respect one's bargains and deals I said the same but just to clarify someone else has already tapped to you for information on thin blitz I'm afraid that is the limit of what I can discuss mmm-hmm now then I am NOT a one where that our help could be invaluable in this conflict and with free access to the secrets of Griffith Park you will obtain much from us I will make you another offer there is a gang they used to be part of nines crew he knows all about them he could probably find them for you called the ball carries or the Valkyries depending on how you like to pronounce it bring them to your cause sway them to your side if you can do that I will double the strength of what we bring really what's your interest in them if I ask I think we'd be much more entertaining if you found out for yourself from having been around said do I know anything about them does that mean anything to me uh-huh who what right I don't go downtown yeah nice I got it okay I'll ask nines thank you oh it's getting late I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave soon is there any other business you'd like to conduct before we conclude all of my problems are you pretty straightforward I have anything to ask the wizard that's a reference that they would get there that's it Nick points to the poster of The Wizard of Oz Judy Garland I do have one thing I'd like to know do we know our stress stays well I don't know if we do but I do all right what do you need for that information what is your interest in Strauss that costs you hmm yes it was tricky to do business with family yeah it's more of a professional curiosity I wonder we hear a lot of things I'm sure you do the location of his Haven yes that can be done I know you Jasper I know what you can do I know what you were capable of I know you are living on the doorstep of what I want to look at I know it puts me in an rather interesting situation doesn't it interesting is one word for it when we have access to the secrets of Griffith yes I want a personal tour a guided tour all right I want to see it for myself I'm sure you do well when that deal happens that can be something that it's not out of the realm of possibility there's someone down there I should like to see again no no I see I will be an interesting day won't it though yes well so as always we don't wish to wear out our welcome I would just say it's always difficult to ask questions when I don't necessarily know what knowledge is possessed so I would say please please feel free to reach out to me at any time if you come across some information you feel might be a value yes as you said everything is negotiable you have barely scratched the surface but we prefer to answer questions rather than pose them I feel we've hmm accommodated you to an unusual degree you have been very generous Mitnick I'm sure you have my phone number let's talk yeah do it same thing up and running yeah we might have a song in alignment of interests I'm down and I slowly stand up like Gary Amalia and Mitnick stand as well take a few nights think about your bargains and Jasper can get word back to us about what you decide good evening good evening thank you for being our guests thank you for your hospitality good night good night good night ups back into the shadows and fades from your view let's leave and then Amalia does the same and then finally Mitnick I do everything I can to not vomit in the in the cemetery like I try you figure you'll make it to the tunnel I still fully believe they're looking but I try to be as discreet as possible look gargle it up ad it comes up decorates the tunnel wall a charming crimson it's okay oh you depart the way you came yes back through the access tunnel back up to the Crypt once you get out into the night and get a better look at your situation not only those boots can't wear them ever again you're back out under the somewhat cleaner night air into the cemetery I'm presuming you make your way out yes back to the car where Bailey is waiting ready to take you to a club mmm I'd like to tour the head towards the pollute the place in NoHo yes we're nowhere you're done right I mean I don't know how long got ours to die yeah head towards NoHo head towards North Hollywood yeah the arts district I'm like you yeah hey I'm gonna show you the place I put an offer on but I look towards the back of the car especially the way back I'm like should we reach around I don't know when like a couple minutes and out of my I don't ever need to see one of those is real alive it's a little woozy from being you know stuck in your pocket for a while is it is that for Ramona yeah doesn't like remember the rat back it does not like you it doesn't like being in your hand it's frightened scared it's freaked out Oh squirming trying to get no it's terrified disappears under see oh well uh how'd that go you tell me did you feel you got stuff that was worth what you paid mmm-hmm it's not completely clear what I've got to pay for it but theoretically yes I mean that secrets of Griffith Park are gonna get explored sometime we don't have the time for it at the moment I mean realistically it's not my thing I don't understand it anyway it's really only you and ever that I wanted to get to sign off on it yeah just once they get in never getting them out I know I think knowing being able to know when we go to bed that the camera Ella aren't gonna be getting sold but are gonna be buying our secrets it's a very valuable gift you understand that even if they do help and they don't help them whatever information we give them doesn't go away mm-hmm secrets are tricky things you've all discovered the dangers of withholding information and yet sometimes it is necessary to protect those we love and defend ourselves against those who would harm us secrets are the stock and trade of the nos Virata and yours too and in way of speaking this seems like a good place to pause our story for tonight elsewhere in Los Angeles this evening as always secrets have a way of getting out okay Greg this is a standard debriefing well as standard as these things can get yeah just ask me questions okay what happened when you got to LA well it was a [ __ ] show from the beginning we were the special Affairs Division so you know what that's about everything in anything outside the box you know a sasquatch aliens ghosts all the [ __ ] you guys laugh at if it looks impossible we check it out but then we got a tip about these vamp blank bodies and I'm talking about very very credible leads I send all the files up to HQ and we get a big fat nothing so we decide hey we'll go down to the coast ourselves have a few laughs hunt some bloodsuckers then then we came here we had some laughs hunted some bloodsuckers you get the point right but what did you find when you got here you know what I [ __ ] found blank bodies alright these suck heads we're just hanging out in the LA nightlife and it goes deep I'm talking a whole shadow society the this these big crazy midnight politics an actual [ __ ] conspiracy all that [ __ ] and still not a peep from HQ except for the occasional message received ping for all of our reports so you took steps oh we took steps yeah we made moves we had no support thank you for that but we got hooked up with a minor gang of blanks run by this guy named Bobby Blaine he's a kind of a local hitter in that world anyway we promised him he could be the head bloodsucker of LA just as long as he gives up all his friends so you know pretty standard RICO stuff but even though it seemed like a good plan it was not where is this Bobby Blaine now oh he's dead and I mean really dead we got caught in the middle of some kind of Fang war and then they got wind of us and they burned through him his holdings he's [ __ ] memories everything and then threw us in for good measure that's where you lost your whole team good agents just good people and they get burned to death in that [ __ ] vamp cult S&M Club or whatever it was the other shot noir one of the blanks started the fire no no I started the fire I had to do something okay they got caught and I couldn't take the idea of them being turned you have to understand what they can do to us if they catch us you do know don't you they make us into them I could not let that happen to my people they're better off dead and they would tell you the same [ __ ] thing what happened to them do you have surveillance on one of them the ones that took down Blaine no no I have no idea you know maybe they died in the fire too look all I know is once Jankowski and Wilson died I got the [ __ ] out of there okay I mean completely off the grid I paid cash for cheap hotel rooms I used exclusively burner phones I started living out of [ __ ] trash cans because that's what you do when you're burned now I got no idea if those blanks are still Undead or whatever but hey bright side is they have no idea that I'm alive either I want to believe you Greg but if you wanted out you could have got out of LA on the first bus that you're still in the game know that you're too good and if you're willing to sacrifice your own people you've got at least one of these blank bodies under surveillance you had your out you chose to stay in that's a very good thing agent you did your job oh [ __ ] you and your job but you think you can turn it off Greg you want a bus you always have been and you always will be now what do you have for me I got one group I've been keeping tabs on a kind of an emerging power in the night scene but I've been keeping my distance all right what have you got Greg where's the file look forget Special Affairs first light is the real deal okay we've got power we're expanding globally even the Vatican listen you and I both know that these things threaten everything everything that's important to us okay so help me help me help you out of the cold help me take them down hello Fiona good work agent we'll be in touch so I am maybe shamefully a little bit behind on technology I need to know how to make a self-contained repository of information that only certain people can access that is completely act proof well that's not really what I do I feel like you've been misinformed slightly but I will say if you have a we call them computers now I don't know how long it's been okay if you have a computer and you have all the data that's on it you can have that data reside both on the computer and somewhere else so let's say your home computer gets destroyed for whatever reason or it gets left behind if you're on the move you could still access the data that was on the computer through a service like the one that we provide so instead of having a contained thing with all the information in it it's in two places that's right which is the opposite I think of what you're going for yes but what if I told you that it's added utility if it's in more than one place so if you have all the data in one place where only you can get it yeah that may as well be your brain but if you want to use that data somewhere else then having it in two places can be beneficial I see especially if you can access it from wherever you are in the world as long as you have access to the Internet that does sound interesting continue yes so when you have all this data that you're putting on your computer and then you want it to be somewhere else use it a program like Backblaze back-back blades right well take the data that's on the computer whilst securely in our cloud and then wherever you are if you so choose to get the data back you log in to our website okay and you can get that data back on to any computer or mobile device that you're using at the moment it doesn't really answer my question not quite but if you want to try it you can go to Backblaze comm slash la by night you can start a free trial there thank you you're welcome hello kindred its you have with back please go to Backblaze calm / la by night insert your free trial tonight [Music] Oh [Music]
