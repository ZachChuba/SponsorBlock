this is a 2006 my box 62 and it was the ultimate luxury sedan 15 years ago and i mean the ultimate luxury sedan this had a sticker price of over a half million dollars back in 2006 and you were meant to buy this car and ride in the back while your chauffeur drove you around today i'm going to review this amazing my box 62 and i'll show you everything [Music] only on cars and bids at carsandbids.com so let's talk maybach back in the early 2000s bmw bought rolls-royce then volkswagen and audi bought bentley and so mercedes-benz decided that they too needed an ultra luxury brand to compete with their german rivals so they went way back into their heritage and revived mybach which had been an ultra luxury brand name from decades earlier then in the mid-2000s they created this the mybox 62 there was also a shorter wheelbase model called the mybach57 which i have already reviewed but the 62 was the one to have the long wheelbase mybach with all of the luxury features and equipment like i said this car had a sticker price of over a half million dollars back when it was new and this one has some truly amazing features which are almost unbelievable it also has a twin turbo v12 with 550 horsepower about 650 pound-feet of torque and today i'm going to show you all of it first i'll take you on a tour of this mybach and show you all of its amazing quirks and features then i'll get it out on the road and drive it and then i'll give it a dug score all right i'm going to start the crux and features of the mybox 62 in the back because that's where you want to be and one interesting thing is the door in back is absolutely huge totally massive it looks like twice the size of the front door now like i said this is the long version of the maybach the shorter one had a more normal rear door but for the long version all of the stretch was added in the back seat to optimize rear comfort and that meant a massive door and one crazy thing about this door when you open it you can see it opens basically 90 degrees all the way as far as humanly possible and of course the thinking there was dresses this is a chauffeur-driven car people will be taking it to weddings climbing out in wedding dresses or to galas and climbing out in ball gowns and you need to have the entire dress be able to clear the door opening when the chauffeur opens the door and that is why it opens so wide in the back of the mybox 62. but anyway next you climb into the mybach and there are some truly unbelievable features back here starting with the door which closes automatically you press this little button on the ceiling and then the door closes you don't have to do anything i thought that feature was only on newer rolls-royce models but it was on the mybach as well a power closing rear door since it opened so far you couldn't really reach out to open it yourself but that is nowhere near the coolest feature back here that honor might go to the rear partition in between the front seats and the back seats there is a huge divide in terms of wealth status class but also there is a physical divider a partition you press this little button in the center console and back and you can raise a window literally separating the front seat occupants from the rear seat occupants so that your driver cannot hear your conversations which is a pretty interesting feature but then you might be wondering how exactly do you communicate with the driver you're being driven around you want to change directions go somewhere different how do you speak to them well you could lower the partition or you could use the intercom press this button here and that actually projects your voice using a microphone and speakers into the front seat so you can talk to your driver take a listen to me speaking from the back with the partition up and the intercom on here goes hey everyone doug's the type of guy to sit in the back of my box and tell you to check out cars and bids okay but try it without the microphone now hello everyone hello everyone this is doug quirks and features okay that's pretty cool but while the driver can respond using their intercom after they've been called by the rear seat passenger the driver cannot start a conversation using the intercom because then they would be interrupting the rear seat passenger so if you're driving along with the partition up and the driver has a question for the rear seat passenger the driver presses their intercom button and it rings back here like a telephone and then you can decide if you want to answer take a listen to the ringing and of course if you do answer your driver's call then you can speak on the microphone on the intercom system and you can talk with the partition up and you can use this little dial back here to adjust the volume of the intercom sound when you're sitting in back in case you can't hear the driver and you want to turn it up that is pretty cool but let's say you don't want to be interrupted by the driver or anyone this is the perfect car for it you can be in a complete cocoon back here because there are thick curtains all around you that you can close check this out press this little button and you close the curtains on the rear windows on the doors and they close that's not that uncommon but you also have a curtain on the back window that you can close you can see it's starting to become something of a cocoon in this car and there's even a curtain on the partition that you can close and once you close that then the driver can't even see in and you even have a little curtain on this tiny triangle window next to the seats it can be closed and that way no one can see in through any window and you can truly be in a complete cocoon of privacy as you're being chauffeured along in your my buck that is pretty cool but we are still not at the coolest feature back here because i think that honor goes to this ceiling you look up and you see this ceiling and it looks like something you might find in a modern home but it's in your car this is a panoramic sunroof currently it is open but not really you can see the sun is sort of getting through but it's mostly just gray but if you press this button suddenly it becomes clear instantly but you press the button again and it goes back to being opaque you can't see through it anymore and you press the button again and now it's clear and opaque and you can go back and forth deciding whether or not you want to have some light coming through your panoramic sunroof or whether you want to be a clear piece of glass that you can see out of like a normal sunroof you can make that determination at any time and you can also completely close the sunroof if you want press this little button and a sun shade closes up over the sunroof and makes it completely dark back here so you can really choose between three different stages of light coming through the sunroof depending on your current mood the owner of this car tells me this panoramic roof was over 50 000 as an option back when this car was new and what an incredible option it was but there's still so much more to cover in the back seat of this car i'm gonna go to the door panel next and you can see all of your seat controls back here including you have heated seats and cooled seats in the back that's pretty special you also have a massaging seat control to the side of the seat you can use this to turn on your seat massagers for the back seats which is very rare but not surprising in a car like this even more impressive though is the fact that this seat can fully recline press this button and then you can see the seat goes into its most reclined comfortable relaxed position and then you are basically laying down in the back of your my box 62 while you're being chauffeured around that is pretty cool and with the seat recline you can see the foot rest has popped out and even this popped out foot rest has carpeting on it because every surface of this car is fine materials and well thought out and well executed and excellent attention to detail and speaking of that foot rest these seat controls on the door even have their own control for just that foot rest so if you don't want to recline the seat but you want your foot rest out you press this little button and the foot rest can go wherever you want it because that's the level of luxury we have here and the door panel delivers with two more rather interesting items for one open up this panel press this button it falls gracefully open and you can see there's this mybach thing in here it has a myback logo on it what is this it's a mirror you open it up and you can see a mirror on one side and a slightly different magnification on the other side you have a mirror you have the same thing over on the passenger side so what's that about well in a normal my bike you have mirrors that fold down from the ceiling like you would have in the front with sun visors but if you get the panoramic sunroof in the maibox 62 you lose those visor mirrors so they give you these mybach branded handheld mirrors instead that is an incredibly cool quirk and speaking of cool quirks in the door panel like i said one more that would be open this panel and there are headphones in here not just regular ones but mybach branded headphones again to increase your luxury there's no bows there's no sound system back here mybach is the only brand name you need and the crazy just keeps coming back here let's move into the center console between the seats in this top compartment you open it up and there are champagne glasses in here but you can see they're placed on their sides so where do you enjoy them back here well that would be on the picnic tables of course you lift up this center console lid you can see there is a leather strap of course leather you pull on that strap and then you unfurl the picnic tables open them up put them down open them and then you can see that's your picnic table to enjoy a drink or a meal or just type on your laptop or read while you're in your myback and obviously wood and aluminum line nothing back here is plastic it has to be the finest materials now in terms of a place to put your drinks you also have a compartment in this car that i can only describe as a magic trick okay check this out you pop open this little compartment between the seats and you can see there are a couple of little cutouts and that's where you're intended to put your champagne glasses that's no surprise pretty standard you obviously would want a place to secure them but if you push this compartment back in and press the second button then you have like cup holders with depth but i just showed you that earlier this same compartment has champagne holders that are basically flat so how did they do this how did one part of it mean cup holders i don't understand i truly think this is magic it seems amazing if any car would have a magic trick i suspect the my box 62 would be the one but anyway let's go back to this area between the seats between the backrests right below the compartment for your champagne glasses you have two compartments for your dvd player back here consider this sort of your av cabinet in the back of your my box 62 you pop these open it controls your dvd player and that controls the televisions in this car which you can see are mounted on the partition directly in front of the rear seats and when you turn on these televisions of course the mybach logo appears just to remind you precisely what you're writing in to control these televisions you use this remote control that comes with the car and you can choose which television you're controlling and then adjust various menus so you can watch whatever you want back here while listening on your mybach branded headphones and by the way speaking of technology back here worth noting that in this center console you open it up and you will find a telephone back here looks like an old school motorola sort of handset thing i guess you would get a telephone hooked up to somehow and then you could speak to the world no surprise to see that in the back of a car like this it would almost be surprising not to see it and speaking of things that you'd be surprised not to see where is the refrigerator cars like this tend to have a refrigerator where is the one in the maibok it is not in between the seats this last compartment here is just a little storage compartment nothing special instead it is in the center console you lift up the console and there is the refrigerator rather large large enough of course for bottles of champagne to celebrate being a billionaire you're being driven around in the back of your my box and amazingly i am still not done with all of the incredible features back here another one on the seats you can see at the top you have a headrest which has a beautiful mybach logo on it but if you want more comfort the car also comes with a fluffy pillow and you can attach that to the headrest and you have an even fluffier more relaxing experience for your head and speaking of improving your rear seat experience of course you have your own climate controls back here one for each seat dual zone in the back no surprise the surprising thing is the climate vents they are not just tiny vents hidden in little spots that barely bring air to you instead you have real climate vents back here one here on the ceiling above the door another one on the partition again a large climate vent like you might have in the front and you also have more climate vents in the center on this other center console near where your feet are so you really do get the full effect of climate control back here not just like two crappy little vents that they hope will do the job and amazingly still not done with all the incredible features back here it really is wild in the back of this car but anyway in the front part of this compartment on the ceiling you can see three gauges you may have seen them earlier over on the right the gauge tells you the current temperature outside no surprise in the middle that's a clock it tells you the current time and over on the left it is a speedometer a second speedometer after the one in the driver's gauge cluster so while you're sitting back here you can always monitor your driver's speed if you think he's going a little too fast just use your intercom and tell them to slow down and next up we move on to the front seat of the mybox 62 but from the moment you open the front door you can tell this is not a car intended for the driver it really is intended for the rear seat occupant in case you couldn't tell from all that luxury stuff i say that because there's just not all that much space up here you can see the partition intrudes into the front seat area and the seat is currently as far back as it goes and it's just not really all that far back in fact i'm sitting here and you can see my knees are basically brushing up against the underside of the dashboard next to the steering wheel there's just not that much space in the front of this car despite how huge it is instead all the space is reserved for the people in back because they were the ones spending the money on the car but even though this car was rear focused there is still some amazing stuff up front for instance press this little button where you'd expect the glove box to be and this compartment drops and a phone rises out of the dashboard and presents itself to you automatically obviously the actual phone is long gone and it would be incredibly outdated technology by now anyway but that must have been the coolest party trick in the world 15 years ago a phone rising from your dashboard at the push of a button that's pretty intense obviously the other button on the other side of this is the glove box you press that the glove box opens and it reveals the largest owner's manual you will ever see at any capacity ever frankly that's not surprising there was a lot to cover with this car and the owner's manual covers it all but speaking of stuff that pops out how about this little wood compartment behind the shift lever you open this up and there are some coiled up things in here you push and that's a front cup holder it pops out reveals itself and then you can put a drink in it and when you're done you can store it right back in this little wood compartment so you don't have to have cup holders in your face at all times now also in this little wood compartment you have a few switches in here these are the controls for your rear curtains again all of the curtains for rear compartment can be controlled right here now i showed you before the rear seat passenger has access to those same controls but if they don't even want to lift a finger to close the curtains you can use the intercom called the driver please close my curtains and the driver can do it for you that is a luxurious touch and the driver has other controls for the rear seat passengers back here you have a sunroof control in the normal place where you'd see a sunroof control on the ceiling next to the rearview mirror except there's no sunroof over these front seats that is the control to open or close the rear panoramic sunroof sunshade it can be done up here again if the person sitting in back doesn't want to do it themselves they can ask the driver and it will be done for them and some other interesting controls in here how about on the door panel where the seat memory is you have five different seat memory controls most cars have two maybe three this has five because if you have different drivers maybe they work different shifts different chauffeurs you want different seat memories for each one so they can all program the seat to the position that makes them the most comfortable and also on the door panel check this out you push this little black button and a compartment opens up gracefully and it reveals a cd storage slot so you don't have to worry about storing your cds in some compartment where they'll crash around and get scratched you have them at easy reach right at your fingertips in the door panel in a dedicated slot pretty cool next up something i always loved about the interior of these my box they have about the same steering wheel as many mercedes models from this era the s-class and others but one big difference the steering wheel buttons are wood instead of plastic a regular s-class had the same buttons the same steering wheel but they were black plastic these are wood everything in this car is either wood trim or chrome or some sort of carpeting even the plastic steering wheel buttons are trimmed to look like wood to make that experience even more luxurious and truthfully that attention to detail is all throughout this car pretty much everywhere you look i showed you a lot of those luxury features in back but even the littlest things like for example the font used in the gauge cluster you can see this beautiful upscale mercedes-benz font gorgeous and they've used that to emphasize this car's luxury and gracefulness with a matching font you also have beautiful wood trim everywhere up front including this three level wood trim that starts on the door panel and then goes into the dashboard and it just looks great very distinctive different from a lot of other stuff i've seen in cars these like three levels of wood looks cool another great piece of attention to detail is the sun visor you drop the sun visor you have a visor mirror of course like most cars but you also have a second magnification of visor mirror you can choose two different ways to look at yourself depending on the zoom that you want that's pretty impressive and speaking of the crazy luxury here let's start this car before i do that i want to show you the key fairly standard mercedes-benz key except on the reverse you have the mybach logo of course they wouldn't just give you mercedes benz they wanted everything to be bespoke to the mailbox but anyway you start the car turn it on and it is unbelievable how quiet it is when you're first starting it you do not hear the engine like you do in so many other cars you can barely tell that this thing is running or hear the starter going to start the engine incredibly incredibly quiet no surprise given this car's market position same deal with the door locks by the way you press this little button in the center console to lock or unlock the doors and when they lock and unlock they don't make that door lock sound you're used to hearing instead nothing silent take a listen to the doors locking and unlocking in this car but anyway next i want to move outside to my back and i want to talk styling which was this car's greatest failing i say that because it looks like an s-class which is too bad because nothing on the outside of this car is shared with the mercedes s-class of its day nothing every single panel and piece and part of this design was unique to the mybach but it simply looked a lot like the s-class and frankly that really was this car's greatest feeling they created a truly bespoke ultra luxury incredibly expensive opulent sedan and then somehow they managed to make it look like a car that cost way less money a big mistake and in my opinion a big contributor to this car's eventual failure that and the economic recession the fact that it just wasn't distinctive enough think about the rolls-royce phantom and how clearly identifiable that car is you didn't have that with the mybach which just looked like a big s-class one crazy thing about this car is these wheels these are not s-class wheels distinctive special mybach wheels but they look just like this s-class wheel from the era and a quick glance you wouldn't even know that it's different but it was they just made it look the same what a mistake with that said there were some clearly identifiable differences between the maybach and the regular s-class this day one big one is this rear light bar going around the back the regular x-class did not have it you could always tell when you were behind a maybach if you saw this giant tail light in back it was something a little different a little bigger another way to tell apart the maybach from the s-class most of them were two-tone you can see this one is dark blue on the top and light blue on the bottom you couldn't do that in a regular s-class but you could in the maybach and most people did it was a very distinguishing very opulent feature two-tone instead of normal one-tone paint like a plebian the other big way you could tell apart the maybach from an s-class honestly was just how big this car is it's difficult to convey it when i'm standing here when it's parked with no real frame of reference but this thing is huge and when you see these on the street you can instantly tell it is wider it is taller it is longer it is a huge car compared to the s-class of its day when they were parked right next to each other it didn't look a thing like the s-class you knew you were looking at something totally different it's just a shame the styling was pretty much the same and next up few more notable items about the maybach one is the pronunciation which is right here this is the correct way to say it my bach anybody who says maybach or maybach or my back it's all wrong my bach is correct people have tried to correct me about this before but they are wrong the germans say mybach and that is the way you're supposed to say it despite how it might be spell now one other exterior item i want to talk about is on the roof in the back you have the big sunroof of course in the front you have solar panels which is pretty cool the intent of these solar panels was that they would get sunlight obviously and then the panels would power the climate control system and keep fresh air blowing in the car even when it was turned off and that is pretty cool you climbed inside the maybach after had been sitting in the sun for a while and the air wouldn't feel so stale because you have fresh air blowing in periodically thanks to the solar panels but anyway we move on to the trunk next you open it up and it pops open automatically of course you can see nothing really special back here actually it's just a trunk and frankly kind of a small one given this car size all of the focus in this car was really put into the back seat area and so the trunk and the front seats kind of lost out a little bit in terms of sizing with that said there is one interesting item worth noting in the trunk on the bottom of the trunk lid you can see this strip here is chrome every other mercedes-benz model from this era it was plastic because it's the bottom of the trunk lid and who cares but for a maybach they know you will see it periodically when the trunk is up so it has to be chromed everything has to look great no matter how small of a detail and how infrequently you will see it that's a pretty cool touch and finally we move under the hood in the my bike you open the hood you can see the engine twin turbo v12 with this cover on top with the mybach logo of course this car had about 550 horsepower and about 650 pound-feet of torque impressive figures now admittedly this was the same v12 used in the top level s-class at the time this is the biggest component that the two cars shared but they weren't going to develop a whole new v12 just for the maybach and it was more than adequate as an engine although later mybach models did get even more power than this offered over 600 horses and almost 750 pound-feet of torque but i feel like this was more than adequate even in spite of this car's massive size and so those are the quirks and features of the mybach 62. now it's time to get it out on the road and see how it drives all right driving the 62. this thing is so baller it is so ridiculous and opulent and crazy if you know what to look for you know i mentioned this already in the video but most people just don't know i have spent the last day basically because there's so many quirks filming this car in a public parking lot people coming going whatever not a single person walked up to which is very rare um especially with a special car but this isn't a car that most people think is special it's just an old mercedes so first thing i noticed driving this car uh unbelievably tight up front just incredible i'm like six foot three six foot four and it is hard up here i have the seat all the way back and my knees are up against the dashboard it truly was built for the rear seat passengers and the funny thing is a couple more inches would have been nice and it wouldn't have really mattered back there like there's so much space back there that i can lie down and have room but this car was all about the rear seat and the driver didn't really matter all that much if you wanted a mybach that you could drive they had the 57 the shorter wheelbase model which had more room in front but that wasn't the point of this one this was the serious car and these were incredibly rare mercedes was selling i think like 100 or 150 of these in the us a year incredibly small and the 62 was like 20 of sales like no one everyone bought the short wheelbase it was way cheaper this was just a very very special vehicle so the driving experience unbelievably comfortable in this car just tremendously so um you hear nothing nothing happening on the outside i should have mentioned it this car has these double-paned windows with like black trim around the edge where they like grip the panes together oh god it is beautifully quiet in here just so so calm and serene unbelievably so especially for a car from 2006. now one thing about this car is it is pretty big although you don't really notice the size while you're driving it all that much it doesn't drive huge it's a big car in the sense that it has a big engine that's not really tuned for performance so it's kind of lumbery as a car like you accelerate it's not necessarily what i would call fast but it certainly it has power but that's not what it's tuned for like it's intended to be a slow building relaxing engine increasing in power the performance is something it's very nice it has a lot of torque so anytime you put your foot down you are going but it does take the transmission a second or two to gear down because that's all comfort based it's it's there's no shift there's no like you don't feel shifting in this car it just sort of happens in the background it really is nice it really does feel like you're wafting around in one of the most luxurious cars even by modern standards 15 years after this car came out this still feels more comfortable and quieter than modern like s-classes like nice luxury sedans this is even better than them the ride quality especially is better it's unbelievable going over bumps and speed bumps especially you feel almost nothing it is so incredibly smooth and comfortable in here obviously like the infotainment tech is nowhere near the modern era and you know the buttons in switchgear you look around and it's starting to kind of get feel a little bit old but for its purpose which was just pure luxury it still feels like pure luxury really this is the one you want to be driven in there's no question about it and i think part of the problem with the 62 selling was not that many people want to be driven here in north america it's just not a common thing like it is in some other places like in asia and europe to an extent um it's it's outside of new york city there's not that many people with a driver and so these just didn't really sell all that well but man if you had a driver sitting back there playing with the sunroof closing yourself in in the curtains it would be everything overall i must say i'm pretty impressed by this car it's been about four years since i drove on my back i did a 57s video my three four years ago and that was impressive but the 62 was on a totally different level it feels about the same in terms of comfort and luxuriousness and all that but the back seat stuff in the 62 i mean it was a car that was truly built for ultra ultra luxury people the 57 was ultra luxury people but the 62 was an even different level from that and this car feels it it really does and so that's the mybox 62. this was truly a limo that you could buy for yourself hire someone to drive you around and impress anyone who really knows luxury this car was not as in your face as a rolls-royce phantom but it was every bit as luxurious and as expensive and i am thrilled to have this amazing car on cars and bids anyway now it's time to give this mybach a doug score starting with the weekend categories and styling the 62 is fine but not amazing the lack of an individual style over the s-class is its biggest issue and it gets a 4 out of 10. acceleration to 0-60 in the low 5-second range and it gets a 5 out of 10. handling isn't sharp nor is it intended to be this is a big car and have soft suspension to maximize ride comfort and it gets a 3 out of 10. fun factor is ok the fun of this car is sitting in back not driving in and it gets a 4 out of 10. finally cool factor and that's much higher my head turns all the way around when i see a mybox 62 on the road which is never that long wheelbase as these ultra luxury sedans go this has to be one of the coolest and it gets a 7 out of 10 for a total weekend score of 23 out of 50. next up are the daily categories and features this car has some good modern tech but mostly it has amazing amenities in back and it gets a 7 out of 10. comfort is a mixed bag the ride quality is amazing just as good as a modern s-class if not better but front seat comfort isn't great because it's tight up front rear seat comfort of course is truly incredible i'll split the difference at 8 out of 10. quality is nice enough and it gets a 7 out of 10. practicality is fine it has tons of room which should bump up this score but it's also too big to like park anywhere and it gets a 5 out of 10. finally value and these are a fraction of their original price but they're still relatively expensive given the aging tech it gets a 6 out of 10 for a total daily score of 33 out of 50. added up and the doug score is 56 out of 100 which places it here against similar cars the 62 easily beats out the maibok 57s i tested the 62 is simply more special and more exciting period the 62 does well in this company though i haven't yet tested its closest rival a rolls royce phantom from this era you
