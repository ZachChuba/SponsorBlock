hey how's it going welcome back to another episode of the ultimate Ironman and we start off the last video by doing a bunch of fishing at minnows and we got our stack of no jerks up to over 10,000 of them so I think it's pretty safe to say that will be set for PVM and then last video we also finally went back into the wildy and finally got the tasks done that I've been putting off for so long but killing Callisto Venna natus and Betty on and it feels so relieving to have that done I've been like kind of stret not really stressed but it's pretty much just been eating away in the back of my mind since I stopped doing it and gave up a couple months ago at this point but now we have it done we have two tasks left to go and fish and cook a dark crab in the resource area now let me tell you what I want to work on this video so the first thing being working towards the 90 cooking so in a little bit here I'll be showing you the method I'll be doing for training cooking and we'll slowly and truly get there and that's what I'll be doing during the day I'll be trained cooking during the day and then at night we're gonna be killing the chaos elemental and speaking of training miss any truly epic gaming moments for those of you that didn't know there is a stash unit for the dragon pickaxe it's a master stash unit it's the one by the Seoul altar and you store the deep pick along with the nezzie and ruin boots with it so not only can we store the deep pick but we'll also be set for that master clue if we're able to get the dragon pickaxe which it's a 1 out of 256 drop from Kaos le so it could take some time you know we could be done in one day it could take us 2 or 3 weeks to get it but unless something goes terribly wrong with Castelli it's just like not doable to kill then we're gonna keep on going until we get the pick I might want to go for the pick and the pet it just depends like you know how orangey goes but I do want to commit to at least getting one of those if not hopefully both of them the pets want to have 300 by the way I was up to like 5 a.m. last night with a homies just kind of messing around I mean besides doing the bully stuff there's just a lot of fun you know if you don't tuck the homies into bed are they really your homies but yeah it's a morning time right now so we're not gonna be starting Castelli but we're gonna be doing the cooking method first so let me prepare for that and I'll show you how we're gonna be trained cooking over the course of next couple weeks or could be one day could be two weeks like I said we'll see how long it takes us to get something from Kaos deli I guess now that I think about there really is no prep that we have to do I guess we have to get the Mauretania legs that's the only thing for the birdie rat teleport with the Mauretania like 3 or the hard diary done you can use the teleport on the legs we have mauritania legs for it which yeah I mean that's even better so we're gonna teleport to birdy rot and this is a method that I don't think I've seen any other UI M's post in any other videos so this could be a first for the tubes but we're gonna run over here to the general store and this guy Orel it's such a weird name this guy Orel sells 10 raw thin snails and 10 raw mackerels and they're pretty cheap - maybe I should probably grab a little bit more money but all you need for this is 20 free inventory slots open because his stock is 10 on every world so we're gonna buy 10 and 10 and then we're gonna run a couple houses down over here and there's an everlasting fire very very conveniently so I mean you can see where this is going from here we're just gonna cook the mackerels those give 60 XP each and then we're also gonna cook these snails apparently those give 70 XP each this is a method that I've never done before I've heard of it but I've never tried it out let me reset the cooking XP tracker to a lot of you probably know the method with using the : arrow man through his chest and making lines out of that that I believe is 150 K per hour assuming you have all of our FD done and then each time you finish cooking an inventory just top Roald's and i don't think any world would ever be bought out like there's no reason anyone would ever be buying this food here you know can we sell it back to the shop I'm not sure about that oh we can oh dude this is freaking amazing I love this dude I really like this a lot already no dropping involved there's a plug-in I'm gonna use that should help a little bit and if you didn't know already every single plug-in and feature within room light is fully compliant with jagex rules but what I'm going to do is use the plug-in NPC indicators and then I'm gonna add or roll it's such a weird name dude add oral onto that list there and then we run over here you will be blue on the map so that way I could just like click from far away over here not have to squint and zoom in and try it harder to see him literally this right here is the reason why I love playing you I am because who the hell would think of this method you know but I'm gonna test out one hour of doing this actually before we do that I'm gonna grab out maybe like 300k or something just so we don't have to worry about taking out money in the middle of the hour I'll know how much we'll go through but I guess we can do like a before and after and see how much money we spend in the hour as well so we got 316 K and 73 GP oh yeah we're also starting with 17 cooking because we got 74 rft a long long long time ago and we have not trained it since this has been the lowest skill on the account and it's finally time that our tears can start going is something new I haven't done tears of guthix since before doing our FD for the same reason because there's no point doing that when cooking is the lowest skill it's not worth the time is as you all know cooking is such a fast skill I had to get graceful from the house because my run was depleting too fast but it seems like with graceful my run remains pretty much about the same thing the whole entire time like the end of each trip I'll be at the same run amount left if you really want to be efficient with cooking I think this works for ant and cook you can do this right here you feel like one take the last food that you cook on the fire I know it's really stupid but some people do it I guess it kind of defeats the purpose of just afk cooking though you know if you're just cooking fish on a fire or range or something if you want to actually pay attention you would just you want to cram ones I don't think I want to do this method actually it's only been half an hour but I really don't want to spend the rest of the time finishing up this hour let me put the XP up on screen here so we're averaging about 60 K XP per hour you can see it's been about half an hour now so it's definitely not gonna be changing it's pretty bad and comparing this method to doing wines there are pros and cons of course with the con being wines are a lot more XP per hour whereas the pros of this method being that it's more afk there's no competition because the grapes can get packed with people sometimes I don't know how bad exactly it is but I know you share stocks with other people or other iron men or something and with this method you get to be unique because who else is gonna do this method so if you want to stream this method and people would be like wow you're an ultimate iron man doing cool methods but yeah I'm done with this method I probably won't do it again unless I really really need to afk I'm gonna go step for wines I'll show you how we're doing that and then we'll test one hour of making wine oh yeah another thing about that snail method is that it's cheaper too looks like we went through about 6 K 5 or 6 kg pee in that half hour so it's probably about just over 10 kg P per hour whereas with this method we have to buy astral runes 1 astral room will give us the equivalent of 2 K cooking exp so by that logic if we do end up getting 150 k XP per hour it'll be 75 astral runes per hour so we'll start out with a few hundred I guess and just see how the method is for a few hours I have the quest capes that we can teleport to the fairy ring and then use the fairy ring to gets the house fairy ring because we can't use the poh teleport on the lunar spell book but we need to humidify for this method i got the spell filtering on to so that way don't accidentally teleported out wait how do we get to Lumbridge if we're not on the wrigglers like dammit I didn't think that far ahead once we were able to upgrade the nexus and we have plenty of money to spend well by all the teleports from the nexus but for the moment i do still want to save up for 99 construction alright so here's the method we're gonna go to buy food buy 10 grapes buy 10 jug cast humidify the tomah fire counts as unlimited fire runes for combat spells which is why it works and it doesn't use up charges unless you're using a combat spell and then we're gonna make the wines wait 12 seconds after we make them for them to ferment in this downtime right here while we're waiting we could be training fletching if we had broad arrows to make there's probably a couple other things like maybe fletching darts or something but we don't have any of that stuff to make right now so then we're gonna drop these and then yeah we have to hop to each time because there's only 10 grapes so for this method we once again need 23 inventory spaces which we are very very lucky to have of course and yeah this is gonna be a pain with the grapes to really happen a lot of world I started on until you can't world which is why I had 10 in there but you know be a little bit annoying I guess in this downtime what we could do is just buy 10 more jugs and cast humidify before we had to minify we were running over to the sink over here and then filling up all the jugs one by one now we are very privileged to have this spell to use all right once we get this XP drop here it's gonna give us very iconic first level of this cooking grind 71 the first very very many more to come if we had more money I could just cast magic and view for the magic XP but it cost like between two to three GP / XP or so and yeah it's money they don't want to spend at the moment well cooking is no longer the lowest skill on the UI em that award now goes to fletching I think ideally I'd want to have prayer as the lowest skill while prayer or boar I guess the next one will be room craft once we get cooking and fletching up yeah there is 72 Oh sacred eels I might do that at some point if I really need to afk and like work on my mane or something in which I don't think that'd happen but just in case that afk option is available alright well it's pretty much been one hour of doing this method and it was 144 K in this hour of XP we got so a little bit less than I thought but dude because every single worlds like not at full stock that definitely lowers the XP traits by quite a bit by wand doing it this time I don't want to do it at midnight or whatever because that is going to be our chaos Ellie time comparing this method to the snails this is over double the XP per hour I think over the course of time I'll probably end up going down it's like 100k XP per hour but the thing about this method is I can play at half efficiency and still get more XP than playing at next efficiency doing the snails method so I'll probably just always do method I won't be going at two snails but that's what the series is all about it's about exploring the game learning new methods and figuring out new things that I would not have known about the game otherwise and I think that's all I have to say about this method so I will just be singing back with each level I get over the course of the next day or week or however long it takes to finish up with Castelli this will be our daily go-to thing all day long I really can't wait apparently I just died 73 74 75 so you I am bingo literally just started like an hour ago the first ever you I am bingo is last summer if you guys were called back the very beginning of this series I was like 800 total during the first you I am bingo so I was really new to the game mode but at this point I'm over 2k total so a lot has changed since then in the last was like six months I think I think was in May yeah just over six months I didn't originally sign up to be on the draft which was back in November so I wasn't even planning on being a part of bingo because my plan originally was to play twisted League which still ends like two weeks from now it's a January 2nd and the bingo last for two weeks so that was really bad timing but obviously at this point I'm not playing twisted League anymore and paternal from the jiggy Osler's invited me to their team because apparently someone dropped out and I was looking that bingo board which I'll put on screen now and there's really I told him there's no tiles I'll really be helping out with since I'll just be doing chaos I like the whole time I guess I kind of will be doing like cooking and stuff but everyone else is covering all those tiles so I told him that but apparently they don't care and they're fine with me being on the team even though I won't really be helping out with too much but yeah I'll keep you updated with how things go and how we're keeping up not to brag or anything but my team was 1st place in the very first year I am bingo just saying maybe we could keep that streak going let's go jigging Jos lairs jostle jostle jostle 76 77 78 all right it's been a fun day of training cooking but it's finally time to get set up for chaos le something to buy the Dragon scimitar back 400 K and I'm just setting everything up now allocating all the gear that we need and here's all the XP that we gained today almost a million cooking XP and I still managed to maintain a decent expiry to you so pretty happy with that because we have Dragon Slayer 2 done we can get the locator orb for free from of over here and what we just take as many as we want alright well we'll take one of them when you touch it each time I'll lower your hit points by 10 but you can't actually die with it you can only get down to one hit point and then we just pick one more nettle and then we die and because we're gonna be suiciding every like 45 or 50 minutes or something this is going to help save a lot of time especially because I'll have to death piles as you can see this account's is obviously not that uim but i want to show the method that we'll be doing for the chaos le so essentially we're just me safe spotting it and to safe spot it that involves learning it over to the west side near the resource area and then from there once you learn it into the right spot you can just stand there and attack it so I'll show you how that method goes to this entrance so bad right now this is such a bad time to be doing it's not actually gonna die you can't do anything once the whole connection loss screen comes back we're gonna being val-d'or camel eye or whatever cut why right now your watch watch we're gonna login let's see where we're at wow what a shocker I just did a speed test by the way it's definitely the server is not my internet kinda sucks maybe it's just a bad world right now so I won't use this world okay let's try this again so we're gonna run east till we see Castelli and I mean wanna learn all the way west so it might get stuck behind something so just like run around so it gets unwrapped from there and then if we want to run along this southern wall over here and it's gonna follow you and may get stuck behind stuff but in the end as long as you go to the southern wall and keep on running west it will follow you and there's the certain line of north-south tiles that you want to be on it's like six or seven tiles west of this tree right over here and if you go west of it the coselli will be a grow you so this very specific line of tiles is where you want to be and then once you see it we're gonna start running north and we still want to stay along this line of tiles if you get teleport that's really annoying because if your teleport West you got tried to re a grow it and then once we see it we're gonna go one tile to the west over here you actually walk and then from here it's in a safe spot and we just keep on hitting it as much as we would like to if we didn't okay I did this DC's gave me kind of nervous so I might attack options off we can just punch it from here and then yeah it won't attack us or do anything able to stay there and that's it that's how the method is gonna go so let's finish prepping on the uim and we're gonna fall on send it also gotta make a note to not go to this world because it's taking damage Oh finally we're 18 minutes into the death timer you finally got her first kill I guess in this case our second kill I probably won't be showing every kill but I'll just keep in touch whenever I feel a head kiss no wait we got the kill okay well that's fine I guess if we die here oh man it's kind of annoying well I brought the lockpick the most annoying part about this is just having to like get everything all everything all over again damn at least you can get the pet or anything there that live in the worst part alright oh we lost the locator or two it's also very annoying we have 9-mil GP in total so we'll see how much GP we have by the end of this by time you get to pick or pet or whatever we end up going for oh well there is a 20k see right there so far no luck okay it's getting kind of late right now I've been here for like three or four hours or something this will be the last trip for tonight we're at 24 minutes and so once we get to one hour or like 45 minutes or something we're going to call it for tonight tomorrow's Friday so I don't even know if I'll be coming back here tomorrow I might just wait till the weekend's over we'll see how it is though all right we're at 48 minutes now last kill the night all right so what I thought we got that 26 Casey now though so we got 25 kills tonight the nice thing about looting bags now is that the drop rate is based on each monster based on their combat level and for chaos Kelly because it's such a high level I think for all the ability bosses to it's a one out of three drop so we're pretty much guaranteed to get one every single trip so at the end of the night I'm ready to bag everything up we don't have to go out of the way to get the bag so that's one thing that's really nice about doing buildi stuff on the uym now all right well it's been a very interesting night and a night filled with some learning experiences I feel pretty confident with the boss on a weekend though I don't know how it's gonna be it might be really bad besides the one time I got t-kid I only saw like two or three other people run by and they were just like to include or wildy Slayer or something I was doing this on the 2k world so that probably helped a bit I mean if anything I feel like on a two camera I'd be more likely just to be Kraft by someone trying to kill chaos le rather than from a peak air and then as for the loot from 25 chaos elemental kills that is what we got nothing interesting at all from there I was doing this for about four hours in total so I guess it came out to about six kills per hour which is pretty much was expecting so I'm glad that I hit my expectations at the very least the looting bag is not looking too good right now we don't have too much space to store all these items I could just throw out all the items that I got today I actually got the dragon dagger as a drop I'll probably just send the balcony I don't really care that much about having the spec but I'll figure out in the morning or they wanted to do because right now it's too late I don't feel like thinking about anything so I'll just catch you back tomorrow then I guess later today peace okay I decided I'm gonna suicide to his spory so I don't have to worry about dropping all this gear just to have to get back in a couple days I decided I don't think I'll be doing it tonight or tomorrow night we'll probably go back Sunday night it is Friday by the way today if you didn't get that so we'll probably just spend all day cooking for the next couple days then because once again we do still need that what was at 90 cooking for the wildy elite Diaries so hopefully we'll get very close to that over the next couple days hey I was taking the items out of here and before I took out too much I just noticed we hit a 100 mill net value on the ultimate iron man that's kind of a cool accomplishment right okay we are now stocked up on astral runes I'm ready to go and have a nice chill couple of days without any of the stress of the wilderness we're looking real cute right now to kind of a variety of Jimmy for some reason anyways we're starting with 78 cooking and I'll see you back with each level I didn't even notice you're about to hit this until just a couple inventories ago but there's a hundred and fifty million total like speed 79 cookin and there's level 80 cooking we can now cook shark so we're now pretty much PV I'm ready for once we finish with all this really stuff and start doing serve we're good now we have 10,000 sharks maybe I'll even use the Sharks for doing chaos alley because that way I'll save a little bit of time instead of having to go to the Warriors guild for the cheesy potatoes plus it's better food oh yeah a tea cooking's also for the candor and elite diary it's like fish and cook five sharks for that 81-82 and there is 83 cooking that is the halfway point to level 90 and I decided that ninety cooking will be the goal for this video since it is the weekend we will have all weekend to Train cooking and that is what 2.7 million go so that's about 20 hours maybe just over 20 hours of training cooking so we should be able to get that done Sunday night or something and then next video will have all week to go kill the Castelli and hopefully we could snag it sometime next week but I'm not gonna get my hopes up but you will have plenty time because right now the player counts is pretty high it is night time it's like 11 p.m. but there's still like 65,000 people online right now which is kind of high so we're gonna continue on with cooking and I will keep on updating you with each level I'm pretty sure today's the second day of training cooking we started with 70 cooking yesterday and I can't believe we're like almost 84 cooking at this point I'm gonna call a day for day number two cooking we got 1 point 1 million cook next Pete's a little bit of magic XP I did spend a little bit of time crafting doing Terra ships because I felt like it for a bit but yeah I'm gonna save the level for the morning because gang a level in the morning is a great way to start the day good morning gamer starting off strong 84 cooking Oh angler fish oh that's for a current elite you have to catch them cookin angler fish I'm pretty sure all the bingo teams have their own discord servers and for the bingo team I'm on this is probably my favorite Channel and our discord server the good morning good night channel such positive vibes man I just love the camaraderie within here all right gamers let's get this bread 85 cooking is what we need for wild pies and that is a requirement for desert elite to bake a wild pie 8687 all right another day of cooking is over with and here's the games for today tomorrow we are gonna finish off 90 cooking where I think it's about 1 mill XP to go we're almost four point three mill yeah I think it's almost exactly 1 Milich speak and as usual I will save the next level for the morning gamers 88-89 the final stretch begins that's like probably four to five more hours no this is not okay until we get 90 cooking all right once we get this XP drop in just a few more seconds here we're finally gonna be done with cooking for a while there we go 90 cooking we can now do the wildy elite diary because we have to cook a dark crab at the fish and cook a dark crab of course we do have the fishing level for that and we will be getting the wildy elite diary done in the next video I'm really glad to have done this method over mess hall because do mess hall is not fun it's not afk and all it is slightly better XP per hour but this is better for me for the long term in order to not burn out alright now for the XP we gained we gained about a hundred and twenty thousand magic XP and then the cookin XP who is almost 4.6 million XP this is taken about almost 40 hours yeah probably close to 40 hours because over the course of time I did go down to like one to one cake cooking expiry I'd say overall 120 K per hours but I got especially with the world's being sold out that's what made it most annoying because it could be like midday and all the world's would be fully stocked it just matters have one or two other people are doing this method then it's just messed up for everyone but if you're the only one doing it and it's midday it's fine or it could be 2 a.m. and there could be 3 people doing it and just every world sold out so it doesn't really matter what time of day you do it just gotta hope no one else is doing that we are done training cooking for a while but you will eventually have to get 95 for the Diary Cape that's the highest requirement so later on eventually once we get grapes from zora that's when we'll be training cooking again but we're set for a while I'm honestly just 190 for the diary requirement it's Sunday evening at the moment as I'm recording this so we'll start off the next video by doing something just kind of chill afk for a bit while we wait for it to get a little bit later but Sunday night so we are gonna be getting back into cast elemental and next video will be grinding out Cass elemental all week or for a couple weeks or however long it takes to get d pic or Pat unless I just get really frustrated because I'm not gonna keep on doing it if I'm not enjoying it you know because that's what games are all about it's about having fun and with that said thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed and I hope that you have a great day and I'll see you again next time
