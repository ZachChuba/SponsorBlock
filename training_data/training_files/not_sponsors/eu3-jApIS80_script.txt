I made a rather esoteric video at the start of the year when I didn't really have any subscribers which was a tribute to the excellent primitive technology YouTube channel because I was demonstrating something called primitive reflexes so it was really just a bad pun because it was in the primitive technology style the video was silent with all the information conveyed via subtitles and it was kind of experimental in my defense I didn't really think anyone would be watching but the channels got a bit bigger since then and I've had quite a lot of comments saying please could I remake the video with more conventional narration but what I thought might be more fun is to actually revisit to see how reflexes have changed over the subsequent months so I'm very pleased to invite my patient back onto the channel and he's kindly agreed although he has claimed all ad revenue from both this video and the previous one due to unlicensed copyright infringement so please welcome patient be back onto the channel or to give this full name case Francis control welcome to the channel I normally treat adult patients so it's quite uncommon for them to sit on my lap although not unheard of so what actually is a reflex well put simply it's an involuntary response to a stimulus I made a pretty long video about the most well known reflex the knee jerk which is a classic example of a mitotic reflex arc the tendon hammer strikes the knee stimulates a stretch receptor sensory neuron which communicates directly with a motor neuron and makes the quadriceps muscles contract the brain is not involved with that at all however the reflexes I'm talking about today are much more complicated than that they do involve the brain but at a subconscious level and I don't think we give them enough credit stuff like how your body maintains blood pressure or its temperature something is apparently simple as blinking or more complex ones like one I talked about in detail in a video I made about free divers they died reflux the reason I made that first video is because while there quite a few videos online explaining how to examine for primitive reflexes because they form part of a routine medical examination on a baby that a doctor would do but I didn't find any explaining what primitive reflexes actually are and why they're so special we treat new one babies as stupid and they totally are but have you ever stopped to consider for a second how amazing it is that they have these complicated mechanisms all ready to go hardwired into their brain from day one mechanisms designed to maximize their chance of survival and how incredible it is that we share so many of these with our mammalian cousins a newborn chimp human or even a dog have so much in common how anybody can observe that and deny that we evolved from a common ancestor he is beyond me primitive reflexes is the name given to a set of behaviors that a newborn baby will exhibit which gradually disappear as they get older why do we examine babies for primitive reflexes well to ensure normal neurological development the absence of a reflex when it should be there an exaggerated reflex or one that persists when it should have gone are all signs of delayed or otherwise abnormal neurology the first reflex is the Moro it's sometimes referred to as the mother of all reflexes it appears as early as 25 weeks gestation in the womb and it's closely associated with our fight flight fright response it's normally tested by allowing the baby to safely experience the sensation of falling Moro himself after whom it's named used to hit babies around the side of the head we don't do that anymore it's also triggered by anything that gives the baby a start off for example a loud noise but because babies are stupid they often also trigger it themselves for no apparent reason and indeed this is one of the reasons for swaddling and newborn baby is to prevent themselves waking up from sleep with a Moro stupid babies perhaps that's a little unfair suggested that myoclonic jerks that we all get as we're falling asleep might indeed be a related phenomenon the morrow is a really fascinating reflex it should be symmetric and disappear by about six months now if I try to elicit a Moro on patient V he has spent almost as long so the womb as he did inside and because both of my sons have inherited an adrenaline-junkie gene no idea where I get that from he now positively enjoys being flung about the place yeah that didn't sound quite right please don't call social services one theory is it because the full morrow consists of not only the arms going out but then coming back in is that it might assist baby if it falls off mama to then grab on to her again now it's very unusual to see a Moro reflex retained beyond the first four to six months something that isn't retained moreover is an abnormal startle response is a condition that made my top ten best name disease list back in February the jumping Frenchman of Maine syndrome it's a rare pathological startle response in adults which gets its name from a group of Lumberjacks who exhibited the reflex described in 1878 like the Moro rooting and sucking our reflexes that appear in the womb very premature babies might not have developed them which is why they can't always feed properly but for a term baby they are pre-programmed to seek out and devour Mama's milk from their first minute of course suckling is very much what defines mammals our name comes from the Latin for breast mama rooting turning the head towards stimulus and the suck reflex should both go by about three to four months the baby can still suck of course but he can choose when he wants to do it so if he wants to cry and I give him a dummy he looked me in the eye and say do you really think this is going to work at my age whereas with a younger baby its involuntary that tender moment when your newborn baby holds your finger when you feel a special connection to them like they've just reached out and touched your heart because they held onto you so tight they must know that you're their parent yeah that's just an involuntary reflex indeed we think the grasp response as this is called is a remnant of when we were covered in fur newborn baby primates who share almost all of these reflexes cling on to their mothers in this way you can tell the grasp reflex has gone as patient B can now handle toys opening and closing his hands at will the asymmetric tonic neck reflex gives babies that cute sleeping position that we've all seen when the head is turned to the left the left hand goes and vice-versa it's thought this might play a part in getting through the birth canal alter bring each hand into the baby's vision so that they can discover their hands the asymmetric tonic neck reflex disappears by six months as you can see so what can this useless old patient actually show us he's been pretty much no help at all so far well at eight and a half months he might still have a couple of reflexes that he had before he might have a gallant response he demonstrated it nicely at three weeks old he's a lot heavier now and coincidentally I'm about as strong as a baby so he's a bit harder to hold in one hand but let's give it a try the gallant response is where you stroke down one side of the spine and the spine flexes to the same side it's thought to assist with crawling and again it's possibly related to getting through the birth canal the planter or Babinski reflex is one we examined for in every age group if you're a healthy adult and I scratched the bottom of your foot your toes will curl downwards but in the first year of life before babies learn to walk or in an adult who has suffered something like a stroke the toes go up and indeed you can see patient B still has an upgoing plant which is entirely normal patient B's elder brother' patient a or control demonstrates how by three years old the plantar response is down going other reflexes not shown symmetric tonic neck reflex the parachute reflex stepping dive crawling babkin and Perez reflexes I mean mom's going out let's watch Sun patrol
