[Music] this video is sponsored by Vikings war join my Vikings clan under my nickname scare theater on June 3rd 2018 a user on reddit by the name of just made this account made it post in the confession subreddit in the post he details that he is a 19 year old kid that was raised in a cult he explains the situation that led him to feel very lonely and empty furthermore he says that his job is to sell things online for his family and if he's caught browsing reddit or whatever else then he'll be beaten his mother checks a search history nightly but apparently they aren't too tech-savvy so they don't know that he can just use incognito mode this post blew up very quickly gaining over 19,000 upvotes and over a thousand comments along with all those attention came a lot of people who were worried about him some people even went as far as to offer to buy him a plane ticket he turned down all the offers for help claiming that he doesn't want to leave the cult he just wants to place the vent about his frustrations he believes that the cult is protecting him from the outside world and that if he leaves he won't have anywhere to go this user has continued to post a moie on reddit since then and his post have only gotten weirder today we're going to take a look at what has been figured out about this person so far and whether or not this whole thing is even real [Music] just made this account's posts reveal a lot about the emotions that he feels he's made post about wanting to see the ocean asking how to figure out his ethnicity and how he can get more energy some of his posts however are a little darker he has multiple posts talking about how he is constantly miserable and struggling with depression he's even made a lot of post hinting at suicide these feelings are no doubt coming from being treated unfairly by the cult there are several references to this he made a couple of post displaying his artwork but also says that his family throws away his drawings because art is rebelling against God he even got kicked out for almost two weeks the darkest post he made would be the ones that he posted in the rape subreddit and one of his posts he makes it pretty clear as someone in the cult is raping him and the only reason that goes along with it is that he can save his sister's from having the same fate in another post he even asked how you can get custody over his siblings probably in an attempt to keep them safe on August 30th just made this account's post started getting even stranger he made a post which simply said look in the garden and the following two posts were bible quotes the five post after this were all asking where to buy his supplant oil then the rest of these posts from that point until today with the exception of one or more Bible quotes people in the comments went crazy trying to figure out what was happening as he wasn't even responding to any one at this point many people theorized that the cult figured out about the things he was posting on reddit and took over posting all this weird stuff when someone finally did establish contact with him he said that he was okay and he was posting all his biblical passages for repentance what was he repenting for we don't really know as proof that he really was the one posting someone asked him to submit more of his artwork and he posted this [Music] right now there's a discord group full of people who are currently investigating this trying to see what they can do for this person a couple of people there have established contact with him through private messaging but does he doesn't seem to trust anyone he won't say much from his posts and the things that he has said there are a few things that we know about him he's 19 years old but apparently just turned 20 he thinks that he's Asian he's weak and gets sick easily and the cult gave him the name Isaiah we can only deduce a few things about the cult from the things Isaiah has told us first of all we know if the cult sells things online like nuts berries peas women's skincare worship material candles and drive stacks Isaiah won't tell us the names of any of these stores since he doesn't want us finding out anything about where he is but if we were to find in one of the websites where the cult is selling this stuff we could easily find out where he is we know the cult has goats electricity leases gas for cooking Isaiah has previously mentioned they lived in Western Canada most likely British Columbia the cult is located far away from major cities and it's possibly a polygamist cult seeing as Isaiah once mentioned his mother's plural there has been a lot of speculation on which cult is in but I've come to the conclusion that Isaiah is part of the 12 tribes cult because Isaiah I said many things that are consistent with 12 tribes first of all 12 tribes is several locations in British Columbia additionally they had a pretty large online presence and they are known to run a candle-making business and sell hyssop oil this cult please that art is against God just like Isaiah's coal believes the most solidifying factor in this theory however is that they refer to Jesus as yahushua Yahshua is one of the transliterations of jesus but this transliteration is extremely commonly used by twelve tribes literally if you type in Yahshua colt on Google twelve tribes will be the first search result all this information together almost completely confirms that Isaiah is a part of 12 this still doesn't tell us exactly where Isaiah is since 12 tribes has seven locations in British Columbia but regardless this is progress as intriguing as this whole situation is we do need to take into consideration the possibility of this is all just a hoax it wouldn't be the first time someone lied about something like this and so far we've really just been taking Isaiah's were destroyed it's great that everyone is trying to help him since if it's Israel something has to be done but we also don't want to waste our time on a troll there are a few inconsistencies in Isaiah story one of them became apparent to me whether this court group made an attempt to grab his IP address we sent him an IP grabber link which he clicked on twice and we got two different IP addresses they both led to Montreal Canada which is on the complete opposite side of where I as a acclaims to be now his IP address led back to a company that offers VPN services so it's likely he's using a VPN to hide his IP address this becomes even more likely when he'd take a look at a comment on one of his posts or someone recommends that he install a VPN what's interesting about this is that the VPN Isaiah is using a cost a monthly fee and Isaiah's Cult the money that he makes selling things online go straight to the cult he doesn't keep any of it so how is he paying for the VPN surely he didn't get a cult member to pay for it this question still hasn't been adequately answered someone in the discord group linked the comment which is now deleted or someone allegedly said they would give Isaiah money for the VPN this still isn't confirmed though since there's no way to see what the comment actually said nor confirma this guy actually paid for the VPN or not second Isaiah told one of the people in the disk group that a kid saw him browsing Reddit and snitched on him to one of the cult members this is why I started posting a bunch of Bible quotes to repent for what he did so my question is that if he's repenting for being on Reddit then why is he still posting on there he even posted more of his artwork despite being told that was a sin as well it doesn't make sense that he would repent by doing the same thing he's repenting for in the first place third they're just a lot of things he's saying that seem to contradict each other every time someone offers him help he says that he doesn't want to escape get in another post he says I just feel really like I need to escape all of this one of the contradictions that really surprised me or when he made a post to asking what to do with he's going to be homeless soon and in the comments he seemed totally okay with the idea it's hiking with random strangers yet the people that have offered to come to where he hasn't pick him up he declines he also talks a lot about wanting to be here for a sibling so they can be safe he goes as far as to ask how he can get custody over them yet he also talked about suicide and refuses any way out of the situation why would you want custody over someone if you think you're going to be dead soon anyway forth someone in the discord group said that Isaiah told him we didn't have an email address so they tried to make one for him but he never used it here's where the inconsistency comes in if you look on his reddit profile his account is email verified so either he was lying about having an email or he's using the cults email address even if that word case is still one it makes sense and that would mean the court would be notified every time I made a post or received the comment or message finally he seems to be extremely cautious about giving us any information that would reveal his location since he doesn't want to be saved well for someone so set on not giving away any personal information he's given us quite a lot if we were able to deduce this much and this little amount of time there's so much here that just isn't adding up and normally inconsistency is a consequence of lying as much as there is it doesn't make much sense I'll admit there are also some things that really make me wonder if this is genuine to start this has been going on for months now it would take a lot of dedication to keep something going for this long also he's made quite a few posts in the rape subreddit or should be a pretty insensitive thing to do if you were faking all this and finally I want to go back to what I said about the VPN if he were faking this well then it would be pretty impressive that he was willing to spend money on a VPN just to troll people of course as possible he could have already had a VPN beforehand but we don't know that the last thing I did to try and get some further insight into this was create a timeline showing the exact dates and times isaiah's posts were published in his time zone since he mentioned that his mother checks his search history nightly and that he only post and others are out doing work or asleep I wanted to see if as posting times were consistent with that this is what I found most of his posts were made in the afternoon which would make sense if his family was working at that time a couple of his posts are in the morning and most of the other ones were posted late at night none of them were posted early in the night so this is all pretty consistent the only thing that stands out are the post on October 16th which were all posted in the evening but that could have been for any number of reasons still this alone doesn't necessarily prove or disprove anything now if this is a hoax then we'll leave the question of why he's not making any money off of this so why would someone put this much effort into a hoax he could be trying to make an Arg or maybe he's doing it for the reddit Karma or maybe he's just a really dedicated troll but despite all of my doubts and still possible this guy could be telling the truth if this Israel then I hope that Isaiah can get some help but I'm still pretty skeptical on the whole thing regardless of what I think the next step for the discord group seems to be trying to contact former 12 tribes members and seeing if they remember anything about an Asian kid named Isaiah so if anything noteworthy happens I'll keep you guys updated thank you for watching and I'll see you on the flip side you you [Music] Oh
