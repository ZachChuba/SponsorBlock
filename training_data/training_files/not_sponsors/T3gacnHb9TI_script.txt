Winter is unquestionably the best season - for
skiing. And for full moons. We're lucky enough to have winters because
the earth's plane of rotation is tilted relative to its orbit. This means that when part of the earth is
tilted towards the sun, the sun stays in the sky for a longer amount of time each day,
and it's warm out. Summer! Of course, when that part of the earth is
tilted away from the sun, the sun is lower in the sky and doesn't stay up as long. This might make winter darker, but you can
think of it as bonus time pointing towards interstellar space! And, as I said before, winter has the best
full moons. The moon is new when it's on the same side
of the earth as the sun, and it doesn't reflect any light on us. This also means the new moon generally mirrors
the sun on its journey across the sky - it more or less rises and sets with the sun and
follows a similar path. On the other hand, the moon is full when it's
on the opposite side of the earth from the sun, its whole face reflecting the sun's light
back at us. Because of this opposite position, a full
moon is only ever up at night, rising at sunset and setting at sunrise, and it consequently
also behaves the way the sun does in the opposite season. When a part of the earth is tilted towards
the full moon, it's tilted away from the sun - and vice versa. So a summer full moon is like a winter sun
- only appearing for a few hours and staying close to the horizon. But a winter full moon is like a summer sun
- it's up for a long time and takes a high path through the sky. In the darkest months, the moon, at least
when it's full, gives us long, beautifully lit nights. Combined with a quiet blanket of snow and
the shimmering aurora, how can you not love winter?
