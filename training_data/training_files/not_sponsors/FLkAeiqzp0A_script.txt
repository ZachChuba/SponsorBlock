oops though okay okay oh did they remove the nose there's no way they removed that rule there's no i would not risk it but he told me that i doubt it either way i just i just have to get my super professional shirt on here thank you thank you luke there we go oh yeah rtx on you don't want to stand up and like show everyone how that twitter twitter hates this shirt oh yeah they're like why would i buy that and uh i i heard through the grapevine that some people at nvidia have seen it already yeah and they're like so was he saying that like rtx makes him hard or that like rtx can suck it and i'm just like neither of those not even the meme it's when you've got a big rate of trace you need ray tracing right yeah i mean it's a lie but i'm gonna wear the shirt oh boy oh this week that's been a good week as long as you're not nvidia hoping to keep rtx 20 actually no never mind that's well ah what can i say i was part way through i was like why is he stuttering on this and then i realized that maybe there's so there is a good chance okay that reviews of the rtx graphics cards when they come because we know everyone has them right because unboxings went up today yeah so so i could extrapolate from that that probably reviews are coming at some point do we have one yes okay yeah um we did an unboxing today of a network switch and my new router with rtx boxes in the background nice okay pure lulls pure lulls that's great so people like the comments are full of like i thought it would be the iphone 10s i thought it would be rtx graphics nope neither um it's what i wanted to do um so so so okay so we know everyone has cards um and we we know that uh usually reviews come you know i don't know a week or so after unboxings start to go up generally a couple weeks a week or two um especially when they embargo everything what we don't know is what if anything with rtx in it could possibly be included in a review in that time frame no no these are all things that okay so there's okay but we'll get into it more later but i'm just i'm just saying gear up for disappointment i mean there's one good game in that list it's not about good games or bad games it's about having the rest having it do you have this which one hellblade center was sacrificed um okay but is the feature enabled because we also have shadow of the tomb raider which doesn't have the patch yeah and pubg okay i love how pub g is under the rest oh okay newly added in there oh okay all right all right anyway anyway topics for this week nvidia has revealed some performance of the rtx series but like one question one question have you tried rtx no i haven't you know what save that for after the intro because i don't want people you know leaving the video yet okay because that's like as soon as people see it because that's the title of the videos it's something about rtx performance as soon as people get that they're just gonna leave they're gonna leave us and we're gonna be sad that does that would make me sad um actually i just i just you know what screw it we'll talk about it now but you have to watch the intro first [Music] no it's all rtrt [Music] [Music] i'm in trouble now oh boy colton's going to yell at me you know he has gotten pretty big for his britches he like gets mad at me when i do stuff wrong now do you remember do you remember how timid he was yes very much so like i would if you told me back then that he would eventually do that part of me would be like it's colton i could see it but at the same time no no he was like oh apparently the intro volume is bunged up for some reason i have no idea why that is but i blame jake um yeah me too uh anyway the uh what was i talking about yeah colton when he first started i'd be like hey colton would you mind maybe please doing something to be like okay i'm sorry whereas now he's like yeah you're done you done screwed that up but don't worry i'll fix it you know he's like he's all like businessy it's crazy laser focused anyway i forget why i was talking about colton right yeah cause he's gonna he's gonna give me crap if i if i say the sponsor's name wrong anyway um why don't we jump right into tell me so you were you were at i guess uh was it what oh my goodness it's september you were at pax then how does it pass yeah so you tried rtx yeah okay there was an all right there's an in so how much of your life okay would you want to look back on and not have had rtx in it um yeah i don't i don't i understand this is the meme but i don't i don't remember exactly how uh steve replied to the meme so i can't do like the proper meme response yeah um but yeah i know it was i mean it was cool uh i had some some bigger and other takeaways though i asked i was very specific about what i was able to talk about from the invite-only event uh okay am i right not allowed to say what game it was and i can't say whether or not it's on the list of games that we have here but i can talk about the experience i just can't talk about what game it was i think the reason for that was but yeah i can talk about how good it was they're being so cagey about this they are being very cagey but i was able yeah i was able to use frame rate limiters on demos i have an interesting idea as to why that might be okay all right all right we'll get into that next then looks like this is going to be the rtx show so are are we going into another topic or am i no no okay so they had a cool feature where you could just tap i think it was f1 yeah and it would rapidly switch between rtx on and rtx off sure like there was like no lag no switching between it at all um and there was no frame rate difference and i think that was the reason why they limited was because they didn't want to show you the difference even if there was a very minor difference in performance if there was some amount it would skew the conversation away from what rtx looked like and they wanted the conversation to be about what it looked like sure now the second part was how good did it look yes i can't tell you what game it was which would be super helpful for explaining how good it looked but i'll give you the vague definitely not enough information it looked very good which is useless because you don't know what game that's not you know what and i can't tell you you know what i want riley back on the lan show instead i want riley back he's going to review the rtx 2080 um i will say do you know about this yes no i do know about this yeah i saw that well that was nuts people freaked out way too hardcore i watched it and was like i don't understand what people are upset about riley watched it and was like i don't understand so the thing is that people were like linus you made a joke and it didn't land but i think what they're missing is that riley was the one who made the joke and it was an inside joke to me yeah and i made an inside joke back to him and it was fine and we don't it didn't really matter if it landed with you guys not everything on the wan show is necessarily about okay like it is it's obviously it's a show it's right in there it's show but but some of to keep some banter going some inside stuff is going to be said because you're just in the flow of things okay here's the big winner though rtx off looked horrible and i can't tell you so are we back to the whole stupid hdr on and off again thing again like no that this is where okay so my theory is like the games looked intentionally destroyed with hdr off this is where i think it's different this is all theory crafting i couldn't get any answers out of them obviously but in the pitch that happened before yeah we saw the game a big part they brought up was that enabling rtx putting rtx into your game is super easy this is really important it takes very little time it takes very little work okay so basically where it's going whatever game this is has just garbage town lighting because that's hard and it has good lighting with rtx because rtx is easy is that what we're saying so it looks like um but part of the problem is it's killing me here i can't say what game it was yeah but either people that have war maybe maybe i will say that something along the lines of that game that has existed in the past whether it was a previous version or it was the same development house or it was something i don't i'm not i can't get too specific the lighting was really good okay like notably really good okay and it looked like trash so so i think the thing that's happening is yeah i don't know this is all super unconfirmed i think the thing that's happening is it's really easy to turn rtx on you can save development dollars by just throwing rtx on your game then it'll look really good you can get great screenshots and get great demos some people will have a great experience in the game so just turn rtx on and then for all of the plebs who maybe you know you just don't care about or whatever they can just have a garbage experience yeah and i'm hoping that whatever game it was and i think this is why i'm not allowed to say it is because they're probably gonna work on their rtx off okay but i think nvidia wanted to show it before they had worked on their rtx off of course so i think the rtx off will get better because they'll work on it but it revealed this potential scenario where they just plug rtx into their game and they're like well that's enough you know what it seems like to me this whole thing is just not ready yeah and it's being rushed yeah i really really like the idea of the tech like the hardware not yeah ray tracing necessarily but having the ai cores being able to move things onto the air cores because with having async on your cuda cores and having like physical async with being able to move things to the other cores like being able to pull anti-aliasing and putting it on one of the ai cores and stuff that's super cool i really really like that stuff um i don't know so part of my idea is i think they're trying to add something a little bit less tangible to the difference between nvidia cards and amd cards you mean more more tangible or something less quantitatively yeah yeah yeah so like an fps number and a dollar number are very we we used to i'm sure we still do make dollar per performance graphs for everything all the time because it's a really good measure but that's they've been trying to do that for years with gf experience which by the way i don't think was unintentional geforce experience gf experience yeah i know right okay i mean they also called a tv uh yeah bfg display the fgd yeah yeah i mean these guys man um anyway anyway anyway the point is they've been trying to differentiate themselves through features and experiences for years now i don't blame them which which i don't blame them for at all but um and for a long time to be honest i think they kind of had it and then i think they pissed a lot of people off with the geforce experience stuff yeah um they've they've helped it a lot i'm gonna keep giving them credit for this because now there's it's way more easier to not install it i appreciate that um that is that is way way way better i don't know afk gym 420 says i see the new architecture will make the rtx cards viable for longer as they age being able to offload some of the work to other course okay the issue with that is that unless nvidia absolutely nailed it like this is the first attempt and i don't think i've ever seen that happen before where whether it's uh beefing up the gpu for like whenever it's then the next the next gen gpu tech whether it's a tessellation or whether it's a new shader model or whatever the case may be whenever there's some new piece of tech that lands the first implementation in hardware always kind of misses something and it's the tweaked one that goes oh yeah we just needed a little bit more reinforcement over there and oh okay now we're we're not we're not starving the rest of the pipeline it's much better i just i have i just am so i'm so hesitant to just say you know yeah go ahead that way you're gonna have the tech that you need going forward it's future proof well that's never a good idea exactly it's like so when i was shopping for my car one of the reasons i ended up with the volt is that it is the yes so the 2017 volt is the second model year of the third generation design of this car now you compare that one of the other cars i was looking at was the honda clarity that is the first model year it is an all-new actually it's an all it was the all-new model year of a completely new car that's what mine is which is terrifying because from one car manufacturer to another i don't think there are any exceptions here that i'm aware of the all-new platform tends to have some bugs that need to be wrinkled out and that do get fixed over the next two to three years so yeah i bought my cars used for suresies and they were like done with that model by the time i bought the car and i knew any potential problems that it might have to be clear so that helps a lot yeah but in my case i was going in completely cold on the clarity yeah they only had a handful of them for canada apparently so i just yeah wall street like it could be a super awesome i i think it probably will be a great card i i think a lot of the the media right now i think a lot of the fans are confused by some of the media reaction because the media is really frustrated that we don't have performance stuff there's been really weird embargo setups and that tom's article just set everyone on fire um but like themselves on fire is what they did it sounds really cool yeah i'm not scared of this card like i don't think it's gonna if if the rtx stuff doesn't work that great you can just turn it off so you can hate a lot of things about nvidia you can hate their marketing you can hate their prices you can hate their uh you can hate the way that they engage with the market and with their partners with the geforce partner program yeah but you're you're probably missing something like there's pro problem likely exists between the keyboard and chair unless you're a member of the linux community because they really haven't treated that community very well over the years but there's probably something else wrong if you look at the product itself and you go you know it's bad yeah they're good it's not bad yeah you can have a lot of problems with nvidia with nvidia products but as a general rule they aren't bad they might not be the best value per dollar for the the particular workload that you're looking at but there are a lot of things that in fairness to nvidia we have to give them credit for they support legacy products for an unfreaking believable amount of time like how far does it go back now i'm actually i'm quite i'm quite curious if you go on their site how far back does the latest geforce driver go so let's throw 10 series in here so they've still got downloads on their site going all the way back to geforce what uh oh crap it keeps uh screening scrolling g46 series and their most recent driver so they've it only goes up to windows 7 but bear in mind you can typically install a windows 7 driver on windows 10. they supported that card up to 2015. okay so the 6800 gt uh ultra oh wow did they launch with the i think they launched with the gt so the 6800 gt was launched in some okay two no there's some oh here we go was launched in 2004 they supported that card for 11 years yeah i'll let well it's february 2015 it was late 2004. so 10 years when you compare that to what the typical smartphone manufacturer will do like apple apple's a shining beacon in the smartphone industry in terms of model support i was looking at a table of how long apple has supported their devices and it's anywhere from three years and and lots of change like almost four to four and a half years and in some cases even a little over four and a half years when even google is only committing what two years i think for pixel devices i think oneplus is committing two os updates so about two years we got to give them credit for what they do do well it's not a bad product someone in chat is saying they just bully partners to buy old cards but they're not bad sure i don't know i have no idea what you're talking about i don't know what it means and that's literally the point we're talking about is that the product is good yep so you might not like other things there can be all kinds and you cannot buy nvidia out of principle and i'm sure you could find a dozen reasons to do it that's not the point the point is that we don't have a reason to believe that the upcoming rtx cards will be bad yeah we just also don't have a reason to believe that rtx will be the game-changing feature that they say it will or that the rtx cards will fully enable the the will give you the full experience of that as new games come out over the coming years and hopefully hopefully hopefully it does hopefully it does hopefully we're totally wrong but we have no idea super cool but until nvidia is willing to it's not even that we're wrong we just don't have any information yeah until they're willing to put up or shut up like what are we supposed to say if we can't test rtx then we can't form an opinion yeah so right now all we can do is speculate based on the past and in the past i've observed this pattern so that's all i can really tell you guys yeah um all right let's have a look oh yeah so right they're finally talking about performance and these slides aren't like exceedingly helpful but um that's pretty usual yeah so as as per usual they're just kind of vague but there you go we've got something to work with here the original sources from overclock3d.net but oh that's deep learning imaging so they're saying both rtx 2080 and 2080 ti are going to be capable of 4k 60fps gaming what the crap does this line mean i am not sure is this 0 is this 30 i'm not sure um this is actually like pretty much the worst not the worst but it's like it's close to there yeah it's pretty dumb um and cause like what what actually goes down this is it the frame rate or is it the resolution um is it both but like by weird amounts i don't know like this is basically what is causing all this speculation around rtx and that like maybe it sucks because nvidia is just and this looks like kind of a dumb response to all of it because nvidia is just being so tight-lipped about the whole thing and just going no no no ray tracing ray tracing ray tracing when really a lot of gamers especially the ones that are playing games that won't have ray tracing like um i don't know that's another thing i got from the demo you will not want it on for multiplayer well yeah like ever at all ever i don't think ever really why because there's more shadows oh i see and like darker shadows because if you definitely know where the light source is coming from instead of just like washing a room with light it's gonna there's gonna be like oh there's like a branch that crosses the light source here so there's a huge shadow cast across that whole area okay wait i am going to pitch you something here okay what about rainbow six rainbow six specifically like siege are you talking siege i'm talking about i'm talking about rainbow six style games okay so so yeah siege is the one everyone's playing right now right yeah yeah where basically interacting with the environment is a huge part of the gameplay so if you could hit a light causing a shadow of an opponent to appear somewhere the more realistic that interaction potentially the better just hit a light like if you shoot out a bulb or something turn a light off though yes or what what if you could add one would you throw a flare i'm just i'm just throwing that out there what if they made it a fundamental because this is the whole conversation that i'm sure we've had multiple times but i've had definitely with a lot of people over the years going all the way back to when phys x was first introduced and what was that stupid game [Music] shoot i forget it was like a like a space marine style like running around game but physx was a fundamental part of the gameplay demo game i'm talking about borderlands no no no no no no it was um oh no help me run faster in if you had an intel ssd no it was basically a demo like this is before the nvidia cell factor revolution yeah a cell factor yes thank you good call ricky dog thank you self actor rick yog sorry no not cell factory yeah like it disappeared it never got finished um but there was like like you could like do physics things and like move stuff around and like it was um wait was it cell factor no hold on definitely no it wasn't roblox i think i think it was sell factor as far as i know it like never got finished yeah i'm pretty sure it was sell faster anyway anyway anyway the point is it was this cool demo where physx was a fundamental core part of gameplay but it never took off because you couldn't count on everyone to have physx because i mean especially because at the time it was it was like a hardware card you had to buy it was a separate accelerator card um this whole thing feels very phys x but built into the card yeah but the thing is is that we've had phys x built into the card and still all you can do is kick garbage around on the ground as batman and see your cape flutter better because of physx like it's still not a core part of gameplay so to me i think you could if if the rainbow six developers were like yeah we're going to take the destructibility of the environment and the lighting of the environment to a whole new level but you have to have rtx i think no game that's actually going to be competitive would ever do that uneven playing field for hardware is not something that has ever gone well for competitiveness no and requiring people to have super high-end hardware is just not a thing i guess that's where i'm going with this is that you you won't be able to make it fundamental to game play unless you can count on everyone if you can set up if you if you can like shoot a door off a car and then use the reflections off the door to like see someone coming around the corner yeah like that sounds freaking sweet yep sounds pretty single player to me dude yeah like i don't i don't think that's going to be a thing and it sounds single player but like not which is the gameplay single player games are great there was a very recently there was a thread trending on i don't remember what that was talking about how like people that just don't play multiplayer games anymore and all this kind of stuff and there's actually a lot of really great single-player games that have been coming out for a while there's quite a few great single-player games on the horizon and you might even find like pve multiplayer games we don't care as much okay and you might just want the lighting because you want to look really cool and that might all that's all great that's all awesome i'm not saying there isn't benefits to it i just think like people who want to be hardcore competitive i don't think it's going to be a thing it probably won't even be an option and i'm just saying until you can make it fundamental to gameplay it's always uh it's always uh a bell and whistle and there's some people that will care yeah definitely some people but just like gameplay is king like you know it's the whole nintendo thing yeah where did i completely agree with this the switch doesn't look any better than what like a ps3 if that is it even does it even look as good as a ps3 it's a hard thing to compare when the stupid ps3 come out if you define look as good that would be like what resolution and frame rate it can push but nintendo titles on general have like a way different art style which they do they do doesn't need more hardware but that's exactly the point is like gameplay is far more important oh yeah than lighting i've had more fun on my switch physics for like a long time than my computer rip honestly 95 of my gaming time in the last few months has been zelda breath of the wild oh yeah it's great it's a great game i'm not sure yet but like i don't care because i just go and like walk around the mountains and like find snails yeah and like dudes super mario tennis aces actually super fun yeah i was like when i got it i was like it's like a full price tennis title have you played overcooked no but it looks really i tried it for the first time uh last week it's really good yeah so we're gonna when we do the lands do you know about the land center yeah i was there when we made the decision to stick okay yeah so when we build the land center i want to put like a big screen like a projector yeah and that'll be so we'll have consoles and pc with controllers but i want that to be like the the the local multiplayer yeah set up spot and we are going to play some overcooked hell yeah fair i'm actually so excited for that land center me too i uh i haven't watched it yet but it was cool that you had nothing up here yeah do you even did you know not much i had to like stream a pda him before but like i didn't feel bad because he like he was like yeah i'm pretty sure i've watched your videos before it was like an intel thing to kind of put us together yeah honestly i had a lot of fun just doing the stream with him so that was great no he's cool yeah yeah i couldn't believe it when he chicken dinnered the one pubg match that he got to play as part of his sponsor so like still though even if you're really good you got like eight kills yeah so so so okay so what happened was intel sponsored him to come up here as part of gamer days to build a pc with me so my commitment was to build a pc for him and then he was supposed to stream for like a few hours after we built the pc um just like from our office here on that pc or or the exact same spec but like it was actually whatever yeah yeah anyway the point is um his flight got delayed so we had to throw the machine together we did like a super quick build like i was cutting oh like he got here late yeah okay okay yeah and then he only got to stream for like one round and then the fact that he won it i was when he was on his way out i was like yeah [Laughter] way to go man that is pretty cool that's awesome that's freaking awesome you won your first game didn't you i i did yeah but i didn't kill anyone you still won i had you carrying me and uh joe and joe and then who else did we have well we had dennis we got dennis later i think was it dennis i think that was dangerous yeah it was dennis but dennis died he died we had basically a three-man squad now to be clear just because i didn't kill anyone doesn't mean i didn't help he did help he actually did a fair amount of damage too because you're pinging people with a sniper i'm i'm i'm a good i'm a good helper and i can communicate you're spotting making calls and hitting people at least once with a sniper which is like actually a huge help because you only need to hit them once or twice the same just the same not that bad uh g ltt which actually gets us perfectly into our next segment here which i'm not even sure if it's a topic this week yeah i don't think it's his dedication to keeping the office clean i know he's like you guys can't see it but he's prone on the ground yeah it's actually kind of embarrassing i'm embarrassed for him i'm proud of him did you read the super chats yet no um so this is great chrome hold on hold on someone in chat where do i get my rtx on shirt oh um designed by humans ltt i'll post it in the chat oh wait ltt i guess i should probably put linus down no here it is yeah it's the first if you just google design by human's linus tech tips you'll find it yeah it's fine i got i got it i'll throw it in the chat i'll throw in the chat cool oh right two chats oh lordy well there it is in twitch chat uh-oh i'm a bad youtuber officially officially 10 out of 10 bad youtuber because i completely forgot that we were even streaming on youtube i streamed earlier on youtube so i you know i got that going for me i can't even find it i don't even see the stream here in the thing someone in the super chat says i wonder if ltt youtube channel going to do the community join thing like with the join button on channel uh that is a great question and one that i would love to answer for you give me a moment i'm just going to post that thing there uh yes there um so we are but floatplane is not going away so this is something that luke and i i think talked about on the wan show a little while ago when we were both kind of independently having huge freak outs and then together having a huge freak out and then realized that it's not actually a big deal yeah because the whole i forget what it's called supporter uh contributor sponsor i forget what it's called when someone i think it's called sponsor clicks that button uh but basically it's like a twitch it's like a twitch sub the button is titled join is it okay join it's a join button but i don't remember what you become so when someone does that they pay money and it helps support the creator and also gives some money to google and um other than that yeah i think you get some like emojis but there's there's not a ton of tangible benefits so there's no early access so in it already right out of the gate it doesn't compete with float planes well what we consider to be at least one of floatplane's sort of dominant features is early access to video so there you go um there's not actually as much overlap as you might think and two the way that we see it both for supporters and for creators there is always going to be the people who wouldn't go off platform like just have no interest in leaving youtube.com and would do want to support linus media group but they want to do it on youtube.com there's always going to be those people and then there's always going to be the people that don't want to give google a dollar they'll turn on adblock they will refuse any kind of contribution that gives google a cut and for those people there's always going to have to be a third party option and we see ourselves especially in the direction that we're going right now as being able to be a very strong third-party option so life is not as simple as this one or this one why not both maybe they could just co-exist i mean we always said we're not a youtube competitor and that's true so we're just gonna have to keep not being a youtube competitor and i guess i'm speaking as floatplane media linus right now as opposed to youtuber l minus media group linus but then from linus media group's perspective we have always been all about diversification yeah that's why we joined vessel that's why we started linustechtips.com forum that's why we reached out to partners directly to bake sponsorships into our videos rather than being entirely dependent on adsense because we don't want to be completely reliant on google because google is actually they're on a bit of a run right now towards us because i know other creators have had some issues with them yeah but for us they're on a bit of a run right now where they've been actually supporting us really well but the thing is that you can't necessarily count on that lasting forever because we've had situations where there was no communication from google and all of a sudden there's these guidelines for how they're not going to allow you to have sponsors built into your content anymore unless you adhere to all these like weird rules like you can't show any logos in your video yeah like that was awkward trying to explain to someone like squarespace yeah we can talk about your service and we can have our site be built with squarespace and we can say you know we love squarespace and it's really cool but we can't show your logo on screen they'd be like what we'd like well so the issue is that if we do that then you have to buy through google all of the advertising on that video but then i don't know how that works because you can't buy it perpetually they don't even have a system for that yeah but what could you possibly have been thinking so stuff like that has happened in the past so that's why um someone wants to know if we can add a manual monthly fee and flow plane i mean i okay so actually from the outside it has appeared as the float plane hasn't changed much in the last four to six weeks but luke and i actually had a really good meeting yesterday and um there's going to be some big updates coming hopefully next week right yeah yeah so theoretically we're pushing the the most important but probably the hardest to tell one on monday and then there's uh there's more stuff coming right after that yeah so so expect to see new features actually happening over the next little bit um let's see should we do another topic or should i talk about a lot of the questions oh right right right because i was saying speaking of www chrome is like killing www yeah i don't think it's one of our actual topics in here this week but um and so you'll have to forgive me for not having a ton of background on it but i thought that was interesting because technically there's no reason why linustechtips.com and www.linustechtips.com had to be the same thing in the past it just happened that out of convenience and out of sort of convention and habit generally speaking webmasters tried to make them the same thing because consumers are lazy and they don't want to type www.every time but google is actually formalizing this whole thing which from the perspective of some security sort of minded individuals could be a problem because all of a sudden it could be a way for you to uh to hijack someone who otherwise would have intended to go to a different site so maybe you can explain in more detail how the crap that would work well i right now i'm i'm not entirely sure and usually i'd have some angle for this but i've actually read a few threads on it and there's a lot of people debating each other on how exactly it's going to work so i don't i don't want to speak to it too much if you are interested in it there there's a lot of people talking about it and you can definitely find threads out there on your own um but yeah it it it gets pretty weird because there's there's one camp where they're talking about like well um i don't remember how that was supposed to work but like subdomaining paypal onto things yeah can maybe make it look like you're somewhere else and like yeah it's there's some weird stuff that you might be able to do with it basically it's right now it's an unknown yeah and that's really scary from a web security perspective especially because this change feels very unnecessary i think i think honestly i think the vast majority of it or all of it is known i think the implications of it are a little confusing yes and hard to understand and a lot of people are talking about it when not a lot of people understand what's actually happening um this is a great super chat bklb yo i'm late to the show what are the specs core clock memory clock give me give me give me um it it'll be archived also uh youtube live streaming has a great feature where you can actually rewind it we talked about rtx for the first half of the show uh thanks man um calvin says thanks for the beanbag chair is that actually the guy that we just like gave a bing bean bag chair to for no reason i have no one i can't remember why we did it i just remember being like oh yeah sure whatever let's just do it and i think we were trying to get rid of it or something maybe um maybe he like paid for it but like it was just a little bit i don't remember exactly what happened um oh a lot of people were wondering what was up with that weird live stream last night so that was a new youtube feature called premieres and what happens with premieres is that it seems like it hits you guys with a notification early and then you're supposed to come back and watch the video at exactly the moment it goes live and there's a live chat but the video is actually pre-produced so there were a lot of people that seemed to be upset because they were like this isn't live pre-recorded pre-recorded hashtag pre-recorded and yes it was supposed to be pre-recorded yeah so this is actually a feature that and luke and i still have some ideas that are different and could be better but this was actually a feature that we had discussed doing on floorplan like two years ago like two years ago but dev takes time anyway the point is the idea behind it is that it is a normal video but we schedule when it goes live now we often schedule our videos but in this case we're scheduling it in a way that you guys can see so you'll know exactly when to come back with your popcorn and hang out in the chat and like talk interact live with each other and or me it was actually me and nick that were both manning the linus tech tips account last night and give commentary on the video as you're watching it as you're all watching it together and then as soon as that premiere is done then it just a switch flips and it becomes just a normal youtube video neat huh yeah uh andrew asks if i will talk about conservatives being banned from youtube and twitter if you're talking specifically about alex jones um no i won't i will not be talking about that thank you great question that's a way to get banned on youtube [Laughter] oh here's a question for you yeah if alex jones okay came to you sure and said i want to be on floatplane sure what do you say sure good me too so people we might want to clarify why should we clarify why well because we don't want to be we don't want to really we just don't we're not even an open platform you would have to pay to go see his content so if you are going to be offended by his content or driven off by his content don't actively give him money don't give him money and you won't see it and you're fine and the other thing too is like we do draw the line at anything illegal so i know that some people have speculated that he's been banned because of some pending lawsuits or whatever else but that doesn't necessarily mean that the content that he uploaded was illegal i actually don't know that it wasn't right frankly i haven't looked at that i doubt either of us know almost anything but until he did something illegal on floatplane.com then there wouldn't really be a conversation to be had about it i don't i don't know almost anything about him i know some people don't like him and i don't know um people are asking so would you allow denying sandy hook on floatplane i don't agree with it but as far as i can tell it's not illegal so if you give them money yeah don't give them money would be like the best suggestion um all right is that what he did is that everyone's angry but i really know nothing about honestly he's been doing that for years that's just a particularly stupid thing that he's done yes that's weird yeah it's a it's a very bizarre now someone chat said he did not do that see i don't know i can't keep on top of this stuff but i just don't care um oh do we have to cover the iphone 10s 10s max and 10r have you even have you kept up with this have you seen this have you heard about this dude i've been busy um yeah they seem like they're going to be fine oh i finally got my iphone 10 back well it's not that i finally got it back i finally are made it so my face id has been broken for over six months yeah yeah yeah um so apple's rma process excellent they send you a prepaid label it appears to be like overnight because i got my new phone back in three days or something stupid like that um like doorstep to doorstep and i'm not i don't mean like in 72 hours i mean like i shipped it out midday here and got it back at the beginning of the day here like it's impressive that's pretty crazy um so that's so that's cool so i'll have my iphone 10 to compare against it i'm definitely getting um both the 10s and the 10s max uh dbrand is uh is is working on it so that's cool you guys can expect a review um you know eventually i'm at the point now where i don't know if you saw the the video that went up last night i'm assuming i'm assuming not but it was about um why google or how google forced me to make an iphone 10s video so what i had actually wanted to do was the switch stream that i did today not nintendo switch network switch yeah that's what i had wanted to do but instead i i decided to make a 10s video because over the last three years our lowest point for viewership like our weeks long lowest point for viewership was the day after apple announced a new iphone in september and i've seen people suggest well maybe it's because of back to school and that's that's a good hypothesis but apple's announcement is as much as a week or 10 days apart so theoretically if it was because of back to school it would all happen like when school goes back um and i don't believe apple's announcement is directly related to labor day also like school's been in session for a little while here yeah um and basically what i what i what i talked about was how you just kind of have to do it because as soon as someone watches an iphone 10s video you know how it is if you watch a tractor video all of a sudden you've got a bunch of farming videos in your feed and all over your homepage and everything so as soon as someone watches an iphone 10s video dude i watched a video on some guy mowing a lawn with a like a sickle yep i didn't know there was that many lawn mowing videos on the internet i just exactly it wouldn't stop and so what happens is if we don't have a 10s video then the algorithm goes well these guys are tech but not apple and this viewer is tech and apple and they start to skew the way that they feed them videos and um so so i was like okay you know screw it i don't know whatever i'm just gonna do an iphone 10s video um but i don't really feel like talking about it anymore so they're like better and stuff and also there's a 10r that has an lcd instead of an oled why is there so many different versions um well there's this there's the premium ones small big and then there's the value one all of a 10 though 10s 10x well 10 2 10 s's and 110r see we already got confused and then the 10 goes away so what's been typical in the past yeah that's that's a weird one okay my my my guess and obviously no one's done tear downs of these yet but my guess is that the 10 is just too expensive to um to to become uh like a a step down model right just they don't want to manufacture it yeah because it's got that dual layer p that sandwich pcb with all the soft like it looks incredibly complex to manufacture yeah um so that that's my guess i think that's why the 10r came about instead of just keeping the 10. i'm sure you've talked about this before but someone in chat said notch equals ruined what is your thoughts which equals what ruined what are your thoughts on notches because i don't think i care so i don't mind the notch as long as i can disable it but it actually does bother me if i'm watching uh 21x9 content if i'm watching widescreen content and i've got a byte out of the screen you might disable it um so oneplus for example allows you to just chop off the top of the display and as long as you've got an oled display those pixels that are off they're just as black as the glass around it yeah yeah so it's just gone if you don't want to not watching some type of full screen content it would chop off the notch because i like the idea of notifications and phone numbers on the iphone that's some android handset makers do do that but not on the iphone and so like playing a game on an iphone there's a freaking notch on the edge that's really stupid that's very very stupid and i don't mind the idea of the notch there if it just has phone status on the right notifications on the left cool yeah if i have so many notifications that they go all the way across then that's actually kind of what i have all the time but i'm not gonna be able to tell what's happening from looking at that notification bit anyway so we have to pull it down regardless so i don't care yeah um but then all full screen content should just not go up there that's ridiculous oh boy and that's been the debate over the last uh over the last year yeah oh this is this kind of sucks so oneplus guys are my bros um and all that heart uh but really so oneplus it seems has been confirmed yeah looks like this is confirmed oneplus is removing the headphone jack so what am i going to have left samsung is the is the lg v40 going to have a headphone jack lg v40 let's find out uh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah can't tell the site's loading slowly looks like it will okay uh with their upgraded dac so it looks like the lg v40 is gonna continue oh it's gonna have a notch bloody hill um so then like that's it like i'm not a samsung fanboy or anything in fact i put up that video recently talking about the battery drain issues that i've got note 9's actually been better lately um i'm at 66 today which is about right from when i was using the pixel 2 xl um my phone's brutal right now i need a new phone yeah i've hardly touched mine actually no i've no i've actually used mine today and it's at 66. my basically the screen has been off all day pretty much and it's raining 76. okay i mean that sounds pretty good to me from the kinds of issues that i've had but mine's behaving well right now so it's a first gen pixel xl and i've thrashed it pretty hard over the years but like what choice am i gonna have anymore word on the street google's removing it oneplus is removing it like one plus i actually had i thought they were to be the standout i thought they were going to hold out but they're somewhat at the mercy of their parent company right like they do their own thing in certain ways like their oxygen skin i think is better than their parent company's skin just hands down better um some stuff they do differently but because they're kind of a relatively small division um i think they do have to rely somewhat on the tooling and on the investments of their parent company and it looks like that's just becoming the reality in smartphones now is they need that extra space and they'd rather use it for i think oneplus statement said something about like more innovative features or something android phone equals 60 chance to kaboom that's bs what's that someone in the chat said android phone equals 60 chance to kaboom and that's just what does that even mean i think he's saying the battery's going to explode 60 of the time which is just completely beautiful that's just a stupid thing to say that wasn't a super chat was it no because that's not super that was from twitch um we gotta figure out how we're doing this because there's people that subscribing stuff on the twitch side and like we can absolutely have twitch donations too but we've never addressed anyone on twitch well i think twitch is gonna i think twitch is gonna probably boot us at some point for dual streaming and being a partner so it might not be an issue um that makes sense all right you know what let's do a couple let's do a couple super chats towards the end here and then i guess i did notice in in the partner agreement that i signed yeah it's actually only for gaming really i wonder if yours might be too oh that's interesting i'm allowed to do any form of content on any other streaming platform that isn't gaming wow or that is a game that is not allowed on twitch okay yeah so kang what do you think about apple products getting more and more expensive yet there's less and less innovation involved okay so first of all i disagree because when a product becomes commoditized it actually means that in order to try to differentiate you have to be more innovative going from 14 nanometer down to 10 down to 7 just sounds like a linear progression but it actually gets much more difficult so there's just one thing right off the hop number two is that integrating better hardware that you just get from someone else so you just buy the latest uh reference design from qualcomm and you build a chassis around it and you bolt some stuff to it that is relatively easy designing a gpu from the ground up building your own os your own cloud infrastructure for backups like the kind of stuff that apple invests in is not not innovative it just doesn't seem like it because a lot of it's in the software so i don't agree at all that google and apple are not innovating i think it's just in a way that's not as exciting to us hardware geeks that's all it's just in a way that's that's just doesn't float my boat and doesn't float your boat um and i think as it gets harder and harder yeah it gets more expensive someone someone in chat said dude you boys are the only reason i'm on twitch oh uh well we're still gonna be streaming to twitch until they kick us off and i would also take that almost the other way you can drop a platform adam okay normally i i don't make a point of calling out how much a super chat donates but adam put in 20 bucks and then says pre-ordered my iphone 10s max that so adam clearly can afford the 20 bucks because the iphone 10s max you know how much this thing is uh in canada with everything isn't going to be like over two grand for the top end model yeah is that the top end model uh i don't know well no because there's different capacities this is the pro okay yeah yeah and adam says yes i have a problem yeah no kidding um what's your thoughts on the red phone it's red no no no no oh which one is this red company not red color oh no i don't know about this what the mkbhd has been tweeting photos oh that red yeah yeah yeah sorry i see i had project red just like stuck in my brain and i was like that's why i said red company because i know that apple had a project red phone what but like project red now has their own phone that's weird so i'm pretty pissed off to be perfectly honest with you you didn't get one uh well i did i ordered one i ordered two oh yeah i ordered both skus this is a snapdragon 835 based product that still isn't here and that for some reason even though i pre-ordered at the same time as anybody else other people are getting exclusive sneak peeks with and i haven't seen haydn or haravit and the weird the really stupid thing like okay actually oh you know what okay let's talk about the red hydrogen one so i got an email from red and we're actually going to be collaborating with red on an upcoming project hopefully i'm not jeopardizing that right now but if it does then i guess that is what it is but i got an email from red inviting me to be part of a select few customers who will get the hydrogen one early for the purposes of providing beta user feedback which is not inherently a problem except for one key thing i'm just i want to make sure that i get this right because it's very important hydrogen one following up on your interest about hydrogen one is this it no uh they invited me to some event and i was like no i can't make it um where is it shoot houdini project is that what it's called yes here we go so i just need to make sure i've got the right email okay so this is ridiculous so you you get the phone early but you have to you can't talk about it so i was like well if i can't review it i don't want it early because it's not a retail unit it is a pvt sample so that is a pre-mass production unit to be very clear the thing a normal company does with a pvt sample is destroy it because it is not like industry standard not considered suitable to deliver as in as a final product to an end user now i wouldn't have a problem with this if red's intention was to take beta feedback and then take your pvt back and send you an mp unit but they are not what you are agreeing to is that you will not get a mass production unit and this is for a phone that you paid a thousand dollars for or whatever is that not ridiculous so the terms and conditions of this houdini project were just utterly ridiculous to me i already read one insane thing yeah so i i do intend to talk about that in my hydrogen one good because that one line that i read is ridiculous that is not the way you do business so anyway on that note um thank you for watching the lan show and we will see you again next week same bat time same bad channel oh wait um whoa what the heck someone just sent a 200 super chat i am blur saw dennis's dirty apartment in your recent gaming upgrade vid please use this 200 to buy him a few hours with a cleaning service and record the nastiness for channel super fun i can't we can't do something like that i mean we honestly almost got him in trouble with his landlord filming in there at all what it's a whole thing um don't worry about it but um okay that's awkward um thank you everyone for watching damon michael mitchell and i am blair you guys are very nice people how do i how do i get myself out of this nicely oh show's over
