this video is brought to you by exeter hey guys sally this is alex welcome back to the mother saucers series now if you remember well in the previous episode i made sauce polar bear for these beautiful eggs benedict so besides the heaven bliss that i experienced that traditional recipe has some very down-to-earth problems plus tradition is that what we settle for on this channel i don't think so i want to believe that there exists somewhere a way better way to make eggs benedict from scratch think of it for a moment the traditional method takes 42 minutes to make my ideal solution would be to find something that would be reliable foolproof less messy you know cleanish and very very fast hawk at first i don't want to betray x benedict either who do you think i am okay i'm a mad person yes but i'm not a lunatic properly posted runny yolk white needs to be set the sauce needs to be silky but still flowing the english muffin needs to be crispy on the outside soft in the center burnt is not an option bacon needs to have some charred marks on it now in order to make the fastest eggs benedict ever i need first to experiment let's do it [Music] there is a well-known internet trick which allows you to quickly make hollandaise sauce using a blender melt some butter in a saucepan until it's boiling hot add a few egg yolks some lemon juice and salt to a blender now bleach that at full speed and super super slowly add butter i mean that is hollandaise there is not much you can do to improve that recipe however using a whole egg instead of just an egg yolk basically make it easier because you don't have to separate the egg white from the egg yolk second boiling hot butter is not mandatory it just needs to be really hot actually i found out that i could be melting better in the microwave it's just faster but it also cuts down drastically on washing up this recipe internet wonder might taste even better than the original deal sometimes you get a love intellect okay how to poach an egg in under the time required to poach an egg if that question were to be a line of code it would explode using a microwave this is what i'm gonna play with [Music] oh [ __ ] all right let me just clean that up and we'll start again i'm sure this is not what you expected i use a bit of white vinegar just to speed up the coagulation process this time i'm gonna go for a bit more water than the first one i'm using super super fresh organic eggs you're still gonna eat that yolk raw you want the best quality possible 49 seconds the yolk is definitely cooked a bit too far 40 seconds clearly not set do it again 45 seconds the only thing that i need is a leak and a leak this is okay i'm going to call this success so as you may know i'm not just a cook i'm also an engineer who likes sometimes to over complicate things just for the beauty of it this amazing contraption is a perfect example of that it's supposed to fry bacon and toast muffins more rapidly than you would do the classic and boring way using a toaster or frying pan and it's so useful still is burning hot it's dangerous it doesn't work i also tried using a heat gun but in the end you know i had to come to the conclusion that the easiest and most reliable method using a skillet that's right so thanks to this experiment i know now that i can create a faster uh x-benedi the question is though how fast can it get and at the moment i've got no answer because i've got just a list of actions that needs to be performed i need to turn these lists into the process that would waste the minimal amount of time possible let's do this i've been establishing a gantt diagram it's supposed to organize all things in the most optimized way possible so four big steps you've got poaching an egg making hollandaise sauce cooking muffin and bacon and then plating each of this step is subdivided into actions for example for poaching an egg you need to add water to mug crack egg in ramekin transfer egg to mug place mug in microwave blah blah blah at all time i can only be active doing one thing when a passive action is happening i could be doing something actively in a different step in theory i should be able to wrap the whole thing up in under 4 minutes and 30 seconds now i reckon i've been quite liberal with a few of these steps i think it is safe to aim at the four minutes finish line enough with the theory let's go and get practical transformers assemble let's do this i've got lemon english muffins some eggs birch with cayenne butter bacon my blender knife a boat serving place a skillet on a stove and a microwave oven visualize the finish line i hope you can see the timer the eggs and that's it all right so my first attempt lasted around six minutes slightly disappointed with myself it still is an achievement like from scratch but anyway i think i can do better can i bring this down under five minutes i think i can can i bring this down under four minutes uh i can try let's just go for trial number two [Music] oh sorry that is an amazing timing ah i forgot to garnish ah shut up alex do this and this i'm gonna keep eating these eggs benedict till i die basically if you're with me guys i think we can do it let me just reset the whole station and we start again that's good why the final round alex well for a very simple reason a man can only eat so many eggs benedict and three is my limit so after this one i'm gonna call it a day as always the ingredients are uncut otherwise i could always start with pre-made hollandaise sauce who am i to you huh a joke

my only concern at the moment is the egg basically because the egg is the unknown variable in this problem i've got a leek yes let's give it a proper taste it needs to taste good that was the initial claim you remember how long this sauce is just spot on the egg is very good there's always something you can improve for example the bacon could be seared more evenly i've done this in four minutes from scratch everything from scratch i'm happy to pay a lot of money for this eggs benedict which i did because this is my third attempt but you get my point okay i think i've done my job now i'm just gonna sit at my desk and look at these dailies super quick to see where i stand in terms of timing i like the organization of the guy already four minutes one second 39 so even if i'm standing slightly over four minutes it still is about ten times faster than the traditional method and i have to call this success success [Music] now i'm gonna post this uncut version to the channel so that you guys can see that it's not a fake and i'm also gonna do that because i want to set up a little challenge with you guys four minutes one second 39 is my time what is your time and you beat me at
