hey guys oxygen OS is one plus a software it's always kept androids core functions but they make it a lot better by including their own exclusive features and optimizations today I will be showing you every exclusive oxygen OS feature that I wish stock Android had the closest device to feature a stock Android experience is of course any google pics of device so I'll be comparing the pixel three excel with the oneplus 60 first off the quick gestures are probably the most underrated features on oxygen OS I love being able to control my phone even when the screen is locked when I listen to music I can switch to the next track by drawing a greater than symbol and I can pause or play the music by doing a two finger swipe down or I can even create my own gesture to toggle a shortcut or open any app you just need to select and draw a letter and who can forget about that three fingers swipe down screenshot feature man that's sexy speaking of screenshots when you take one on a oneplus device you're able to expand it so you can capture more content on a scrollable interface this is perfect for a conversation or a social feed like Instagram or Twitter not only that but when you edit a screenshot or any picture using the oneplus gallery app you're able to customize the crap out of the image you can add filters adjust any of the images colors or features and my favorite setting is that you can mark up the photo with any custom text arrows or rectangles to focus on a specific area and if you want to blur something out mosaic is your best friend for those who game oneplus is one of the best native gaming modes out there and recently with the release of Android Q Developer Preview 3 they created a dedicated app called game space which is set to replace their current gaming mode in this settings it includes all of your games in one spot and it optimizes a ton of settings automatically when you open a game my favorite feature is fanatic mode because it optimizes all the phone's internal components blocks all notifications and calls restricts background apps and improves the network connection by disabling the secondary sim all just to provide smooth and uninterrupted gameplay that's just the scratch on the surface there's a lot more settings that can be enabled when gaming on a oneplus device twitter snapchat facebook messenger facebook uber and whatsapp all have the same problem you can't use multiple accounts at the same time without signing out first it's really annoying but oneplus has a feature called parallel apps which lets you duplicate all these social so you can quickly switch between your accounts in your app drawer now before I audible originals from an ever-changing list anyways if you're scared of your mom going through your pictures or messages when you accidentally leave your phone unlocked no problem you can use app Locker within these settings to lock any app you'd like with your fingerprint or currently enabled lock screen password if you're addicted to your phone and want to force yourself to use it less zen mode within the 1 plus chef menu locks your phone for 20 minutes so you can't use it at all it locks everything and doesn't notify you of anything until the time is up you can only use your camera the great thing is that not even a reboot will force stop this feature if you use a third-party app there are easy ways of cheating yourself out of not using your phone that's why I love Zen mode a new feature that was introduced with the 1 plus 7 pro and it's now available on some 1 plus devices running Android Q is horizon Lite it basically throws up bright lines of color on the sides of the ambient display when new notifications come in in android q you can customize the colors and it's a great addition because the latest oneplus devices don't have an LED light anymore I've always been jealous of iOS having an amazing native screen recorder something that stock Android or any other OEMs never really implemented until recently Andrew Q on the pixel has finally gotten around to it but it still doesn't work that well and it's kind of to enable however oneplus has already implemented this feature with the release of the oneplus 7 pro and it works really well the option is found within the chef menu on the home page and you can even customize the recording settings if you have oxygen OS running Android q then you can also increase the resolution to 4k even though there aren't any oneplus devices with a 4k display you can have 60fps and a high bit rate of 24 megabits per second when reading e-books or articles you can use reading mode to optimize the display to turn black and white so it's easier to read at night then when you leave the app the screen will turn back to normal this one is popular you can customize the status bar in oxygen OS you can choose to not display certain types of icons in the status bar such as the NFC icon Bob LTE Bluetooth Wi-Fi and more you can also display the network speed battery percentage change the time to show in seconds and change the battery style to a circle in the settings under apps and notifications and then data usage control you can control which apps are allowed to use your internet so if a game is using your Wi-Fi or mobile data just to bring up ads you can forbid it from doing so when I obtain a brand new oneplus device the process to set it up is really easy with oneplus switch it migrates all of your data including contacts messages photos and videos stored on your old device to your new oneplus phone lastly even though I prefer using a third-party launcher the oneplus launcher is way better than the pixel launcher in some aspects first of all it's much more customizable allowing you to change the icon pack home screen layouts swipe down to access the notifications panel and the option to disable the shelf screen plus I love the hidden space which allows me to hide any of my apps and access them quickly with my fingerprint and I can uninstall apps quickly by long-pressing on the icon and then tapping uninstall the only thing that I really missed when I switched to the oneplus launcher is the Google discover panel anyways those are the best features that oxygen OS has that I wish stock Android had there are a few more extra features that I enjoy using within this software such as navigation gestures the dark theme and the custom oneplus slate fonts but I'm sure the majority of you already knew about those features so I didn't want to show them off and waste your time either way thank you guys for watching if you guys enjoyed please make sure to smash that thumbs up button let me know in the comments if I miss any feature that you enjoyed don't forget subscribe with the notification bell turned on follow me on twitter at how to men because I tweet a lot about Android and I'll catch you guys in the next one Kapow
