I went to visit family this Thanksgiving season and while I spent the week decompressing enjoying the company of loved ones and stuffing my face with Turkey I also got a chance to read our story a memoir of love and life in China by Rao ping grew and it broke my heart here's why mr. ping grew is 96 years old and still living in Shanghai China he wrote this memoir shortly after the death of his wife who he had spent 60 years married to in it he tells their story a story that starts in 1922 and continues all the way through to 2008 when the couple was parted in death it's a story of enduring love of marriage the kind that works and indirectly the story of life in 20th century China pingu's memoir is littered with his own hand painted illustrations of his life's journey from his childhood years learning to write to his time serving in the National Revolutionary Army through marriage children and over 20 years separated from his family as he was forced into re-education through labour at middle age even the later years after returning home as his wife slowly succumbed to illness every major life moment of pingu's existence is painted for us to see as I read through the story I was struck by the simple and plain spoken style with which pingu writes he's not a flowery historian he doesn't pepper the narrative with over-the-top cliches or pontificate like so many writers today do about the wind on their face or the birds singing from the trees instead he tells you what happened when where and how this blunt way of telling the tale cuts away everything but the memories real raw at times vulnerable and taken as a whole a beautiful recollection of the ups and downs as one reaches the sunset of good days and stands on the twilight of this veil of Tears we call life looking back at fairer days and brighter climes often means memories will come and bits and pieces and with this book it's while many a veteran might have written several pages of war stories battles and great victories ping grew instead speaks of his deployment with equal measures of both combat and quiet moments when recounting a leave of absence to return home he focuses on the one memory that seemed to stick out to him the most in his hurry to leave the frontlines he accidentally mixed together his boots with those of another man in his battalion only realizing his mistake after having left the camp and noticing his right boot was tighter than the other with nothing to be done he put up with a discomfort the entire journey home this small memory adds nothing to the overarching narrative of the book but to be true there is no overarching narrative a recollection of life is often nothing but these moments that for whatever reason stay with us through the years consider this memory the first he had of his wife when they were children details and images he has kept in his heart for some seventy years young and I knew each other as children because our families were old friends but we met only on two occasions the first time we met was soon after meeting and her family had arrived in the French Concession of Han Cao and they went to visit relatives in the county of nan Chang on their way back they dropped in on us I remember her getting out one of my toys and showing her how it worked she was 10 years old after we moved here i'ts she and her family came again this time for dinner however I had eaten early and was in a hurry to be off that was in the countryside in those days there were no lights on the country roads and we took torches just as I was leaving I passed by the room where the family was eating and saw me Tong she was still a child and a smallest light one at that so someone had put a stool on top of the chair to raise her up so she could reach the table some time later Matan told me that she remembered seeing me then - you had a torch she recalled and you were flashing it on and off she was 13 as Bing grew himself rights for ordinary people life is made up of numbers of small details that stay with us for no particular reason and with the passing of time to treasured memories for what it's worth it helps that the author has such a keen visual memory I was struck by just how clearly this almost century year-old man could recall this structural layout of his wife's family's residence or his own childhood home in nan Chang County it's easy to tell why he was often in charge of designing maps during his enlistment food is a recurring motif in a 21st century driven by restaurant chains and fast-food conglomerates I wasn't expecting just how many memories a man of the previous century made and family-owned mom-and-pop diners and dance halls several pages are dedicated to reminiscing about certain meals the couple shared together at certain places during uncertain times what extraordinary Adventures these two self-proclaimed ordinary people shared together through the years if you like me and looking for an authentic story one that will transport you to a far-off land and into a far-off time to see how things used to be to feel simultaneously for a stranger and yourself to get a brief bird's-eye view of a life well-lived of a marriage laid plainly before all who are willing to consider it I hope this Illustrated memoir will eventually make it into your hands as it did mine I've been married for 16 months I have a lot to learn as a husband and maybe one day as a father Rachel and I seem to just be starting on our journey together I don't know what's in store for us though we both know we'll have our share of blissful moments rocky days and times of loss all lives after all are a tragedy in their own way a full course of suffering littered with slices of joy and consumed while on a quest for contentment Pingu muses toward the end of the story about the words pasted across the lintel of his grandmother's bedroom door happiness long life good health and peace in old age he tells us that's all people want and have always wanted I'm glad to have read this book when I did and I'm glad to have read it while the author is still living and if by some chance he manages to see this I wish him well and I thank him for sharing this story so that a man like me who has found his mitten can cherish the time he has with her [Music] [Music]
