now this isn't something that I wanted to do it's more the kind of thing that I'm being forced to do so this right here is one of the Xeon Platinum 8180 $10,000 processors from our six workstations one cpu project and I dropped it I didn't realize it was broken at the time but I knocked it off the desk and a cursory look at it showed me that it was probably okay and it booted in the motherboard that is until I realized one of the memory channels wasn't working and the CPU had a bloomin dent in the side of it so out of desperation I emailed my good friend Stephen Burke over at gamers Nexus to ask him what to do and he said well here's something you could try and if it doesn't work well at least you'll get a bunch of views on YouTube while you're breaking it so if things go wrong today you know who to blame [Music] the video description but the oh there it is oh my god how am I gonna get this out so before I show you guys how I plan to repair this very expensive and very damaged CPU I've got to get my test bench prepped to even show you guys what exactly is the problem with it right now because the thing does actually work at least the last time that I tried it mostly sort of so first we're going to need a different motherboard we're gonna need one that uses the LGA 3647 socket and this one hopefully still works someone didn't put it away properly and there's no socket cover on it it actually does look ok so we're gonna go ahead and throw this on the bench and then we will go from there one small step that I sort of missed a little bit here this one sure no what's one that's right sure wait yes good cool ok ah all right look wait what what the hell oh crap alright that wasn't so hard look at that it slides right down the heatsink fins and these two screws are what actually put enough pressure on the CPU in the socket to ensure that all those contact pads are making contact with all the pins inside so you know what we're gonna start with just one stick in dim slot a1 and see if we can even get that to go because I haven't tested this since the last time I tested it let's go over here Oh it's attented if this doesn't do anything there's kind of a chance we have no video at all right now so I'm legitimately very nervous I can't remember where it is well no it's like got to be on here somewhere there it is what what all right all right all right I get it the working theory right now because we can't see any physical damage on the outside is that somewhere in here something kind of lifted away so I figure if I put some glue in there and clamp it down maybe it'll stick together well enough that it'll work again bombs wood stone metal ceramic foam glass and more this is this falls squarely in the end more category so we're gonna use this finishing nail because we didn't find anything else lying around we are going to kind of jam it in there this is really stupid this is not going to work I think the best thing that can happen at this point is for this video to never see the light of day and trust me this hurts me at least as much as it hurts you yep you guys bought it right this is what's happening hold on that's just advanced no I'm good just hold still little seek - you promise this won't hurt a bit okay oh boy well let's leave that for a little bit how long does gorilla glee want to set one to two hours we don't have one to two hours so we'll give it a little bit here okay so here we go impossible to say if that's gonna make any difference at least until we install it everything we do from here on out David is just to satisfy our own curiosity because there's no video here all right I'm not even gonna bother putting the fan on the CPU because like it's not gonna heat up if it doesn't turn on just for fun I'm gonna pull the CMOS battery really you don't think any of this is gonna get me anywhere I'm gonna try black memory slot this time [Music] knowing fully well that this isn't going to work I'm going to try another board hopefully you let me down it's like that pure optimism that's keeping me going right now here I go again putting this thing here now this board is not even like close to fitting on this test bench it's not quite as good fries this wasn't completely just a waste of my time I wouldn't be so frustrated right now I don't know I mean we've come this far we might as well put another CPU on the other side maybe this is a dual socket board that doesn't boot with just one CPU I don't know all right I give up check out the link in the video description get 10% off shattered hopes and dreams today after you left I thought Jake was using this with unread before and he might have set it up so that the onboard video is the default and so I went and grabbed a VGA monitor and we posted its posted this works I don't have to go crawling back to Intel asking for another one to finish six workstations one CPU I wasn't recording audio I'm sorry no audio no well camera is going but it's okay everything looks normal well uh we don't know yet because remember it already worked at one point with five RAM channels so I've got to load it up Jake can I have the other RAM by any chance thank you I don't know if I deserve a medal or like a swift kick in the ass it's kind of hard to get this stick in here because of the like angle of this what is going on like everything about this whole setup is so jank what do you want Colton I'm trying to find out if I have to spend 10 grand replacing this thing or not call somebody yeah thanks did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in what is it doing hurry up can I see the post screen please raise it it works but it only works about the same as before so you can see here we've got 327 gigs of ram instead of 364 so the good news is we are booted seemingly stabili into our OS here with all 56 of our CPU cores detected and well you know eleven-twelfths of our memory also detected but the bad news is that our attempt to fix the broken memory channel did not in fact succeed so hopefully if nothing else this was an entertaining run through some of the stuff that we would normally do behind the scenes over here yeah so we're on talk like so cold right now so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join on the one hand I'm like really disappointed that it doesn't work or any better but on the other hand I'm glad it still works at all maybe let me know in the comments below or whatever should we just go ahead with five channel memory or should we like pony up and get a new one I really don't want to
