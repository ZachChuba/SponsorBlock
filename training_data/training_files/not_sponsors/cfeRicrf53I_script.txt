today also stay tuned because we're making one together on with the show Nickelodeon has been around for what feels like forever well 1977 as pinwheel to be exact with it's more commonly known incarnation in 79 but that's like forever an internet time it's been around all of my life just like The Simpsons and that's pretty crazy to think about throughout the 70s and 80s the channel was largely live-action series game shows and weird variety shows but it's the programming from the 90s that people remember and seem to Yap about in particular the Nicktoons cartoon block everyone remembers the Rugrats ran in Stimpy Rocko's Modern Life at least I hope you all do it's more likely that you'll think about Sponge Bob The Fairly OddParents and Avatar The Last Airbender but that's okay Nick's been around for so long that we've got like generations of people having nostalgic thoughts for different things all on the same network just don't say you like fanboy and Chum Chum please [Music] now with all things licensed weird products come with it be it like cups figurines cheap plastic [ __ ] or video games if you were into Jimmy Neutron by God could you get some merch I mean dang I saw some Hey Arnold to toys at a Hot Topic the other day and that was weird don't ask why I wasn't Hot Topic though so yo its Austin and today we're gonna be talking about Nickelodeon videogames in particular the bad ones now Nick shows have had games since the 80s so there's ban to have been a bunch of bad ones but today we're gonna start with one that I actually had as a child baby rocket power team rocket rescue confession time I used to like rocket power not like any time in the last decade and a half but yeah rocket power came out in 1999 which I feel was right in the middle of the extreme phase of America you know with an ox you had Nintendo screaming play it loud Jonathan and corn nut had an extreme goatee and games reflected this as well you had extreme for the PlayStation one two extreme as well as three extreme which doesn't work with the word plane theme of the first two but that's okay so being obsessed with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater dudes with tattoos and jorts of course I would think rocket power as [ __ ] watching it now is just absurd though to this day I have no idea why they thought showing random made-up words on the screen for seconds at a time was a good idea I mean it's probably like to save budget actually that makes sense rocket power is one of those shows where unreal watch all I can think about is how I should apologize to my parents the sheer amount of just grading audio that I put them through if you're watching this mom or dad I'm so sorry but yeah as you can expect with its bursts of popularity and the times a videogame would be made and the Team Rocket rescue was a big pile of [ __ ] yeah this is a 1080p video captured on an HD signal through my PlayStation 3 it just looks this bad what geneco girl Team Rocket looks about as bad as it plays actually it might play worse than it looks through all of the popping and difficult to see terrain at least the control schemes not bad I lied look I've been rollerblading before I was 9 in 1999 all right of course I owned a pair of rollerblades and before some communist decided to tear down the roller skating rink for a pool I used to go there twice a week but at least I know enough to tell you that this is not how skating works now if this were any other game I was talking about I'd be like excuse me but this is actually a game mechanic the special meter no joke freezes you in the air so you can pull off crazy tricks I guess adding a multiplier or adding interesting mechanics was too difficult oh well the story here is that rocket boards is closing down because this peanut faced morons father refuses to lower his prices to keep up with the competition so the kids decide to sabotage some local competitions in order to collude with advertising companies gotta pay the bills somehow I hope you like loading screens because that's about 3/4 of the footage I have team rocket actually has to load a victory screen for you to confirm through before popping up with another loading screen to go to the main menu this game would fit right in with the ps1 classic library there's occasional hide-and-seek collectathon missions which are a huge pain in the ass because maneuvering around is the worst no matter what method of transportation you have be it skateboard bike or snowboard it's all pretty rough sometimes you'll fail at the last second causing you to have to reload okay I failed the last mission of the game and it was like failed to save rocket boards and I have enough time to walk over to my computer pull up my notes write this entire part of the script and voice it over because it was loading for so long okay it's done I told you there was nothing to worry about well nothing besides your ears after listening to these sound effects for the last hour yeah it only takes an hour not much else really to say here I could rip it further but I mean we might as well move on oh but one last thing when you pick up items it sounds like a crystal castle song next up is a game that should have been fantastic but according to the name of this video [Music] the very recently released Nickelodeon kart racers is the complete wreck now as many of you know kart racing games are my bread and butter I don't have to say it a million times but I'm gonna Sonic all-stars racing transformed is still the best game don't even try me kid there's a PlayStation 1 kart racer called nicktoons racing and it's not great right following in the footsteps of awesome games like Mario Kart 64 and crash team racing it just fell short sure it featured all of your favorite mid to late 90s Nickelodeon characters but overall it fails to reach the speeds and well fun factor of other games in the genre it's not great but at least it has voice acting and like normal sounding sound effects here's nicktoons racing here's Nickelodeon kart racers [Applause] it's just really awkward to listen to it's not even that the audio mixing is off but when you have all of these iconic cartoon characters and they're just weird stoic emotionless models it's just absurd how the hell does a game nearly 20 years older have voice acting but okay let's not get caught up on that let's talk about other things such as this is the book of complaints that I wrote specifically for Nick Carr tracers problem number one the character selection all of your Nickelodeon stars are represented across 12 different characters we got Tommy Angelica and Reptar from Rugrats spongebob sandy and Patrick from SpongeBob Arnold and Helga from Hey Arnold and of course all four teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and that's it after all in the past 30 years Nickelodeon has only had four shows no unlockables just these four franchises and a bunch of courses based optimally but you know at the very least we get loot crate's no seriously kart racers was made by game mill entertainment also responsible for publishing that goosebumps hit an object game Dairy Queen Tycoon this exists apparently oh and let me see down at the bottom here Oh big rigs you know the one that big rigs the one we saw an ex play a few years ago infamously one of the worst games ever created if you can even call it a game thankfully Nickelodeon kart racers is not that bad but it's also not passable by any stretch of the imagination the easiest way I can describe the controls here is that it just feels awkward drifting barely does anything to improve your speeds each course feels like a repeat of the last one like someone took the course creator from ModNation racers and just used the same template over and over you gain boost meter by driving over slime or picking up items all you have to do is tap triangle to boost forward [ __ ] look at this not since Eminem's racer have a plated kart racing game so dreadful and even then I'd rather play with those low tier candy cars because at the very least I laughs about it being a shovel where we game Nickelodeon kart racer coming out in 2018 is an actual scam and ashamed you've got no special modes the menu is just three types of racing there's no intro video no nothing just a soulless title screen with stock sounding music having barely any connection to its licenses it makes sense though since this was developed by the same people who did data horrendous Power Rangers beat him up last year I'm just gonna say this game has the quality of something made for a tax break it's sure frickin feels like it the best thing kart racers gives us is probably the post Cup victory celebration goop even though it looks 300 percent wrong now kart racers aren't the only type of game that had this kind of treatment with a Nickelodeon license you know in some cases you can see that they are trying to do their own thing with their own genre and sometimes it works and sometimes the thing is so completely baffling that I feel personally obligated to find every single person responsible for okaying Nicktoons Major League Baseball and question them with one word why America's passion for baseball goes all the way back to the 1800s and I don't care sorry baseball's not my thing the only things I know about baseball is that there was a movie with Dennis Quaid that I saw and I was forced to go to the college playoffs in Nebraska one year but I stayed home and watched Tomorrow Never Dies four times instead James Bond's freakin sake oh yeah I don't know what to say I mean I will mention that it's pretty funny looking through a printed manual remember those and seeing invader zim pitching stats you see there's nothing inherently wrong with the licensed sports game the mario series of sporting games are awesome be it the slammin hard one or the kickee footy one or tennis I actually like tennis Virtua Tennis four and Mario Tennis aces are primo but you know what those games didn't do throw their characters into this weird-ass uncanny valley setting them with real ass people that's right it's not a fun arcade like powerup slinging backflip inducing videogame but a simulation like I felt like I was in a state of constant shock staring at this thick ass spongebob with his mitts as a normal looking dude was sitting there contemplating his life actually he was probably reading the constant tutorials which I could not for the life of me figure how to turn off it's like Nicktoons MLB is in constant tutorial mode almost like they're trained to sell kids the latest MLB game instead that actually makes a lot of sense maybe baseball was on the down-and-out this year and 2k was like okay the kids love the cartoons and baseball jerseys are at an all-time low in sales let's put them together and they did just that much to my dismay but there's one problem here everything has been simplified making the game feel not only less challenging but just really [ __ ] boring if you max out the pitch meter you're almost guaranteed to always get a strike against the computer and that's all you're gonna be able to play against because no one in the right mind is gonna join you for Nicktoons MLB especially not when this happens any time spongebob comes up to the plate right I put the disk in thinking I was gonna be playing some goofy rkd baseball game and I left thinking about SpongeBob's kinky Fifty Shades of Grey Aryan esque sex life I'm out goodbye we're not done here yet because we're about to tackle the extremely infamous Nickelodeon Hardy blast some of you may know the one the party with the 1.1 on IGN the game not better than God hand the 19 percent on Metacritic a licensed game so bad that I regret not speaking of it in my old worst license games video this is nickelodeon party blast [Music] I want you to think of Mario Party right except not Mario Party I want you to think about pac-man fever the game we talked about in the Mario pretty clones video now I want you to imagine that there's only six mini-games just those six but they do have a couple maps well that's this game and that's all this game is you got the one where you try to goo people there's one where you throw food at people there's one where you have to build a pipeline for your goo one where you try to dunk basketballs but end up being stuck in a giant pile of [ __ ] you get the points all very basic minigames stuffed into a full priced product that makes my heart feel like it's ceasing to function it's mostly because the controls are just janky as hell you feel like you're trying to move in a single direction but it just fights against you the entire time I played this game with my partner and the look on her face was that of despair a 1,000 mile long stare a stern look of discontent and utter sadness she broke up with me right after we finished playing and when I asked her why she simply said you know why and left it's probably because I refused to let her win you got reps from not just spongebob but also like invader zim Wild Thornberrys the works I mean Hellcat dog sits on the couch is the host of the fictional show this all takes place in even though cat dog looks utterly horrifying this game was received so poorly that the PlayStation 2 version of this was completely canceled yeah the ps2 one you know the highest selling console of all time so why the hell is an actual baby driving on the cover what were they trying to say with party blast not to mention Tommy seems very happy to be receiving a stream of Eliza Thornberrys goo I dislike the game I dislike the music I especially dislike listening to this game at all Nickelodeon party blast deserves to be firmly at the bottom of the videogame dumpster where it'll lie in wait for a poor sucker like myself to pick it up thinking hey maybe I can trick my friends into playing this the next and last game of this collection is going to be one that I found at a retro game shop in a mall for two dollars just two dollars prepare your butts for The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron jet fusion sorry I messed that up The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron boy genius jet fusion I remember being like 11 years old and feeling super pumped to see Jimmy Neutron the movie in theaters yeah not the TV show but that 2001 movie I wish I could remember anything about what happened in this film but alas I guess that's a testament to how much it meant to me I'm totally down for the concept of a science driven smart guy running the stomping grounds where everyone held on modicum of respect for the main character we already had that ship I did however find out that Jimmy Neutron is voiced by Debi Derryberry who was also the voice of vo okie and tin Chi Moyo which is a very different type of show but that's still rad nonetheless digging through this also led to me finding a movie called Alpha and Omega which looks like a furry romance movie that has Justin Long Dennis Hopper and Danny Glover for some reason also there's like [ __ ] eight of them how is this a thing this is like the Land Before Time for all you verbals out there anyway Jimmy Neutron yeah jet fusion is based off of a TV mini movie of the same name operation rescue jet fusion that means the full name of this game should be The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron boy genius Operation Rescue jet fusion that's two colons [ __ ] to the scene opens not on Jimmy but some dude named well jet fusion he's an actor of sorts and for some reason he's filming a movie on top of the set of the music video for Metallica's I disappear you know the one from Mission Impossible 2 I guess there's a bit of resemblance there then however instead of looking like Tom a--they cruise everyone's favorite Xenu fearing dillhole jet fusion kind of looks like Ricky Gervais had a really bad day like a really bad day if I sound like I'm being mean I'm just buffering you guys for what's to come oh so I just wanted to say the word dillhole that's a good word Jimmy Neutron is a puzzle platformer but it's not a very good one typically with any kind of platformer you want to have a nice and flowy jump you'll look at your Mario 64's your jak and daxters your ratchet and clanks and your bland Joe Kapoor ease and everyone has this nice arc to it some of them can even double junk which while breaking the laws of physics just adds to the fun factor now allow me to demonstrate Jimmy neutrons big-ass gravity defying job okay so I want you to imagine doing jumping platforming segments while you're stuck with that little boy Jimmy ain't no long jumping boy that's for sure okay if this game is designed around that allowing the camera to be used in a manner where all of the jumps makes sense and allow a little room for human arrow then fine whatever but it sure as [ __ ] doesn't do that Jimmy can bounce on things in order to jump higher but anytime you actually get to spend bouncing around is very sparse you can control Godard but all he does is explode you also get a few guns and create other random gadgets by doing weird brain more stuff so here's the story Jimmy gets the reality stone and makes this device that fuses the fictional world into the real one it's your stereotypical 90s movie plots spacejam or mortal kombat all over again so when you embark on your journey to save Ricky Gervais from being kidnapped or something where are we gonna be going first well the Asian Village yep that's the best we can think of not like Japanese which is what they were clearly going for with the sumo boy but the Asian Village it's a little tasteless but what else do we have you know I didn't wake up this morning thinking Jimmy Neutron was gonna be a little problematic especially the part where Jimmy's running around his school shooting his laser gun oh my god enemies seemed to have like one or two lines of dialogue in this game and if he happened to enter a room with a bunch of them you're gonna be hearing a lot of this it's cool to see where Xenoblade Chronicles twos inspiration came from the variety in Jimmy Neutron is pretty cool but it all just feels really bad Jimmy moves so slow deaths are gonna happen because the platforming segments don't seem to fit in with the engine especially these ones with floors breaking or icicles moving around depending on your positioning don't even get me started on the ladders this one part had me falling off over and over due to not being able to pull off jumps so I had to climb this again and again this looks like the right place for a snake eater joke but I won't do it not today bosses are lame and caused Jimmy's eyes to get all jaundice e running out of lives boots you out of a level entirely which would be okay if levels weren't all 20 to 40 minutes long yeah if they're not short there's less than 10 levels in the entire game so if you [ __ ] up you have to retrace a lot of steps npcs look and sound horrifying the minigames are nonsensical and some of them have this lovely sound going the entire time I always thought that the character Jimmy Neutron was kind of a dick I'm not a fan of this game by any means but at least I feel good knowing that a character who would run around tossing out um actually he's being a smartass and trying to one-up everyone gets a subpar game one that's easily won up a bull there's a ton of bad Nickelodeon games but of all the ones I played for this video Jimmy Neutron was easily the most infuriating there's not even any goo well that's all for today somebody called me when they released good burger on blu-ray thanks again to Squarespace for sponsoring today's video so let me go ahead and talk about him a little bit I've been wanting to make a website for a long time now but I didn't really have the know-how or any of that so I was stoked to find out that something like Squarespace existed I need some help and you know I just want to work together with you guys to see what we can come up with leave a message down in the comments below with what you think I should be adding to the site and I'll be back with you guys soon Squarespace is catch you guys soon love you
