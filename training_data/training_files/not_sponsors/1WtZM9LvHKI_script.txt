them both out at the link in the video description we are here in gigabytes booth where they are showing off the latest iteration of their aro 15 gaming laptop and this is actually an interesting one so it can be equipped with up to an RT x28 e max q graphics card and up to a core I 989 50 H K so yes my friends that is the unlocked six core hyper threaded processor and it's all in this tiny slim form factor how have they crammed this amount of hardware in here well conveniently the unit that I picked up actually had the bottom of it fall off while I was standing here getting ready to shoot so you can go ahead and take a peek inside with me see look it has no screws in it hold on wait for it honestly I did not I did not remove those screws the battery just started like like popping out in my hand and I was like what's going on here so here's our GPU here's our CPU here's the cooling for the vrm we've got a dual fan design like we've seen in previous generation Aero 15s couple memory slots we've got nvme storage just a single one of those no two and a half inch storage but that's okay I wouldn't have expected it there's only so much they can do for something like that but if you really wanted to add more storage look at that you've got another easily accessible nvme slot but here's the thing gigabytes main selling point for this is not actually just that they've taken a very impressive spec and put it in a compact laptop as you guys might have seen if you're paying really close attention there this is the world's first AI laptop so what exactly does AI laptop mean while they partnered with Microsoft Azir and so they're kind of working together to share the cost of development here but the idea is that they've got this demo here with us appears to be pub G running 50 45 50 ish FPS without AI and high 50s low 60s with AI now I had some questions about how exactly it would be that AI would make a game run at a higher fps and I'm gonna have to consult my notes here for a second so I asked what exactly does AI do in a laptop and they said it alik AIT's CPU and GPU power according to the workload then I pointed out that normally while gaming neither the CPU nor the GPU is power constrained and asked what benefit there would be then the answer was well you don't have to turn it on if you don't want to but it's designed to make life a little bit easier for the average end-user my next question why exactly are you running these as pre-recorded videos rather than having the actual games running to show the FPS difference okay they had a pretty good answer for that these are our TX graphics cards and in videos not letting anyone run actual games on them fair enough and then I asked okay what about other stuff and they were like okay well here's the thing it's designed to be able to predict what a particular application needs based on a machine learning data set I mean okay cool so what other demos do you have allow me so here we have an AI laptop versus a non AI laptop and they actually got rid of their their pre-recorded videos and fired up Adobe premier for me so that I could do a side-by-side test now it's Adobe Premiere cs5 and I asked why it was cs5 which is about ten year old software at this point and I said well that was what we had time for and I kind of went okay and we went ahead and ran our demo as I expected I'm not sure if I was the only one here but as I expected the AI and non AI once finished the encode at exactly the same time so really this whole experience has raised more questions than answers I asked why they finished at the same time they said well it's pre-production and I guess we're gonna have to follow up and take a closer look at the AI laptop in the future once it's had a little bit more time to Train it's AI to do something speaking of check them both out at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can go ahead and do that but if you liked it and you love AI click like get subscribed don't miss any of our CES 2019 content
