Mac or PC whichever one you personally prefer you have to admit that there are advantages to the other side let me think about it you simply cannot run say Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro on Windows and at the same time gaming on Mac OS Sox only there were some way that you could run both of them at near full speed simultaneously on the same PC oh what's that there I guess there is so behind me and Anthony is a machine that we call the indecision ater it can be a Mac it can be a PC and through some software magic it can actually be both of them at the same time as you can see right here so uh what do you say guys should we walk you through how we did it and take it for a spin I think so after this message from our sponsor Vertigo's PL 4500 RGB LED upgrade kit wirelessly connects to your PC and features tons of color customization options including audio and visual sync and more check them out at the link in the video description [Music] if you've seen any of our videos involving hackintosh virtual machines you'll probably have some idea where we're going with this if not here's the twenty second version using Red Hat's KVM hypervisor many modern computers can actually have their resources like CPU cores system memory or even graphics cards divide it up and then allocate it to multiple users or workloads using this technology you can even install two operating systems on the same computer that exists completely independently of each other as we've done in the past so for today's project then we've got something really really cool for you guys so we've taken an AMD reisen 930 900 x12 core processor and then what we've done is we've split those 12 cores straight down the middle between two virtual machines that will run Windows on one side and Mac OS on the other for graphics we've gone with an RT X 20 atti for our windows box and a Radeon 7 for our Mac then we've passed those graphics cards through to their respective VMs this method of assigning our GPUs results in relatively little lost performance so the main challenge we ran into for this project while there were many firsts and videos legendary code 43 error Nvidia obviously doesn't like consumers running their GeForce GPUs in a VM just go out and buy a Quadro combating some weird stuttering in Windows was the next issue that we had to fix and we fixed that by switching to message signaled interrupts instead of traditional electrical line based interrupts like you'd normally get in a processor these days or ever really and finally getting the mac OS catalina beta to use the drivers that Apple included for virtualized storage that last one in particular is prop really exciting because Apple has never supported it in the past make sure you're subscribed because I'm already working on convincing Linus here to let me work on a video on Mac virtualization once we get the Mac Pro in yeah we're definitely gonna be doing that anywho where things take a bit of a turn today is how we're going to interact with our Frankenstein machine so in the past if you wanted to use multiple computers you'd either have to use a hardware switcher and conveniently also call KVM multiple monitors or in the case of the LGU d 79 that we used once before you would have to be content with 1080p quadrants of a single 16 by 9 4k display today we have something quite special this display from Phillips is the 499 p 9 H and it's a 1440p super ultra wide display with a double wide 32 by 9 aspect ratio which means that what we're effectively looking at here is a bezel free single display setup where we've got the equivalent of 2 27 inch monitors side by side with no bezel in between them so we can completely seamlessly interact with both of our VMs how do you do that you might be asking well well so did you do that yeah this energy is still kind of trying to work out the kinks of their 2.0 release so I decided to use a different piece of software just kind of switched things I'll call share mouse which has some unfortunately agro marketing but hey if it works it works and for the most part although there are some glitches like you can see my Mac OS cursor is actually still kind of ghosted over here there you go and you can see kind of the header of my windows cursor for the most part it actually does work we can move the cursor seamlessly from one of our displays over to the other as if the imaginary line down the middle didn't exist in fact actually we could probably do some really cool stuff like pretend that the whole thing is one machine so I actually don't know how to switch the wallpaper on a Mac but I'm gonna go ahead and do this one nice it's an abomination isn't it beautiful oh I like this too LTTE store.com by a water bottle ok then so we're good essentially what we've got here is to rise in 5:30 600 systems but on one machine we're running Mac OS and on the other one we're running Windows with seamless Mouse movement between them which means if I wanted to I could browse the Internet over here in Safari and then potentially use an Apple Magic Trackpad for gesture control while I fire up let's say game like shadow of the Tomb Raider over on the other side wait am I just running in a circle right now yes so I'm like okay I'm bored of playing video games or whatever and I go over and I browse the forum then I'm just like oh yeah you know what I'm gonna go back to playing video games freakin nuts yeah and you can set up a keyboard shortcut to switch automatically so you don't need to Creole tap we just haven't set that up yet so let's say game play isn't your number one priority maybe you're a content creator like a youtuber or a twitch streamer and that's kind of more of your jam so what you could do then is capture some gameplay with shadow play or OBS and then port that directly over to the Mac by dragging and dropping and there you can use that if you're more comfortable with it check this out so I just grabbed the clip that I recorded right now while you're talking dragged it over the middle line and loop there it is let's see what the back looks like boom nice just like that now doesn't copy that quickly we're limited to about 20 megabytes a second so there's probably some work the developer could do on that but hey the footage is there now one thing I did want to mention is that we didn't manage to login to the App Store we think it might be something to do with our copy of Final Cut Pro being on my consumer register at Apple account and this being a developer only OS because it's still the preview but hey the point is if you're comfortable editing in Final Cut Pro you can create your content on Windows and then you can edit it together on the Mac and then you could log into YouTube on Windows and you can upload it from Windows if you wanted to pretty cool best of all if you want you can select just one of the VMS for full productivity with the press of a button and another button and another button and another button this they told us it was gonna be just like one button to switch yeah yeah they said that they could actually set it up to just switch by a single button but as far as I can tell no but it does have a KVM and that is the keyboard video mouse rendition of KBM so ready hat so what's cool about that at the very least is that if you want to use just one set of peripherals for both of your OSS you can by plugging in through the monitor right let me just switch inputs here obviously I could change it to full resolution but yeah as we can see it's being a little bit dumb and also our Mac needs to be unplugged and replugged sometimes in order to pick up this yeah that's just Apple things I think okay it's a little janky but what's cool about our setup here is that it doesn't even have to be Windows and Mac OS it's just that thanks to the Mac OS catallena beta Mac OS now supports not just virtualized storage like Anthony mentioned before that allowed us to take our single PCIe gen 4 so like this high performance 2 terabyte SSD and split it up but it even supports other verdi o devices now so we can get access to near native speeds over the network as well like imagine what it would be like to take a machine like this and be able to split something like the upcoming 16 core Raisa 939 50 X I mean even without all the PCI Express Lanes and memory bandwidth that you could get from something like a thread Ripper you'd be compromising very little janky NASA side with a dual setup like this so I mean maybe we should come back to this concept when that launches make sure you guys are subscribed and stay tuned because if nothing else we'll definitely be checking out virtualization on the upcoming Mac Pro yeah and by that time I think that there's a lot more that I could do to smooth out the experience overall like having a virtualized 9p shared drive between the two OSS that lets it basically become a network drive that native speeds but that's all we have time for today so if you haven't seen it already check out our previous Mac virtualization videos we'll have them linked below pulse way is a real-time remote
