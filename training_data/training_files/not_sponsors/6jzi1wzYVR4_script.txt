hello this is chef john from food wishes
, with the whiskey sour the hats were hide a drinkin is the best drink and if
that day happens to be a very sunny very hot day there is no better cocktail to
enjoy than a classic whiskey sour and I'm very excited to be showing my
favorite formula for this incredibly refreshing super simple
absolutely delicious drink in fact the only problem with this is it might be a
little too delicious so as they say please enjoy responsibly and to get
started here what we're gonna do first is make what's called a double simple
serve which means we're gonna add two part sugar to a pan followed by one part
cold fresh water and then once all that's in there we'll go ahead and turn
our heat on to medium and as the name might indicate this is a very easy thing
to make since basically all we have to do is bring this up to a simmer stirring
occasionally at which point that sugar should be
completely dissolved in our mixture nice and clear and that's it once that
happens we will turn off the heat and I'm gonna go ahead and transfer it into
this bowl where we have to let it cool down completely before we use it and
while that's cooling let's go ahead and talk cocktail shakers and I actually
have two both with the same design all right there's the bottom cannister and
then a top piece that has a strainer built right in which is covered by a
third piece which is the cap and while can mix the drink just by using one
of these I'm actually gonna place a smaller shaker into the bigger shaker
and then shake it this way to make my drink which I think works out a lot
better okay sometimes a vacuums formed in that top cap can be very hard to get
off after shake and then the last thing we'll need is one of these
strainers for when we serve it into our glass so that's going to be it as far as
the hardware goes and then assuming our simple syrup is cool we are ready to
move on to the software which will start with two ounces of 100 proof bourbon
whiskey which we should be measuring in with a jigger but I don't own a two
ounce one but what I do own is a two ounce measuring cup also known as a
quarter cup and then to our bourbon we will add exactly one ounce of freshly
squeezed lemon juice which absolutely must be has to be fresh okay if you're
not going to use fresh lemons for this do not make it
and then to balance everything out we will add three quarters of an ounce of
our double simple syrup followed by about five drops of orange or regular
bitters which by the way some people just drip on the top of the drink but
personally I think they should be shaken in and then last but certainly not least
we're gonna add believe it or not one egg white which I think we should
separate into a ramekin first just in case we get any pieces of shell or other
weirdness and that's it once that separated we'll go ahead and dump that
in at which point we're gonna proceed to give this what's called a dry shake and
for any shaking activities we're definitely going to need that smaller
canister on the top and we'll make sure we got a nice tight fit and what we'll
do is shake this vigorously for about 30 seconds or so so that all these
ingredients are very well combined before we add our ice because if we put
the ice in now that egg white won't emulsify quite as well and the drink
will not get as frothy as we want so we will shake that for about half a minute
and I'm not sure how well can see it but that egg does start to get a little
bit foamy and then once that set we can go ahead and finally add some ice but
not too much I'm just doing three one by two inch cubes so there's one plus two
more we'll go ahead and place that smaller shaker back on the top and again
make sure we have a nice tight seal at which point we're gonna give this the
old shake of sheikha very very vigorously for about 45 seconds or so or
until our shaker feels extremely cold and this is kind of hard to do in front
of the camera I mean normally I would be doing this up by my shoulder but
unfortunately that's too close to my face to film so I'm just shaking it in
front of me like this but as long as you're shaking it vigorously it really
doesn't matter where shake so do that any way want
I mean are after all the Tom Cruise of shaken booze and that's it after
about 45 seconds or so our shaker should feel extremely cold and that's it it is
now ready to strain into a rocks glass containing one large fresh ice cube and
I'm going to transfer this into my smaller shaker because the strainer fits
a little better and we'll go ahead and strain this gorgeous liquid over our ice
whoops if can try to get it all in the glass and if everything's gone
according to plan this beautiful white meringue like foamy heads gonna form at
the top which for me makes for a drink just as beautiful to look at it
it is to drink I mean come on how do not want to sip on something that looks
like that and then it finishes off I went ahead and did the traditional slice
of orange and maraschino cherry except because I'm fancy I went with a slice of
blood orange and a Luxardo cherry and if I was using regular-sized ice cubes that
would have pushed that down in but with this big extra large square when I'm
just gonna lay it across the top and that's it's how to make Chef John's
whiskey sour and I'm gonna go ahead and lose the fruit here so it's easier to
drink but first let me use it to give this a little stir so can hopefully
see how that egg white gives us drink a little bit of a thickness which really
does create a beautifully rich luxurious mouthfeel
which reminds me let me go ahead and feel this in my mouth and that my
friends is just one of the greatest cocktails of all time with just the
perfect balance between the whiskey the sour and the sweet elements and thanks
to the egg whites not only is this drink bright and lively and refreshing it's
also a little bit creamy and borderline decadent and yes the egg white is
technically optional in the classic old old-school whiskey sours do not include
it so if you're not into it and want to mix one of these up without it go ahead
but personally for me the egg white really makes this cocktail what it is
and of course never drink on an empty stomach so I went ahead and snacked on
my fruit garnish but anyway that's it my favorite way to make a whiskey sour and
as far as my favorite way to drink these that would be sitting in an Adirondack
chair on a hot very sunny day when I have nothing to do and all day to do it
but regardless of where and how you're gonna enjoy yours I really do hope you
give these a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient
