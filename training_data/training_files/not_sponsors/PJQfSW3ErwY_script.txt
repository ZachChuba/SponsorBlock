hello and welcome everyone to another video now today I'm not going to test a full new autopilot version or a software version but I found a bug in the system that is quite odd because it's only showing since this last update and it concerns the fact that Tesla seems to be using double speed limits on certain roads so let's find out what that means so right now I am driving a regular cruise control and if I hit the stalk whoa it's this guy doing well this is reacting quite well to that situation now as I was saying if I just hold the stalk back or pull the stall back it takes the actual speed limit so if I do that well nothing really happens now so if I slow down a little bit right I pull it again 70 kilometers an hour it displays 70 kilometers an hour but now I'm currently on autopilot and at 50 70 kilometers an hour if I enable that it jumps to 70 kilometers an hour just the way you would expect it now let's try another road or another section and see what the difference is there now first of all watch what happens when I reach that 50 kilometers an hour sign you will see that actually it changes to 50 kilometers an hour however the car says I can still do 70 kilometres an hour so it doesn't adjust the speed limit until about 200 metres up ahead now if I hold it down here you see it goes to 60 and then if I let go it goes down to 50 so same here goes to 60 and now it goes to 80 where the speed limit is 70 and then it changes to 70 again so there are different speed limits that are being applied by Tesla maybe it's different databases that you use I don't know but one more thing I want to test is whether if I hold that speed limit or if I hold the stall back and it says 80 kilometers now will it accelerate to 80 kilometers an hour yes or no so here we have a section where it happens again so if I hold the stock back it thinks I can go 80 and it actually will go 80 auto-steer repeat restricted so what if I accelerate faster nope so it applies different speed restrictions even though we were allowed to drive 60 and 80 kilometers an hour like 20 years ago that was an actual speed limit in Belgium but those have changed to 50 and 70 accordingly so I don't know where it is less getting these really old speed limits but they are apparently in the system but as soon as you let go over the stock in autopilot it actually doesn't doesn't do that anymore and it goes back to 70 kilometers an hour now same for regular cruise control so if I hold the regular cruise control then it doesn't go for that 80 kilometers an hour on autopilot it changes to 80 kilometers an hour so this is something that only happens when you are on autopilot so yeah I said I don't know where does last getting these but this is really strange behavior so as I said I don't know where these speed limits are coming from I checked OpenStreetMap because they are using that for the parking lots and the smart salmon but they're the speed limits are correct I even tried changing the speed limit temporary just to see whether or not that would have an effect on the on the Tesla so and it didn't so it it appears that OpenStreetMap is only used for smart summon and the parking lot aisles so that is not where they are getting their traffic data or their speed limit data there seem to be contradicting information and it's only when autopilot is enabled that this is actually happening regular traffic assisted cruise control it doesn't go up to that 80 kilometers an hour also this only happens with the 50 and 70 kilometers an hour speed limits it doesn't with the 90 kilometers an hour speed limit or it doesn't do that with highway speeds so it's only those two that are being affected apparently for some reason also just to make sure I checked the system and the speed limit warning and speed limit offset I put them on zero always so when I hit the stalk it is doing the actual speed limit that it is allowed so it's not like there's ten kilometers over that I sit there and that is why this is happening no for me the offset is zero and thus it should do the actual speed limit there's a lot if you're watching know that this is happening and I would very much like to know why this is happening but at least fix it so you don't start speeding if you hold it too long and get tickets so there you go another quirk and as usual if you the video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe using the button down there and make sure you click that little bell I can see you don't miss out on any new videos and for now thanks for watching see you guys next time bye bye
