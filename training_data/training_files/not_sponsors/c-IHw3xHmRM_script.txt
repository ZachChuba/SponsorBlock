infographic show illegal things that we do every day don't forget to subscribe and click the bell button so that you can be part of a notification squad one thing many of us do is watch our favorite shows and movies on streaming websites that haven't paid for the right to show that content while some of those look legal according to the uk federation against copyright theft or fact they are unlawful this is because they don't have permission to provide that content from the people that own it as a viewer fact says you are actually committing unlawful behavior by supporting the criminals is it illegal in the usa according to the intellectual property institute at the university of richmond law school yes it is uploading unlicensed content is also illegal right now people are not prosecuted for watching or uploading so you are safe to watch something like game of thrones online downloading stolen content has always been illegal but streaming seems to be a bit of a gray area nonetheless this might soon change an eu court in 2017 made what was called a landmark ruling that essentially stated that anyone watching a copied content stream is committing a civil offence according to torrent freak about half of all american millennials watch illegal content streams staying with technology and the internet have you ever used a fake name for an account apparently your nom de plume of i'm a jerk 66 is actually committing a crime according to the computer fraud and abuse act in 2010 a prison guard in the us was fined 500 bucks for using a fake facebook name while in the uk the crown prosecution service is cracking down on fake social media profiles it's not that governments want to arrest people making up fun fake names but they are more worried about online harassment and the spread of false information by people they cannot trace one more thing if you've ever jumped on someone else's wifi to use the internet without their permission you've also broken the law there are probably a lot of law-abiding citizens out there now aware they are chronic law breakers but the next one will get just about everyone the song happy birthday is not yours to sing in public although it is okay in the house the song was copyrighted in the 80s by time warner for 25 million dollars so you don't have permission to do a public rendition of it do so and you could be fined a hefty sum of money that's why you'll hardly ever see it performed in movies it is sometimes used and that's why time warner receives about 2 million a year in happy birthday royalties have you ever made a cash bet with friends well having a wager with friends is technically illegal under the illegal gambling act of 1970. this is in the usa at least but it all depends on how much chance is involved in the gambling and the amount of money if the entire amount is more than two thousand dollars you are in fact running an illegal gambling operation this is quite common in places of work where many participants take part in inter-office sports gambling especially after the boost in popularity of fantasy sports games according to online gambling site laser wager 27 of americans take part in such gambling and if you are not living in nevada you are actually risking a stint in prison and what if you won the fantasy football pool at work and celebrated with one too many drinks and then proceeded to wobble home well that could be illegal too even if you were just happily minding your own business while it's unlikely you'd get arrested in many countries public intoxication is illegal in the usa this is so but if you live in the states of nevada montana or missouri you'll be fine as no public intoxication laws exist there in texas you don't want to get caught drunk on the streets as it's a class c misdemeanor in the uk it's also an offense to be drunk in public and you could risk a fine if very drunk australia has such laws too but you are more likely to get escorted home than you are fined if you are not causing trouble as australian cops apparently take the humane approach when you get home late whatever you do don't start vacuuming the house in the uk it's actually illegal to use a vacuum cleaner after 6 pm and before 8 am on weekdays and illegal before 8am and after 1pm on weekends the australians are a little more lacks at least in melbourne where you are not allowed to use your vacuum cleaner between 10pm and 7am during weekdays and between 10pm and 9am during the weekend no such law seems to exist in the usa but in denver it's actually illegal to lend someone your vacuum cleaner according to a law website if you have noisy neighbors you have every right to sue them you may have to prove the noise reached a certain amount of decibels but if you can you can expect about 30 bucks for each day you are a victim of their loudness in this case if you've ever been loud at night and have neighbors you may have committed an offense according to research the brits consider themselves to be a very law-abiding nation with 98 of people saying they don't break laws well some other research says they break on average five rules every week or sixteen 16 250 in a lifetime these might just be small breaches but nonetheless they are laws some of the most common offenses are dropping cigarette butts on the floor and spitting out chewing gum in public places singapore was said to have made chewing gum illegal which isn't actually true however it does have quite strict gum control which means the sale or importation of gum is illegal today in the country spitting gum on the floor will also get you in big trouble in clean dubai and also in thailand where policemen have preyed on tourists who commit the act of cigarette or gum dropping in public areas in most countries littering is illegal and it doesn't have to be a lot of litter it's illegal in the usa but in alabama michigan parts of florida ohio and california just spinning on the floor could end with a fine in 2013 in england a man was fined for spitting which was the very first time a court had charged someone for such an offense staying with the brits according to some media on the subject of breaking laws the most common offense in the country is walking across a crosswalk when the little green man is not flashing 33 of brits have apparently done this a similar street crime in the usa is jaywalking which means pretty much the same but walking anywhere on the street unlawfully as some scary viral videos demonstrate this could even ignite the anger of the police you might also get an on-the-spot fine for jaywalking in germany singapore spain poland slovenia and australia the dutch legalized jaywalking in 1997 and have since reported absolutely no negative effects in many nations such as japan hungary thailand china and indonesia putting your trust in the green man could be disastrous as crosswalks are often ignored by drivers speaking of drivers the most broken law in the usa that people actually get charged with is speeding it's thought about 112 000 people get a speeding ticket every day but after seeing this video speeding might not be the most common offense has anyone out there not committed any of the offenses above better still has anyone ever been charged for one of the offenses or know someone who has let us know in the comments also
