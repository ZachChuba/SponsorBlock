this video was brought to you by rumble in the middle of the 19th century South Africa was divided into a few states the Orange Free State entrants fall both African Republic's British colonies like natal and Cape and the Zulu Kingdom Shaka Zulu had created the Zulu Kingdom in the early 19th century and they quickly came into conflict with the migrating Boers like a Blood River in 1838 but they also suffered from in fighting after shuckers death Burton Pandey with Bora helped seize the throne in 1840 but then his sons again fought for control with Sorrell being victorious meanwhile the British became more interested in the region when diamonds were discovered and the British expanded more by annexing west Greek island in 1873 around the diamond rich town of Kimberley the following year Lord Carnarvon secretary for the colonies presented a plan to turn South Africa into a confederation of states similar to what he had achieved in Canada he appointed portal for air as High Commissioner for South Africa and was tasked with putting his plan into motion in 1877 they announced the annexation of Transvaal who themselves were threatened by the Zulus and as for the Zulus fur found his cause for war when two wives of the Zulu sub chief fled from Zulu territory and into Britain's colonies but they were pursued and caught fire group of Zulus then a colonial engineer and trader were taken prisoner by a group of Zulus when they were working near the border so Fred used these to issue an ultimatum to sus wale forcing him to disband his army this was of course rejected as for a hat anticipated and he declared war in January 1879 even though the British government was reluctant to fight a war in Africa one army took a show away while another British force set up camp across the border near asonde lawanna a hill near Buffalo River but the Zulu lay siege to the soldiers at a shore way and met another army at a Santa lawanna there using a cow horn maneuver they were able to get within arm's reach of the British and using their short Spears killed most of the British Army that day since we're hopeless would force the British to sue for peace but the battle changed the opinion of the British government and the public so reinforcements were dispatched to try and restore prestige while in South Africa a British held trading post on the border was tact there at the Battle of Rorke's drift a small force of just under 200 British troops defeated a much larger Zulu army although many in Britain hailed this as a great battle that defended the borders it is unlikely that the Zulu are trying to invade in town as the King had not ordered the assault but the British reinforcements began to arrive and they relieved the troops at a Shaarawy and crushed the Zulus at the Battle of kam bulla and then they launched their second invasion and made it to the capital in lundi in July 1879 and equipped with Gatling guns and heavy artillery they destroyed the Zulus such sway was captured and forced into exile and the strongest kingdom in southern Africa ceased to exist and in the aftermath its lands were eventually incorporated into the British colony of Natal but with the destruction of the Zulus the Boers had no need for British protection they therefore sought full independence and the Boer War started one year later and thanks to rhumble for sure to join you [Music]
