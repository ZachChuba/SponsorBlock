pretty cool but you should do that too so this is bio backpack it's called Mario's house of horror and it should be sick oh just like it's right into the game I'm [ __ ] in my boy boots and this area looks a little lieutenant a soldier out of which I don't sneak up on people like that you scared me I'm the one supposed to do the scaring around here so you're a bold one aren't you come into the house of horror finding the door closed and waiting to get in anyway I see if you want to pass that door you must know the rules of the house there are three rooms you must pass three difficult challenges if by chance you ever happen to get out of the house alive and well you will find treasures beyond your wildest fantasies they'll go ahead and enter but remember the most important rule oh [ __ ] that looks sick that was really all done the moment you step inside you won't be able to exit anymore good luck Bob this is already very awesome I feel like I wasn't meant to open that before I went to the door but I am a soul of exploration what can I say this tombstone reads in memory of all who couldn't escape the house of for ease and a [ __ ] up you know I heard about someone going in the house over last year it was so graphic they couldn't even dream the romhack on and everything in this hack just looks sick I haven't even really gotten into it I'm just admiring everything that you've made it's so cool-looking the house of horror was is and will always remain opened if you happen to stumble upon a closed door please search for a staff member okay so I found the staff first alright let's let's head in hey it's a Mario game I like to jump on things oh my god this looks so good when you're like in deep focus mode the music allows you to focus actually thought the music died the first time which is oh oh look coin just turned into dust there's a lot going on here oh that's good I love these coins that turn into dust ooh I wasn't looking oh [ __ ] I like was being fooled into thinking that the Queens would help me to despite them all turning into this i have small brain oh no that's actually really scary what they slowed down I was kind of feeling I would see chairs just fly off into the distance forever until they touch something spooky table time no nope up up go into the flames I feel like the tables trying to kill me I feel like this whole house might be trying to kill me I don't know seriously impressive so far oh my god okay oh I thought it was a clock oh [ __ ] it's like telling me it looks like it's like a warning and I'm still getting hit by it oh that's a bummer you know sometimes it's hard to admit when when they get you but he got me that time I gotta be real careful not to die I wonder if his game of the checkpoint system not that I believe it needs a I'm just curious be a few years ago the thought that one of these hacks might have a checkpoint system was unheard of that's how that's how long we've we've come a far with them I mean I we come along that's fine too okay that is those gay they're gonna push me all the way off hmm I don't really know what to do and everything in the sack cuz it looks like expertly textured and so that one doesn't have a push so I think I just have to go fast three in a row so I gotta go SuperDuper quick here oh my god go let's do it be warrior all right you territory I gotta be careful I got a oh my god what what is going on here okay okay holy [ __ ] oh my god this looks not despair he's scary to be honest oh no oh no okay so I assume those little skulls mean dev and I got a jump on the other ones so it's 1 2 1 1 2 2 ok that's easy enough okay I'm not gonna forget 1 1 2 2 [Music] come on come on yeah yeah they're gonna give me a little bit of a break all right it was good I'll give it to him was it really a troll I don't know it was a broken heart and I ran right through it I think I could have done the math I gotta be careful now think about how suss it is that there's no rug here what you think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna run across the room all all yeah I believe in the no rug yeah mmm [ __ ] but thought did I miss those or they're not a hundred Kimmy's here I'm just gonna assume that that's all there was huh I think I might have been my fault with this happen all right let's do it level two what if it crashes beginning climber if I hold on I need instructions who's there another kid in the disguise of straying stow away my sweet bobbin stores best trick traders bring me one one one pieces of candy right now or you'll stay outside on the cold grits uh I know the timer we're going down I was readin but obviously I have to read that's got to be a mother lode that was a cool box wait I have not default fly physics okay didn't realize that at first yeah I'm not going quick enough I think that's a purple candy switch and penny Todd my flying foot Tricia's that's a good one I luckily you don't need them any piece of candy what it's a 111 holy [ __ ] that's good audio or this should be enough candy come in as much as I want to tempt fate by seeing what happens when they run out of time I don't really want to can't believe I tricked this kid into giving me all his candy what a [ __ ] which one of my ads which one's me very obvious Oh brick oh my god something's weird um I see it's such a royal like place is that Albert Einstein

the mirror dude can get into this is crazy there's something oh the chandelier in perhaps I can grab it no I'm on fire no I don't wanna die [Music] that's fine I had no idea where the game was gonna put me I know this hack is beautiful so many different ways and it is a little baby challenge that kind of sucks all right good these round platforms are like really well-made oh if I felt more I think I might've dead please I never dying again no frickin way I just miss the hammer like that hammer what am I saying okay last time I stood a ticket I've a non metaphorical sense yes that was a tactical last-second bunk damage negating genius oh I didn't even know they've spent this chain was here cuz I couldn't see let's go you almost reached the end of the house uh uh-huh impressive you made it out of the house of [ __ ] I did not think you would get through it very few people do anyway the exit is right ahead don't forget your prize on the way out and don't hesitate to come back any time bring your friends with you take it oh I can't see [ __ ] it we ever all scared for nothing I didn't escape dude you guys think that that door is number four all right let's go to the grave so I won't you guys think there's in number four a number four door was at this one Oh what oh I'm ready earlier and didn't realize it was a door yeehaw I don't know I did that that's so smart it's so good didn't I tell you you can never leave unless you can get out of the next room alive the room is the epitome of all your fears your nightmares you will be scared you will be scared you will have to fight but after this it's all over you escape the house you go home and you get to keep the one up it's all up to you good luck Mario no one has ever escaped this room I'm gonna look at chat yep everyone making fun an epitome that's what I thought what happens oh that's a scary thing I've ever seen okay all right it's just like a neat little hygiene this is such a cool [ __ ] credit if everyone who supported helped or bore with me throughout the duration of the sack thanks to the simpleflips discord for their precious help and thanks to the French sm64 discord for everything they've done for me I wouldn't have done it without the help of the community I hope he had fun it was so sick I loved the song the song greatly appeals to me by Oh back has done it once again we'll move on to an unidentified M music which is called Luigi mansion - one door oh [ __ ] oh this is so cool oke Gandhi hello I am professor Alvin GAD the founder of GAD labs you must be Luigi your brother has been kidnapped by King Boo you must defeat him you must collect Seven Keys before going to the balcony of the mansion here is one I do not know what lies after that the pipe led back outside and it if you stand in the middle of the green floor you will be teleported to the level okay give me that he did that did that say what I think it said wow you got a key now you can to the pension I doubt you'll find anything there without marquees though I missed a sign envious welcome to my first ever rom hack for simpleflips 10th competition my name is an unidentified mu and I will be taking you on a journey through Luigi's Mansion and its surrounding territories you'll have jump scares ghosts and cranky homeowners as you journey to save your brother as to not spoil the surprise the credits will be at the end also choosing exit course will result in a G BJ this is on purpose to prevent shenanigans you need seven stars to get to the final boss on the balcony there's no fall damage lives or 100 coin stairs have fun okay but I'm saying what if like I just go straight to the top with my expert level play can't walk give them the one one two older guys not a note Millis on therefore you need seven keys to get in door there are six in the level and why don't you got slab which you should already have I'm trying to find this big dough somewhere where's the [ __ ] does do did maybe this isn't actually a level I'm just exploring the hub I'm so stupid I just explored that thing for an hour thinking it was the actual level high green mario as you can see king blue destroyed this town a long time ago i found that this house was undamaged so I live here now the only other person is this old crank that lives in the mansion at the end of the road he works for King Boo so be careful also there is an interdimentional hole over there so enter at your own risk you believe I was digging the hack before I even knew a custom level existed how easy a ma'idah please actually not anything about it it was so you to match what I like which is unique takes on levels I already exist that's like something I really enjoy damn I'm floating around dude I'm like a butterfly but I was really thinking like I can see one star being here but how is how am I gonna find six stars there's one I just follow the [ __ ] coin where did it go oh there's [Music] that was a straight screenshot from a 1:27 brother no one would ever be ground-pounding in that spot if they hadn't just wall kicked off the wall I love slighty Luigi oh hey I like this like concept stairs they're all crazy I I hope I am not alone in thinking that I was just running up to a penguin for a moment there please just one other person think that that was a baby penguin okay I'm ready to go down he was kind of cool without a body hey Luigi I possessed King BA mom awesome right he was weak though because his body and soul shriveled and died very quickly but it does not matter his living corpse will be enough to take down you all so I got some of his slaves too how do you expect to beat us when we are four and there's only one old fat you you far did I get that ghost or like evil and [ __ ] but I gotta be mean to backflip you're in the air for so long [ __ ] welcome to an alternate dimension there are two stars here one is in my house if you can find it and the other was on top of the old mansion you're gonna climb on top using the palm tree that is growing in midair be careful where this is king dedede's domain okay that weird bit of a twist on the old the old tale I thought that was a float for sure oh oh okay that was an accident it's cool that you can go back though if you wanted to it's not the house when you're standing next to I swear I mean it's just different to you know missing one star can't remember if I needed seven or six okay one day one day I'm doing it mark my words quote me now one day I will successfully get up there holy [ __ ] this is quite an increase in difficulty a little bit out of my comfort zone with the different jumps here I honestly didn't tell whether or not I actually needed to wall jump here I cannot see what I'm leaning on oh nothing I guess what who makes that noise certainly not Mario or Luigi okay so what's the goal laying on it how thick is it it's a bit thick [Music] I don't understand unexpected slope if you can't figure this next part out watch me beat it at youtube.com / link is also in the reading I mean I'm a [ __ ] genius oh my god holy [ __ ] that's probably not intended let's jump in and blow that but I think I can do it oh I was so close honestly guy who made this isn't gonna like this but I think I can just make this gym very dude hey Luigi I possessed Bowser pretty cool right well it doesn't matter I'm gonna clap your cheeks either way it is pretty cool I suppose that is rather sad but Bowser can clap his own sheets on this break Oh wonder ouch oh [ __ ] what this is in big lose client won't be done yourself into that Mario oh [ __ ] custom Boston I don't think so oh wait if it you don't know what the what the textures gonna be that's kind of cool I don't want to I don't want to learn what the other ones like
