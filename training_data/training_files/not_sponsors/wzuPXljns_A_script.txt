Hey so headaches can be located on one side or both sides of your head they may be intermittent so they may come and go periodically they can be episodic so they'll come on for a longer period of time and then go and then come back or constant so just all the goddamn time some are cute so they come and go rapidly while others can be chronic and persist for days or weeks where you feel your head is aching may tell us something about the cause so for example if you feel pain on one side of the head and around your eyes it could be a cluster headache cluster headaches are rare anyone can get them but they're more common in men and they tend to start when a person is in their thirties or forties and cluster headaches begin quickly and without warning the pain is very severe and it's often described as a burning or piercing sensation on one side of the head and like I said it's often felt around the eyes around your temples that sometimes face and it tends to occur on the same side for each attack the exact cause of cluster headaches isn't really known but they've been linked to activity in the hypothalamus and also people who smoke seem to have a higher risk of getting closer headaches some cases also appear to run in families which suggest there may be a genetic link because their headache attacks can also sometimes be triggered by drinking alcohol or by strong smells like perfume paint or petrol and then if you feel deep constant pressure like paint in your cheekbones forehead or at the bridge of your nose it could be caused by your sinuses some people may find that the pain can get worse with sudden head movements or straining sinus headaches are often caused by cold sinus inflammation or other viruses or bacteria and then we have what's commonly known as caffeine headache and I used to get these all the time before I stopped to decaf if you are drinking a lot of tea or coffee and you suddenly stop you are likely to have a caffeine headache and these are normally felt behind your eyes or at the front of your head around your head attention headache is the most common type of headache it may feel like a constant ache that affects both sides of your head you may also feel the neck muscles tighten and a feeling of pressure behind the eyes it normally isn't severe not ready from doing your normal daily activities and most people are likely to have experienced a tension headache at some point in their life women do tend to suffer from them more commonly than men and some adults experience tension type headaches more than 15 times a month for at least three months in a row which is known as having chronic tension type headaches so many different things can cause tension headaches like stress and anxiety squinting poor posture tiredness dehydration skipping meals like a physical activity bright Sun like noise certain smells the list is endless I'm finally the last kind of headache I want to talk about is probably the worst kind the thunderclap headache a thunderclap headache is a severe super severe headache that peaks with them like the first 60 seconds of onset so a sudden blinding headache probably unlike anything you've ever experienced before the most common cause of this kind of headache is a subarachnoid hemorrhage which is a type of stroke caused by bleeding on the surface of the brain which is caused itself by a burst blood vessel in the brain or a ruptured brain aneurysm because of bulging blood vessel has burst and released blood into the space around your brain lots of some pressure is put on your brain which is why it aches so suddenly so if you ever feel a very extreme blinding headache appear out of nowhere please please please call of ambulance also the lifestyle habits subscription to view all problems in the archives and that's it if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you want to see more like this click subscribe and a big thank you to my page on some patreon and thank you for watching bye
