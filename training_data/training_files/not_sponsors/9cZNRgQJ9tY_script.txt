- Aww~ She's so cute❤❤ So I thought, 'I want to have a happy-go-lucky life like Dui'!! So that's why I'm showing it! Q. I heard that you're scared of dogs, do you, Yeri? I used to be terrified by dogs, but these days, I sorta overcame it! So dogs like Dui can be true friends with me ☺ (Yuri's National Dui Brag❤)
My Dui also has a unique appearance~ You know Taeyeon's puppy, Zero! (Dui is a silver poodle, the same kind of Taeyeon's pet dog, Zero) Oh! A toy poodle! (I know Zero..)
Don't they look different? Dui has a bit unique look.. But that makes her more charming~🌟 I recorded a show with Dui! (Ddu Ddu's friend, 'Dui' is about to make her debut)
