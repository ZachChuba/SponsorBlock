platform to build a beautiful online presence look I love free speech I think it's beautiful that we live in a country where you can say anything well within reason I mean I think it goes without saying that free speech should have some limits and today I'm going to explain why see there's some speech that I personally feel threatened by particularly opinions that for any number of reasons I find problematic and I think it's good when social networks block these kinds of people but honestly it's not enough we need government action now Wow you got here quicker than expected oh I heard someone was in danger what direction did you see the bad words that way I saw him that way officer Koch Adam I mean can you really what people walking around saying things that are obviously untrue people are impressionable not not me no no I I'm smarter than most people and that's why I'm advocating on this on the stupid people's behalf they don't know they need this protection I'm telling you the moon landing was faked the moon it's just a projection no the moon landing and the moon are both very real that's exactly what I'm calling what's the problem here oh it was a joke oh it officer you have two options right now either you recant oh you tell me who said this to you like for example there are still people walking around saying that the earth is flat that makes society dumber okay it's implicit pilots do I want my kids to grow up in a world where people espouse these Flat Earth views give me a break no just shut it down now before it gains more traction please with me the earth is flat in the globalists then I want you to know it let's just have a law where everything you say has to be the truth I mean why not who would object to that I'll tell you who liars that's who so let's just do it come on lawmakers you cowards I'm going to tweet you until you do something we can just set up a Ministry of democratically elected leaders who discern what the truth is and then it's their job to censor whoever it is that's not telling the truth all right next case let's see this says that you told your wife you pick up a pizza on the way home no I I never said that nah yeah you did I mean it's your word against hers so one of you has to die I knew I was working late so as I wouldn't have said that I could you know get a pizza no you said you were gonna pizza I leave I don't have time for nice frivolous lawsuits so I've made a list of everyone I believe who should be done away with please pay attention as what I say is gospel as we have already established adjust to your life accordingly number one fan anyone who has tweeted anything offensive I don't care if you apologize or if it was years ago I really don't the fact you said something offensive at some point means you might strike again and my perfect utopia cannot risk that happening so you're gone number two man anyone who has incorrect political views this means a lot of you are you're gonna lose beloved family members but I promise we will all make new families in this beautiful tomorrow we will build number three band one who makes jokes look I know that this sounds extreme but think about it most jokes are at someone's expense when are we finally as a society going to say that it is not okay to make fun of people at all what's funny about that huh look you don't want to be on the wrong side of history on this one so just go along with it it's gonna be a thing number four ban anyone who spreads misinformation this is assuming that lawmakers are too cowardly to pass my tell the truth law at the very least can't we all agree that people who spread misinformation should be in jail can't we at least agree on that and finally number five ban anyone who holds incorrect opinions and you might be saying Jordan that's so subjective it's really not because it's just the opposite of my opinions couldn't be more clear I can provide a PDF of correct opinions if anyone is interested out there link in the description but really if if you have to ask for it you've probably already been banned Wow great so I guess that mostly covers it let me let me just look at the list one more time yep that that leaves just just me with the ability to express myself freely like I said I love free speech hopefully I'm right because I'm all you've got or else stay tuned for bloopers guys the [Music] he doesn't even speak I've never liked pizza you know this new sendest you why are the options recant or tell me
