[Applause] [Music] we are back in Porto and it's actually the 28th of October so we're filming on a day that loo actually already edited video and uploads the video but that's because we were told that there's a really cool thing happening in the centre of Lisbon our centre of Lisbon Wow I'm tired so I'm sure of Porto it's called la tada I think right and it's like the day when the freshman at the University they get all dressed up and they're in normal uniform which is actually the universe fired JK rowling for harry potter but that's besides the point today they are celebrating and representing each of their houses at the school by covering themselves in cans and I guess cheering for their house and making as much noise as possible and people who make the most noise as possible win and I don't know if any of that is true but I think it is and yeah we're gonna go in and see the city I don't know what I'm gonna draw yet but something hopefully festive and I think it's gonna be very loud there so we thought we would tell you what's going on in a quiet alley before we get into the chaos [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] first
