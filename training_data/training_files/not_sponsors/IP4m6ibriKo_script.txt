images and data telling the story of the human race and alongside these images sit 90 minutes of music 27 songs taken from cultures all around the world and put on the record for thousands of years these songs will drift through the cosmos a testament to human creativity among these songs are traditional folk tunes from across the world and masterpieces by some of the greats in all of history Mozart Bach Stravinsky but of all these songs there's one in particular that I find eminently fascinating and painfully human Blind Willie Johnson's dark was the night cold was the ground let's take a closer look [Music] selecting the songs that would go on the Voyager Golden Record was a complex decision how can you sum up all of human experience into a few minutes of music one of the astronomers tasked with making this monumental decision was Timothy Ferriss it was he that decided to launch a short instrumental piece by a poor blues man off into immortality he said that he chose Blind Willie Johnson's song because it reflected an eternal part of the human experience he said Johnson's song concerns a situation he faced many times nightfall with no place to sleep since humans appeared on earth the Shroud of night has yet to fall without touching a man or woman in the same plight it's a reflection on some of the more painful sides of human existence and these are sides that Johnson knew well we don't know that many details about Blind Willie Johnson's life but what we do know is tragic Johnson was probably born in Texas in 1897 as a child he started to play guitar hoping it would help him on his path to becoming a preacher you see Johnson was a devoted Christian and wanted nothing more than to spread the word of his faith this is a devotion that he kept throughout his entire life no matter the tragedies that befell him the first of these tragedies came when Johnson was just seven years old as the story has it Willie Johnson's father had been having an affair and when his stepmother found out she threw lie in Johnson's face blinding him for life without his sight Johnson devoted himself to the guitar by the time he was a teenager Johnson was already busking in the streets with a cup tied around his neck he would belt out in a gravelly voice sure to catch the attention of listeners the songs that Johnson sang were a mixture of originals and traditionals blues songs and old spirits he channeled his life experiences on songs like on motherless children have a hard time no body on earth you take another when mother did it wasn't all biographical though many of the songs that Johnson song reflected his aspirations and his faith they preached to any who would be his audience you can hear this in songs like John the Revelator or Jesus make up my dying bag [Music] the pain of Johnson's life is reflected in his raspy voice like the archetype of the weary blues man but even more impressive than Johnson's voice was his slide guitar technique using a pocket knife as a slide Johnson managed to push slide guitar further than any had in his time this was one of the triumphs of dark was the night cold was the ground blues researcher Steve cult explained that Johnson's Gray's strengths were his timing and tonal control Johnson would often speed up his slides as he went and he was able to slide around three or four notes on a single hit of the string this works wonders in dark was the night by moving around to a number of notes on one pluck Johnson creates a sense of other worldliness like the music is present but not being played Johnson also used his guitar to harmonize with himself the chorus of Lord I just can't keep from crying shows this off well he creates a three-part harmony between his own voice the voice of the backup singer and his guitar in dark was the night the guitar pairs with the Haunted vocal lines the lack of lyrics in dark was the night make it that much more powerful it's not an emotion that Johnson needs to explain it's not a sentiment tied to any language at all it seems to come from a time or a place outside of language it's pure human expression and though this pain is pulled from Johnson's own experience the story the song tells is actually biblical Johnson took the musical structure and title of this song from an 18th century hymn called Gethsemane that hymn tells the story of Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane the night before he's crucified but somewhere along the line Johnson abandoned the lyrics of the song replacing them with simple primal moans it captures the inexplicable pain of a man condemned to die but also the connection to something greater the connection to the divine the connection to the universe around us Johnson was probably paid the equivalent of 20 or 30 dollars for laying his soul bare on dark was the night it was one of 30 songs he would record in his career the standout song for most people these songs were recorded between 1927 and 1930 and helped Johnson reach modest levels of popularity but as the twenties ended of the u.s. plunged into the great depression and Johnson's career waned we don't know much about the later parts of Johnson's life but we do know that tragedy struck him once more in 1945 Johnson's house in Beaumont Texas burned down another blow in an already difficult life with nowhere else to go Blind Willie Johnson laid himself down on the cold wet ground in the burned-out remains of his home dark was the night and cold was the ground when Blind Willie Johnson died he caught a chill from the cold and died of pneumonia on that ground probably no older than 48 Blind Willie Johnson's life was short and painful but he lives on through the music he used to preach those recordings became Johnson's last Testament and they grew to influence musicians who would in turn shaped world history and now more than half a century after Blind Willie Johnson's death his music soars through the heavens an eternal portrayal of the painful reality and fragile beauty of human life Blind Willie Johnson is just coupon code polyphonic to let them know that I sent you [Music] [Music]
