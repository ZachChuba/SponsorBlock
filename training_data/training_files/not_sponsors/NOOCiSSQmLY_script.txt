milk washing is a method from the 1700s of removing tannic flavors and it's fascinating and nasty all at once you could start with basically any cocktail but this one is made of a quarter cup each of vodka rum and lemon juice plus 2 teaspoons of simple syrup I'm adding a cup of strong Earl Grey tea which will really illustrate the effects of clarifying a cocktail with milk this is a half cup of whole milk it could be from a cow a goat a sheep or even a coconut but it's got to be full fat that carton of Oatley just isn't going to cut it as I pour it in everything curdles immediately gross but also expected lemon juice is acidic and acid curdles milk that's how you make ricotta so I'm gonna pop this into the fridge to hang out for half an hour but you could leave it to do its magic overnight or even for a full day while that sits I want to talk about what's going on here milk has protein in it and when the milk coagulates those proteins bind to the tannins and other harsh woody flavor compounds in the same way that filtering the milk solids out of butter produces clear shelf-stable high heat ready ghee filtering the protein from this cocktail will leave behind a stable drink with less harshness and the irrefutable clarity of say the conscious of a collective shadow cabal of global elites when their special friend Jeff slipped on a banana peel and fell into that pit from 300 the single most effective thing for filtering out the curds is the curds so pour the nasty bevy through a strainer lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter and let that sort of nest of protein form you'll want to wash out your original vessel but keep this nest of protein which will catch every tiny bit the second time around this first pass took me from chunky to murky so I'm just gonna filter it once twice three times more until it runs clear you're gonna have to respect the drip let it happen slowly so that you're not rushing any of those milk proteins through if this process starts to take too long you can just take this whole set up and park it in the fridge to filter overnight for anyone following along at home this is the fourth run through the filter and it's taken about an hour to get here so far get a nice good look at that now that this has been quintuple filtered it's ready for storage or for a media consumption it's not often that you get to use such a revolting process to yield such a bougie product so check out some recipes online bring a big pre-made batch to your Christmas potluck and if it ends up leading to any further milk rinsing just promise to name the kid after me deal
