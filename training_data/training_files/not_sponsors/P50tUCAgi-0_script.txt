I invited you to ask me your selfies so I could redraw your face and it turns out you guys are as much of a glutton for punishment as I am considering there have been thousands thousands of these sent him you are so beautiful but not for long if I can help so how's it work you ask well Aaron let me show you step one copy your face and paste it in Photoshop step two use the lasso tool and circle everything on the face that is your face and then use some photoshop magic by right-clicking select fill and selecting content-aware fill hitting okay and then your face is cool sometimes it leaves some stragglers but there it is your hideous faceless face this is then the foundation that we work from to draw faces on your faces but it doesn't have to be a face I mean in a situation like this I'd be more tempted to it's just drag mystic crust and after a bit of flattening we can quite simply turn your face into what it was always trying to be been a stop beautiful and a beautiful segue to encourage you to hit that thumbs up button and like this video as we get stuck into the activity about that device at the end of this video now moving on to today's activity I've actually recorded this video before and lost the talk to camera video but I have the actual creation of people's faces as part just not the talk the camera bit so instead of non-use because it doesn't have to talk to camera camera basically I'll cut back and forth and I'll start off with one that I've already recorded so you can see what I mean some will include me talking to the camera like I am now and wherever it doesn't it's because it's the best video I already made and and lost the files for that was a fun day we're redeeming about having extra fun right now hey Cody it's a lovely selfie Cody you're a lovely person and now I'm going to destroy you now you tweeted this at me with the caption smiley closed eye emoji I'm just gonna copy that emoji seems you think that that's what your expression on your face should be we're just gonna make sure it is aside from following the silhouette of the actual shapes of the emoji we need to add some details so make sure we have just some lines around the eyes and then we hide the emoji you'll see ET illusion says good luck you think you could throw me off just because you used a distorted reflection of your face I don't give up like that I'm just gonna do a slightly less conventional thing and draw that distorted vision your face if it was actually a geometrically accurate representation of your face there's like there's a weird like double distort with the eye here I'm just no 10x like the bags so as much as you're trying to hide behind a sort of reflection and your phone sorry I have to expose you that's right I know your secret I know who you are and all I have to say is I'm so sorry for your loss Quasimodo oh no Quasimodo what are you gonna do now that the not your dumb Cathedral is gone look at this baby who's next sending a photo of your dog doesn't count and that's Kermit the Frog not you I meant above you you're Kermit the Frog you will knock him at the Frog yet Oh Anna why do you let me do these things to you sorry Evan it's Kermit I'm gonna add in these classic Kermit eyes yeah we use our reference pictures so using the color grab of Kermit's mouth there and just like that we can hide our reference parts and bring the original up to full opacity wait no no no no it's something very wrong with this there we okay that's better much better oh hi Carly's turn alright let's uh let's cover you the next step of course is to replace the face with nothing now your face is inspiring me because of your hair I'm just reminded of Hades from the hercules cartoon so I was gonna bring in a visual visual reference here there we go I think they're slightly predatory looking creepy face that Hades has on now is this perfect you must be Hades relative in some fashion you guys go way back you are rockin in the underworld and some of the colors add some pink around the eyes and just like that we have lost relative in haze oh it's so beautiful I'm scared says Kailyn that's cheating you're using filters to hide your real face what is it what is this nose what are the bit what are these years this is the best policy and I'm sorry to do this to you but I'm gonna have to show everyone who you really are the content-aware fill makes everyone's face looks like near in the matrix when I like his mouth it's cozy in fact you see the filters Kailyn as we all know you're actually hiding all the details and lines on your face when you strip all that away it really shows what's underneath you know finally enough I thought the nose in the ears with the fake bit but turns out they were the only real thing about you Kailyn hashtag comes like oh oh Tobuscus it's very interesting selfie and I'm struck by the lack of shape and detail but I like the face so they keep me there and I'm gonna find someone to put that expression on Sam Sam doesn't have a face Sam buddy it's alright I got your face I fixed this Sam I gave your face you're welcome I had lying around Zaki quack is this silly enough I mean it's not particularly silly it's just really unclear what I'm looking at I need to be easy to understand if we're all in the shot so I'm just gonna fix that just bring my eyes in don't worry Zaki quack hold your stare fix that right trick now is to round it all out you just make people know what the structure of the image is very unclear actually use up you're missing your nose there so I'm just gonna come back in here grab your nose just oh my god Zachary quack why are you sending in nudes that's that's not what I asked for it's alright I can fix that I can make it family-friendly already much better see it's the same it's the same picture it's just a lot clearer this time Baden Lich has got quite the expression on here love it got the foundation now we're gonna work on that and hey didn't correct me if I'm wrong but you seem to me like the kind of guy who hits the clubs and gets the ladies in fact that used to be my signature pickup face but we can amplify it that's how you're gonna get more ladies hating amplify the pickup face feel like I can even amp it up a little bit more let's just grab the eyebrows and totally just there we go see if this is the same expression I just amplified it very slightly alia is a poet and there's someone from the community saying you are gorgeous I'm so glad everyone in this community is so nice to each other obviously excluding me look at that that's beautiful blends in really well so I think we're really just strengthening your silhouette here we have a really nice strong draw and a really confident why am i I browse I think this is good but the only thing holding me back are your lips for some reason I feel that let's just carry that direction I mean oopsy dot jpg thought he looks gorgeous before but after huh check out that mug to get it kids holding what is it with people distorting their own faces that they send in to the point that there's not much worse I could do to it I mean like guess it's a defense mechanism because they're worried about how brutally I'm going to damage their faces well the joke's on you Becker I'm gonna do a reversal I'm gonna bring your whole face totally back to normal to do this we paste the frame of the face and now it's going to go over to liquify tool and in here we can reconstruct the proportions of the face now the eyes are too big so really we're gonna have to bring them back to normal proportions so I'm just going to stretch it out to normal human head proportions now that we've normalized the proportions you can see there are obviously some things that Becker was hiding namely the fact that she doesn't have a nose and she obviously gets lip filler injections that's okay Becky you don't have to be self-conscious about it I can fix that I'll just give you the nose you've always wanted my nose that's right if there was ever a beautiful nose to wear on your face it was this way so you don't have to be self-conscious anymore you don't have to hide I made it okay oh my god sorry pug master 22 as a master of pugs it's only fair that your transformation be complete we're gonna have to do a little bit of doctoring of this image first of all we have to remove the post so you look at that I have a bit this is a perfect foundation there was never a dog we let the Photoshop magic continue by grabbing your face and completely removing it pug time and bring down the opacity here we go gonna make sure we get the lovely pug gels in here look you look like a character from goofy there's the goofy cast and then in the middle between our two nuns here is your face the missing goofy character ah that's beautiful now I know what you're thinking Jezza it's not fair it's not fair that you spend all this time disfiguring a dozen of your innocent followers that would be true if I weren't willing to do it to myself all right selfie time you ready there's me face we're gonna make it ready to edit so I'm going to get just like a nice flat normal face shot there it is got a selfie now I'm gonna edit it and I mentioned at the start of the video that I will show you guys how this thing works and this is a perfect use case when you guys want to just figure your own selfies so this is actually really cool I've done this a couple of times before the HS extend in the same way that you would plug this USB into a laptop or your computer you can actually add the adapter that comes with the HS 610 and literally just plug it into your Android phone this as a pixel - and rather than using my big fat fingers to draw on the phone where you can't see behind your fingers and it's not very clear now I have the ability to use this like I would on a computer literally I've just plugged this in and look at that I have a mouse I have a cursor I am dropping on my phone with the HS extender it's super cool oh there's me face I got it a sketchbook doesn't have that magical fill-in feature that Photoshop does but we can do that quite easier so as you just get the little eyedropper tool then we can just brush over the facial features just like that you have to just make sure to re eye drop as you go just so that you can move the shade ingredients of the face oh I need a shave or do I maybe I need to grow more of a manly beard trust me if your wife doesn't like your having a beard you don't have the beard because otherwise you don't get kisses I'm gonna read you all the face and I had the beard and I'm not going to to change the nose because the nose is a let's face it iconic feature if you've wondered what I look like if I held a little bit more masculinity on my face well we're gonna answer that today let's give a nice ink brush it's fountain pen it's pretty good look at that oh my god just the fact that I have those 8190 levels of pressure sensitivity on this tablet on my phone ah so good anyway let's finish this baby off and give myself a little bit of a dopey grin and I know what you're thinking jazzy you would mean or a little over the top with other people's faces you're just giving yourself a handsome beard well let's get silly oh no I'm sorry silly after this here's the eyes oh that's not how eyes look is it no and it was let's go Debbie oh they're too far apart you just look silly now jaza I can laugh at myself too you guys okay look at that silly face just going to add the dribble Yuval in the mirror oh that's insane nuts the point is I did it to myself to Ferris bear and also how cool is it that I literally just did that on a drawing tablet that would normally plug into a computer or a laptop but just by plugging into my Android device I could just draw in the way I am comfortable doing with the pad tablet and like I mentioned earlier in this video you can get 10% off for a limited time by using the code jazz' 610 at any of the official shop links in the description that is it for my violation of your faces I hope you enjoyed it if you did and you want me to do this again let me know in the comments in the description and if you want to join in or do it again then you can send your selfies to me on Twitter but don't tag me on Twitter cuz then I'll just get a huge brush mint of faces and won't be able to interact with people of my feed normally not that I don't love your faces but just use the hashtag R to find my face instead of tagging me directly just use the hashtag I'll find it and I'll do it that way next time because I haven't been able to function normally on Twitter for the last few weeks I love your faces they're just a bit much sometimes well that does it
