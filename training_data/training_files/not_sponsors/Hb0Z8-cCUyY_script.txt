this video is brought to you by skill share our pop culture landscape has over time grown deeply distorted now I'm not saying that the content of the music we listen to is toxic it seems to me that the problem is rooted in the very mindsets and lifestyles of the musicians we listen to and idolize these unhealthy habits and constant controversy produced disastrous results as seen in the public breakdowns of hip hop pioneer Kanye West and the many documented cases of musicians abusing their status for sexual favors in this vast ocean of controversy and gossip there remains but a shortlist of musicians who choose to keep their personal business private and Frank Ocean leads the pack Frank has become one of the most beloved artists of the 21st century and in this video we're going to take a closer look at his career than the philosophy that powers it a firm dedication to the separation of personal and public personas let's get into it Frank Ocean was raised in New Orleans where he was inspired by the city's vibrant jazz culture from a young age Frank moved into his dorm at the University of New Orleans just a few days before Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 his newly built hard-earned home recording studio was destroyed in the floods he decided to leave his education and family behind and headed to LA with a thousand dollars in his pocket intending to stay for six weeks while finishing up some recordings he had planned while he was there he made contact with a number of people in the music industry and was able to land a permanent job as a songwriter Frank wrote songs for Justin Bieber Beyonce and John Legend he made a good living this way for several years in the late 2000s in his own musical career began in 2010 when he met Tyler the Creator and joined the now infamous hip hop collective Odd Future Frank Ocean has put out four full-length projects to date and he's only become more reclusive and enigmatic with each passing release his debut mixtape nostalgia ultra came out in 2011 news was met with immediate acclaim the tape sampled songs from Coldplay MGMT and even Radiohead some of Frank's favorite bands from the young adulthood nostalgia was praised it's lyricism that focused on personal reflection social commentary and Frank's past relationships channel orange Frank's first studio album came out the following year it was a more refined effort than nostalgia ultra produced mostly by Frank himself with assistance from Pharrell Williams and Al maaske the record blends a number of styles together to create a fresh take on our be drawing from the funk jazz and psychedelic styles the lyrics are complex and intimate discussing Frank's personal experiences with romance drugs and modern decadence channel orange won a Grammy Award for the best urban contemporary album of 2012 proving that Frank's unconventional style and creative process wasn't lost in the court of public opinion it was around this time that Frank decided to take his already bare-bones public persona even further off the grid in 2011 and 2012 Frank took around 15 interviews most of them were casual Affairs touching on little more than his musical influences and newfound success he only got personal with the press a few times most notably in his late 2012 long-form GQ interview which is coincidentally one of the last times he would interact with the press for years in the interview Frank discussed his tumultuous childhood and ambiguous sexuality two aspects of himself that while fascinating to fans have nothing to do with the music when the GQ reporter asked if he were bisexual Frank's answer bordered on aggressive he vehemently defended his right to privacy as an artist claiming that his only job is to communicate his experiences through music and nothing more the Frank deleted his Twitter account a few months later it was a controversial move for sure Twitter can be the primary method for an artist in public figure to communicate with the outside world in between projects but it's also a distraction Frank provided nothing in the way of an explanation save for a single word in response to a fan questioning his decision on tumblr intuition it would be more than three years before Frank Ocean dropped his next album blonde and the wait for it was torturously long artists today tour endlessly dropped singles teased fans online and stir up drama to build high Frank did none of that but to help him found itself caught up in controversy anyway being plagued by demanding fans and rumors for years when blonde was confirmed to exist in July of 2016 after years of speculation and rumors there were yet more delays and it didn't come out until late August blonde was immediately praised as a masterpiece it received rave reviews and was unanimously considered one of the best albums to come out that year but Frank once again disappeared after releasing it choosing not to tour the album or take interviews he even neglected to submit it for consideration at the Grammys telling the New York Times in his only interview of that year that he felt the award system was dated the long and frustrating wait for Frank's next project is now under way he dropped a number of singles throughout 2017 and early 2018 most of them unrelated to each other or any sort of future release he hinted on tumblr late last year that his next project was complete but no news has come out since he also appeared uncredited on Travis Scott's Astroworld singing on the second track carousels Frank has proven himself to be one of the most gifted artists of our generation he continues to produce thoughtful introspective masterpieces that have quickly become considered some of the best ever made and so even if it takes another two years for him to resurface I won't mind the central point of Frank's creative spirit tells us exactly that he lives his life and we live our lives when he's come to a point where there's something more to say he says it and we listen and what else can we really ask for while we wait for Frank's next album learning today [Music]
