[Music] now the thing i remember saying at the beginning of this whole foldables wave is if we really want these foldables to catch on if this really is the future of how smartphones could be then the tech is going to have to get better and better to the point where folding in half is just another feature right there can't be huge compromises or massive price tags or awkward things about it it has to just be one more thing because at that point you know it's kind of cool that it folds but that's when early adopters are going to give it a shot and really see what it's about but if you want everyone to be trying these things it's got to be just one more feature it's got to be a normal phone in every other way except for the fact that it also folds in half that's when it gets interesting so with this phone the z flip 3 the ambition is still pretty simple give us a regular phone for regular use and then let us fold it shut into a sort of smaller form factor kind of like a throwback to the flip phones of yesteryear now there's a couple new features on this year's version that really make it that much more usable it doesn't change a ton but there are a few key things that make a big difference so in my order of importance it would be the new refresh design which is pretty sweet the much improved build quality and the bigger much more usable outside cover screen so the new design is pretty sweet it reminds me of the classic panda pixel 2 which is one of my favorite phone designs ever but it also looks and feels more refined too they squared up those sides you know they've shifted obviously you can see to a two-tone look and there's some new colors this cream color has gotten a lot of love but there's also a pretty sweet green and yes it does come in matte black if you're under that or you can just grab an icon skin from the link in the description and make it look even more sick i'm just saying link below now there's a funny little quirk of using a phone that's this shape which is when you fold it it's basically a square and so you put it in your pocket and a lot of times you flip it by accident or maybe it's upside down or whatever it can be in your pocket in any number of different orientations and so when you pull it out of your pocket there's this brief moment where you have to figure out where you're at figure out what's right side up and so this dual tone front and also the little tiny indentation for the fingerprint reader power button on the side has been my way of just like quickly finding home and getting into using the phone and so i kind of it's got a little utility i like that and i really like that they found a lot of other subtle little things to improve about the build quality too the flat sides like i said really nice but also this hinge is even more sturdy and will hold almost any angle you want until it's nearly shut which is when the magnets take over and give this satisfying that clap when it slaps shut it's a nice hinge and it also now happens to be ipx8 water resistant so while you should absolutely still keep it away from sand or dust it can now survive a splash of water or falling into a puddle and be totally fine so that's dope also underrated the stereo speakers are much better and fuller and even if you block that small bottom speaker grille with your finger the earpiece speaker is also plenty loud too so no worries that was well done i only really have two minor complaints with the build of this phone one it gets very fingerprinty that's i guess a little bit unavoidable or you could just skin it but two uh the volume rocker is like way up top on the side of the phone even with big hands just the way you normally hold a phone it's pretty unreachable so it becomes a sort of a two-handed operation to go up there and change the volume i definitely wish they'd just put it on the other side of the phone but instead there's this cut out which i believe is for the 5g antennas so i guess i just wish they swapped those but i guess aside from the hinge the most important part on a phone like this would be the screen and so there's really only one ambition of a phone like this which is to unfold into a normal phone experience and so this what you get here is a pretty big display unfolded it's almost s21 ultra sized so it's a 6.7 inch 22x9 1080p bright oled display with a hole punch cut out and it's 120 hertz finally so this was my biggest ask from the last version it just doesn't seem right anymore to charge flagship money for a phone with a 60hz display apple i guess can somehow still pull it off because people still buy iphones all the time but this feels way better way more smooth love the high refresh rate experience now but a couple things about this screen so first of all the top of this the screen protector it's a 30 harder cover glass on the screen great feature but this top layer of the screen protector is like cut out around the selfie camera and it's pretty annoying like it kind of looks like one of those cheap pre-installed screen protectors and it really makes me want to remove it but samsung would really like you to not remove it so that's gotten pretty annoying although i'll probably eventually get annoyed and take it off but it's there but two uh the crease the crease is definitely still here in fact it hasn't changed all that much from the last flip it's right through the middle of the phone where your finger runs over it all the time when you're scrolling through normal things like social media or emails or whatever you're doing so it's visually there but it's also physically there since you feel it so much i feel like it's both annoying but also like no big deal at the same time maybe i'm a little i'm a person who's used a folding phone before so i'm a little more used to the crease than a normal person but it's true if you just look at the content on the screen you can definitely ignore it the keyboard is below it doesn't touch it so all that's fine but on the other hand it's definitely still noticeable even if you're just a little bit off axis it catches your eye sometimes you know if you're reading text it'll kind of droop it in the middle a little bit so i'll like scroll a bit extra to get the text away from the middle it's weird i hope they keep working on this because if they could get it to feel even more flat like a normal glass screen someday that would be way better but yeah i think that should be the next big improvement minimizing this crease and also trimming down the edges around the display because it's still a bit off on a thousand dollar phone to have to do that gesture from the side but have your finger hit a piece of plastic but flip three is all about that outside cover screen so uh flip two as you can tell by my shirt shop.adamkbhd.com uh had a very very very small outside cover screen it basically would just show you the time and if you had a notification right then moto razr came out and while most of the rest of this phone was pretty terrible it did have a massive outside screen that turned out to be very useful so now samsung's given us a larger cover screen on the flip 3. not as big as the razers but it's four times the area as the last one and it genuinely changes the way you use the phone so actually do some quick stuff on the outside screen now without opening the flip so by default it's just time date and battery plus a dot over on the side if you have any notifications but then you can change the visual on the screen if you want to a bunch of different things in the settings there's a whole page you can change different animations and different backgrounds and clock styles you can even match it to the watch face if you have a samsung galaxy watch so that's pretty smart but from there you can do a bunch of stuff so you can swipe over to your different widgets in whatever order you want music weather a timer if you want one some people might want their calendar here it's not unlimited widgets there's actually just a list of six you can choose from that samsung's put in here and you can choose to order but even just these six are pretty useful so if i'm playing a podcast or music which i do all the time the music icon shows up and then i can tap that to skip right to the music controls widget and then play or pause or fast forward or whatever from here also fun fact when the phone is closed like this the volume buttons on the outside reverse function so this up direction increases volume and down decreases but then it flips back when you open up the phone again very smart you know it would have been smarter though google assistant on the outside screen just like firing it up asking it a question uh that's not a thing available here it does use bixby voice to answer text messages which is whatever it's fine but then also even taking pictures on the outside screen is way better you could do it before but it was a tiny screen you didn't want to this one actually would so it's a decent sized viewfinder and it's the primary camera so they're kind of nice and you can swipe up or down to change lenses and swipe left or right to switch from photo or video mode one thing to note though is selfies from the main camera with the cover screen will be a one by one square aspect ratio and there's no way to change that just a heads up aside from that though you do get decent selfie image quality from the primary cameras which aren't quite flagship level but they're pretty good same as last year the primary and the ultra wide and that kind of checks out across the rest of the features of this phone like i love that the cameras are basically flush with this phone but aside from that on a thousand dollar phone they're fine nothing special the battery life again you know this is a 3 300 milliamp hour battery split between the top and the bottom and it's powering a huge 120 hertz display so it did better than expected but when it taps out after four hours of screen on time that's just fine nothing special call quality again fine heat dispersion only really warms up when wireless charging on the rare wireless charger that actually fits a phone this size but again it's fine and on a phone like this it might sound like i'm like disappointed i'm saying oh it's fine it's fine but really that's kind of an accomplishment on a phone that screen folds in half like that's kind of amazing we are looking to eventually get down to the point where there's no major compromises or major shortcomings and it delivers on the one promise of being able to fold your phone down into something that's theoretically a bit more pocketable for people with smaller pockets or for ladies with purses and things like that and it does it so it's not super flashy or head turning it's not even as ambitious as the fold three which is trying to give you a normal smartphone and a tablet in your pocket which is a lot but the fact that it gives you a normal smartphone experience and folds in half is very close to what i said at the beginning and what i've been saying since the beginning of this whole foldables thing which will get them to catch on this is a folding phone i can actually start recommending to people and the fact that we got this far is crucial for them to move forward but speaking of crucial shout out to crucial for sponsoring this video it's perfect okay so crucial a brand of micron has been really good and really experienced with ssds now when i say ssd might be picturing like one of these guys that just goes into your computer but crucial is one of the biggest memory manufacturers in the world so they've brought their expertise to making external solid-state drives and these guys are super useful so a single external ssd like this is going to give you incredible performance reliable quality and durability with zero moving parts and they're compatible with not just windows and mac os but chrome os the xbox the ps5 android and the ipad pro you know the one ios device that actually has a usb c port it's a pretty ideal universal solution to so many things i've talked a lot about devices in the past that have lower base storage just to get away with having a lower base price and so you know cloud storage has been a popular solution to this problem but when you think about that economically you want it to save money by going into lesser storage but then you spend money every single month to sort of rent that space in the cloud which seems crazy when you can just have four terabytes in your pocket like this so we use these in the studio here all the time for transferring video files and assets between computers but for you i mean it's whatever you want the tiny x6 offers up to four terabytes of storage at 800 megabytes per second read write or if you're like me and you just need the speed you can get the crucial x8 and that'll do a 1050 megabytes per second for up to two terabytes of storage so future proof yourself grab a crucial ssd i'll have the link below if you want to check out the x6 or the x8 and of course uh i have the x8 if you care that's the one i carry with me all the time in my backpack but that's pretty much it thanks for watching i'll catch you guys in the next one peace
