the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus only has 375 US dollars worth of materials in it but it launched at a retail price of 840 what and the iPhone 10 while actually a little cheaper to assemble at three hundred and seventy dollars retails to start at about a thousand what if you could buy a phone for much closer to its actual cost well it turns out you can welcome back to another installment of why the five pertinent friendly content are you guys buying this where today we've got one of the top-selling phones on Chinese e-tailer gearbest the 213 dollar you me digi s to not to be confused with the Samsung Galaxy s2 also today is this exciting opportunity [Music] the unis did G or me did G yeah let's go with them s to has hundreds of reviews awarding it four point seven eight out of five stars on average and you can order one of these puppies for just two hundred and twenty nap okay actually it depends what warehouse you order it from because gearbest is super weird but let's call it two hundred and thirteen dollars now based on the language of the bulk of the reviews the s2 has been a bigger hit in Russia Poland and Italy than it has in the fancy-ass US and day but that doesn't necessarily mean that you'll get ridiculed by your flagship fondling friends because the s2 doesn't look like a budget phone it has a six inch edge to edge display in the chic 18 by 9 aspect ratio and anodized aluminum chassis with a USB type-c port and it's got a dual lens for your camera right above the rear fingerprint reader and the internals aren't terrible either unlike some value smartphones it's got 64 gigs of storage and it's expandable via microSD in the dual SIM slot it has the same amount of RAM as the Google pixel - and it has nearly double the rated battery capacity of the iPhone 10 50 100 milliamp hours so in practice getting it to two days is a pretty easy feat now compare that to what budget phones were like just a few years ago the Samsung Galaxy s5 and the motorola moto e both launched in 2014 with a similar price differential to what we're looking at here except that the Moto e was 50% thicker than the galaxy s5 had half the RAM and didn't have a front camera at all so how then have companies like Umi digi which was only founded in 2012 managed to close the gap so much well there are three main reasons first the small brands avoid some of the expenses that eventually ricky'll down into the price of premier brand phones so they use off-the-shelf components instead of researching and developing their own cutting-edge tech they focus on online and guerilla style marketing instead of doing things like spending fifteen million dollars on a single Superbowl commercial they rely on established ecommerce platforms like gearbest and Amazon instead of trying to build out their own stores and they benefit from what's called the economies of agglomeration what that means is that since everything is made in and around Shenzhen China they have easy access to manufacturing talent and inexpensive labor without having to invest much in their own logistics the second way that Chinese companies keep the price down is by flat-out paying less for their components and now I'm not even necessarily talking about using older inferior technology I'm talking about using the exact same parts that could be in your Samsung or your Apple phone but for less money so how do they get a deal like that the answer is binning a big brand with a reputation to uphold will by the suppliers best parts they're a parts batches of thousands of units where maybe only 1% of them are likely to fail that manufacturer's quality checks but as for value brands like this one they'll buy batches with significantly higher failure rates and much lower price tags to match strategy number three for keeping the cost down is to just not make any profit on the device now Umi digi doesn't do this but Xiaomi famously sells their phones with zero profit margin in exchange for market share and brand recognition paying the bills ostensibly by selling accessories like head phones power banks luggage and really the slippers okay so does all of this mean then that soon there will be no reason whatsoever to buy a flagship from Google Apple or Samsung the answer is No no it doesn't because budget phones still have a lot of cut corners the s2 screen for example looks like it was just glued on to the front of a phone instead of being seamlessly integrated into the camp furred edges though in fairness once you put it into the included sandstone case that particular flaw melts away with that said there's no hiding the resolution the s2 has about the same number of pixels as the iPhone 6 from 2014 but they're spread over a larger area giving it about half the pixel density of the leading phones its size and this is noticeable when you're reading text and in particular in the way that Netflix seems to handle streaming content to this phone it looks noticeably worse than even other value devices and then there's the camera while it isn't a complete potato patch the dual lens business is basically a complete marketing gimmick because the bokeh mode doesn't do I mean it just doesn't work like at all it just kind of makes everything but the center of the frame blurry it's it's just stupid like look at this it's just it's just it's like rubbing Vaseline on every part of the lens that isn't the very center here nobody takes pictures like that I mean never mind not having a I assisted you know bokeh background removal there's no there's no I even there's no consideration of depth at all it's a total joke and then finally there's the support or lack thereof I was having issues with my pixel to excel and Google quickly effortlessly dealt with the RMA for me even offering advanced replacement I would be floored to hear a similar story about umi digi and as for software this thing is running Android marshmallow which launched in 2015 and it will probably run marshmallow forever but might not seem like a huge deal on the surface but Android didn't even have a built-in slight utility at that point and it's got Google now on tap instead of the assistant which you can't get unless you do this one weird trick that phone manufacturers hate so is it time for you to stop spending your life savings every time you need a new phone the you me two gs two is a mere stock if a little dated Android experience with almost no bloat and it's not even that slow so if you don't care much about the camera and some people don't I say it's time for us to take a long hard look in the mirror and ask ourselves do I really need the latest and greatest need is a strong word but the speakers are awful fast charging is a super nice thing to have and that oh man that Netflix experience I don't remember the last time I saw a movie look this bad and I like Marvel movies speaking of things I like I like slash Lynas we're gonna have that linked below so
