frankly I'm not even a hundred percent sure where to start with this one meet a data's spectryx dat ddr4 memory as they're calling it the world's first RGB ddr4 memory with hybrid liquid air cooling system using a combination of a liquid heatsink and an aluminum heatsink to deliver effective thermal cooling water-cooled memory welcome my friends to manufacturers say this this is water-cooled memory throughout this video liners will refer to the liquid as water this is inaccurate the liquid is in fact 3m Novak however Linus is having some well-deserved time off making a vocal correction impossible so here I am rock you like a hurricane Here I am rock you like a [Music] Origin PC offers beautiful custom to check out their latest offerings at the link in the video description well we're off to a good start the shutdown button doesn't work brilliant who needs to shut down their computer anyway what am I supposed to do now I could just shart all over this stuff based on pure principles of cooling theory because I actually don't need to plug them in in order to know that the water cooling on them is really not doing anything but I at least try to take manufacturers claims somewhat seriously I want to give them every opportunity to prove me wrong here so what I'm gonna do is devise and experiment one thing's for sure they look pretty cool other than that they have a red heat spreader on an RGB RAM module on a more positive note this is hours of fun look there's a little bubble oh this is interesting it makes no meaningful thermal contact outside of it looks like this part of the spreader might go under there with the actual memory chips let's start I guess with the standard stuff then or no let's make sure this stuff even boots up first show me the post all right now that we're booted up let's go ahead and press start on a stress system memory test hopefully our FLIR camera will tell us some interesting things about what's going on here we can see the heat is clearly concentrated directly over the actual DRAM modules the second thing that we can see is that my suspicion that there was some kind of contact between this medallion here and the water cooling at the top was probably not correct it looks like the only places where heat is being transferred up into the top chamber are kind of over here and I'm not sure why and then kind of over here so those are almost the same temperature as the spot directly over the chimps say you can say if we look directly over top of it the water cooling portion is still quite cool okay so after a few minutes of testing our thermals have stabilized anywhere from around 47 to 50 degrees depending on where exactly we're looking on the spreader here but that's not that interesting we were expecting that what we did figure out that is interesting is why we're seeing those little centers of activity of thermal movement up here that actually came from perusing a data is very optimistic by the way diagram of how these modules work so heat gets generated by these drm packages right here with you so far then it gets I don't know it goes through these holes I'm not sure what they're talking about but there's that there's a heat spreader here that then somehow theoretically heat up or something anyway the point is once the assembly is put together there's an actual heat spreader portion here and here that's causing those hot zones on these sides the reason this one doesn't work is because on a standard ddr4 memory module there is no chip in the middle so there's no heat for this to carry away this is more efficient than this chunk of metal so we're gonna go ahead and throw my regular test bench memory back in here and we'll compare against that so we still need a few more minutes with our other memory modules here it looks like we're gonna end up somewhere in the 40 to 40 something mid range so it took a little longer thanks to the additional thermal mass of these Triton Z modules but we are back up to anywhere between about 50 degrees and 47 degrees just like last time so the rules of the game have not in fact changed Ram doesn't really need cooling unless you're you know extreme overclocking it to break records and heat spreaders don't really do a whole lot for it regardless of the design of them so what conclusion can we draw about this thing then I guess the best way I could describe it would be this the water on the top of these RAM modules it's not hurting anything it's like homeopathic pills where they just contain basically nothing but it's not helping anything and as much as we love our friends over at a data to say that it is water-cooled it's a boat like it would be for me to say that this CPU with a bubble of water on the middle of it is water cooled water does not inherently cool anything you have to have surface area that's why water cooling still needs radiators that's why heat sinks need fins and not just heat pipes well that whole thing wasn't lightning isn't learning fun you get 20% off at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys if you disliked this video then you know I'm sorry to hear that it's a sad time for all of us but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featured at the link in the video description I mean to be very clear you guys it's not like it's bad memory you could still buy it if you're into just like RGB memory with a pool bar on the top also linked in the description is our merch storm test cool shirts like this one and our
