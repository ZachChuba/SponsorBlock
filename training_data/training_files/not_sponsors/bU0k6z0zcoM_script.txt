every choice that we make has weight behind it some are light and some are heavy in rust you'll be put into situations that are in the realm of fantasy a simulation of a post-apocalyptic world where there are no rules a world unlike ours where you can do anything because of this the decisions that we make gravitate more towards extremists honey popper murderer but if you were given a choice to kill one friend to save the other what would you do I can't I talk to every single one of you I can't kill any of you [Music] before we even met up and made a team together there is already a battle between ak's around us this was a perfect opportunity for us since we try to get a gun first before we even make a base I found myself crossbow and was ready to make the play [Music] all this nothing here but turns out I wasn't the hero this time the rng gods were the heroes just go straight to the bodies he's gonna bolt it right now I was picked up and sometimes good old Gary blesses you with holy powers and you get guns without even killing anyone [Music] [Music] not even half an hour in and we were geared to the maximum it was time to build a base however while we figure out thanks again to Reed shadow legends for sponsoring this video how can I remove parts of my barrels when I destroy them Oh max Gibbs zero and your settings [Applause] fortunately we match to find a decayed base with a tier 2 workbench that we can take over while trying to figure out how you can make this abandoned home truly my own there were countless rockets and m249 shots not too far away and obviously as curious as we are we had to go investigate left ready ready one more one more on the right I think when you only have one set of gear set on you you kind of need to play conservative to multiplayer guns kind of like how you let your dough rise before baking the bread we kept messing with the Raiders one by one and they finally had enough and came to greet us at our doorstep [Music] yo there's [ __ ] H agreeing us from all the whip there what behind hey bring it back bring back i headshot him he's a chicken aiding us or smoke it smokes Oh [Music] mini copter let him he's not dead [Music] another one that's you oh I missed that shot he has rocket launcher by the way ratchet has rocket launcher e they're gonna read us right now we went from having one gear set each is having boxes full of guns and gear by killing these guys over and over we have a few months become one the rate target was now us that's how the head shot them to headshot them - he has no [ __ ] walls dude this get this car it's killing me isn't to know we're back [ __ ] that guy hit all night I tell them that's a bit that's got a mess of them you know you might be dead hit him hit him yeah I'm gonna go for it [ __ ] like maybe like I'll get up y'all I had something but I'm dead too I think there's another LR on the right side [Music] [Music] they're pushing to the rocket launcher three four outside a base on a rocking good lunch is one [Music] go buy some he said yes yes let's do it I'm dead tired all three dead all do that you're at so the rest is pushing all [ __ ] rest is dead let's go okay or neighbor just grab like ten a kiss and there's like four or five guys outside the rapist right now oh okay these guys we now use their own rockets to destroy their rapists like a big brother smacking you with your hands and saying why are you hitting yourself why are you hitting yourself in this case it's because they failed and lost their rockets yes yes heavy armor in there I killed him though I don't though there's another turn on the right side so we have to reach him to the left okay no no you should wait you should wait keep you pure rocket just stagger it so that you can be pure oxygen and then just double rocket okay after that just wait for him to reload what's up with roads nothing oh this guy's so much components Mikey got here they're rocking fire fire doors I thought off right now [Music] we use all the rockets and ultimately died at the end since we couldn't go any further into the base because of a turret we just killed them a few more times outside and recycle that outpost it was a EU server and I was getting pretty late over there a lot of my friends were logging off so we wrote together for the last time before I'm left solo I should be done soon all right oh yeah he's gonna like [ __ ] me up oh the horse I think I think we're good I never had this happen before so I don't know if it's gonna do something we I'm actually stuck I'm actually stuck you I'm actually
