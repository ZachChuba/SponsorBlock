the state of Android tablets is deplorable barely anyone that matters even still bothers to make them and they're so far behind Apple's iPad in basically every way that matters that I wouldn't blame people for not even knowing that they exist and a consequence of that is that for the ones that do exist you basically want to spend as little as possible on them while still getting good enough performance for the things you want to do because remember low price does not always equal good value so if you're in the market then for an inexpensive device that you can like use to watch movies in bed or look at recipes in your kitchen or into a kid to run off with yes around I mean I'm not giving them my note 9 that's for sure so today we're gonna be taking a look at Walmart's 10-inch entrant into the budget Android tablet market and determining is it even worth $80 or should you just pony up double for the reigning incumbent best selling cheap Android tablets the Amazon Fire HD 10 that's fine that's just the invite code take tastic at the link below to get some great bonuses [Music] so I think the first thing that I want to know is what exactly is it about this that makes it a Walmart tablet this just looks like they took whatever Chinese tablet they could find and then they put this sticker on it that entitles you to $20 of e-books from Walmart ebooks oh I think they did slightly more than that because this is actually Walmart's in store brand oh it's the same brand of the tv-tv yes okay but different than the laptops and desktops that's the overpowered brand okay so then Walmart just either doesn't employ very good graphic designers or they went out of their way to make this look I think so is that an expectation management strategy for sure like you want a box that attracts the type of customer that this appeals to if the box is super premium looking I might not even look at the features of the price because I expect it's out of my price range got it okay so it's 10.1 inches it's got a 1.3 gigahertz processor 2 gigs of RAM 16 gigs of storage and a claimed battery life of five and a half hours now that's not a huge battery life claim no it's really not but if that's screen on time it's also not entirely unreasonable well this one here by contrast claims 10 hours which is double that but this is kind of better in almost every way except for the RAM which is the same it has more memory starting at 32 and an option to go to 64 this is really not a very impressive display even just aside from text being kind of blurry like when I have a web browser open you can see here even just basic app icons have kind of a fuzziness to them and that's because it's only running at 1280 by 800 resolution worse than that though is that there's a really really big air gap like it's been a while since I've seen one this big between the panel behind and the glass on top so it kind of feels like your finger is floating above the icons you trying to hit as opposed to actually touching them now with that said the actual responsiveness of it is far from the worst I've seen this is running Android actually a pretty pure Android 9 while this has Amazon Oh ass on it that's a smoother animation for sure though so that's a bit of a double-edged sword because you've got all the Amazon junk pre-loaded and you have to sideload your Android apps that's right there's no Google Play Store in here but this one's not perfect because you can see there's an extra button here besides your multitask and home and back button what's that button look like a Walmart Walmart logo what happens oh thank goodness I have a dedicated button to shop at Walmart or more grocery Sam's Club open up Vudu and Walmart's ebooks of course which I get $20 of credit for thank you okay so this is me trying to put the volume down and it's going up and I would think that the left side is intuitively down yeah but if I let's check that out if I rotate it down down down is up and down wait wait I get it now that the volume button it's not designed to be used like this it's designed to be used like this so there's your volume up and there's your volume down it's right there at your thumb so your palm could just accidentally turn it off I'm not saying I support this we're gonna make you saying that's what it is oh that is not HD that sounds awful oh my god that doesn't even look like like HD yeah like I'm talking 720 HD okay let's compare the sound though that's a lot better easily twice as good give me that one again not as loud nope and it fuel it sounds vibrating Anthony Hopkins does not sound like that yeah no it's day and night yeah Dan Nate so that's a clear victory for Amazon what's our next step then well we can do a gaming evaluation but here's where it gets a little tricky this one uses the Amazon Appstore the only one that was on here was passmark okay so I got past mark in there and we can run the benchmark side-by-side so I went and did some tours for a bit and you're done I've been done for a while and by you're done I mean um some of these tests don't seem that bad like the 1.1 gigabytes per second of storage speed wait oh no that was memory oh oh oh 31 megabytes a second you might as well be running off an SD card it's literally 1/10 the storage speed like never mind half and that makes a big difference on a device like this but what about the camera oh let's see who can take the greatest picture of this tabletop gaming stuff here oh my goodness maybe it'll be better once it actually gets to process it so here's my processed image it's really not any better than if you find whoa so I'd say there's some over sharpening and this is a little bit too saturated but it's definitely better okay so it sucks but the question at the top of this video was is it good enough like if you can pay less is this one good enough to get done what you want to get done I would say for the discerning customer no I would either pay the extra for this one or I would just step down to a smaller Amazon tablet knowing that I'm at least gonna get a reasonably color calibrated screen if it ran Netflix without compression artifacts all over the freaking place I'd say yeah at half the price I'll just save the money because the build quality of it well not exceptional by any stretch is it's not gonna fall apart it's it's it's robust enough that you could toss it onto the couch with confidence it's just not good enough that I could recommend it as anything other than a secondary tablet for the kids and I would personally take the compromise of a smaller sharper screen over a larger one that just isn't good enough it was funny because when we did the Amazon video were like yeah this thing's not great but apparently it's not the worst whoa good job Jeff that linked below so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out the link to where to buy the stuff we featured in the video description to be clear it's like a kid's tablet sure why not I wouldn't spend any more than I absolutely have to on something like that and it does feel pretty robust also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like that one and our community forum which you should totally join seriously though guys this one is finally actually in stock and they are selling like hotcakes actually don't know if I told you this these are moving like crazy yeah are you sure they're nuts they're not selling like Bob's your uncle I actually did know that I did that on purpose and Bob's your uncle the videos over
