1! 2! i~ We are (G)I-DLE~~~~~!!! Welcome to IDOL GROUND~! Neverland! Make some noise~~~! Thank you so much~~~~!! Last time! YuQi, ShuHua and SooJin appeared on our show. Did you see their video? Yes, we did!! There were so many videos.....(lol) There were so many! Only then Yu Qi passed the self-introduction game. (Surprised) Amazing......!!!! She is perfect. The three of them said this in unison at the time. "MIYEON and MINNIE will surely fail." (Why???) (Upset) "I'm not sure about So Yeon." (You guys did that....?) (Evidence) MIYEON can never do it! So is MINNIE! SOYEON is likely to succeed. We are better than them! We'll be able to do well. We can do this~~! There is a 60-second time limit for games.  The chance to play games is three times. You must succeed within 60 seconds of the time limit. If words and movements are wrong, the game will fail. If you succeed in the game, you will be given time to promote it. We got it~~!!!! (I don't understand.........) The only record holder for G-IDLE is YUQI. I'm a Queen~!!!! Her lap time is 49 seconds. Wow~ She is smart........ Are you ready to beat her record? Well~ (I trust!) We have SOYEON!! (What???) I'm not good at games.... You'll draw lots before you start the game. Drawing lots! Open the paper~ No.1 SOYEON! No.2 MINNIE! No.3 MIYEON! Say a word before you start the game. (....................) I'll beat YUQI~~~~~~~~~ We'll beat YUQI~!!!!!!!!!!!! Let's start the game now. The first challenger, God-So Jeun Leader! You are already receiving so much anticipation. A main rapper and genius composer! Do your best not to damage your reputation. Have you ever seen me play LOL? I'm not good at games.... (She died heroically in battle....) I'm not good at games.... I have no talent in games at all. (Why aren't you so confident...?) NONONONO Don't expect anything from me!!! I don't have any expectations for me, but I don't know why people expect me. That's weird.... Cheer up! Cheer up! Shall we? G-IDLE's leader! Main rapper! So Yeon's first try! (Don't count on it!) (What's this beat....????) (Wake up!)

Fail~ Oh my god......... You did well for the first time. Really? When you play games, you tend to get impatient. But success is more important than speed in this game. Actually, I was hasty.... (Confession) Actually, I was hasty! Going up to the fourth level, my eyes suddenly became blurred. (She can't lie) Do you want to practice? To practice? (Practice) My shoulder is broken. (Her movements are strange...) (Practice again) LEGO! Do you understand now? Yes. OK~ Let's start! I'm not confident. The second try!

(Laugh) SoooooooooJin You should have chosen between the two of us!!!!!! You have no sense!!!!!!!! Anyway, Success~~~~!!! Congratulations~ Did you succeed in your second attempt? Yes. Expected record? 55 seconds? MIYEON : 57, MINNIE : 53 The answer is.......... 52 seconds~! (Happy) (Wait) I lost to YUQI. I'll do it again!!!! Really? One more time~!!!! If you try again, the previous record will be reset. Then I'll give up! (She is quick to give up) There is no reset in my dictionary! How many tries did YUQI succeed? It was probably the second attempt, too. I can't do this anymore....(???) Do you want to give up the re-challenge? Yes.... You picked SooJin as your favorite member. So they were disappointed. Well.... Actually.......... Really...... Honestly.....!!! If I hadn't thought about it, I could have cut three seconds. 'My favorite member??' (She chose SooJin after agonizing between MINNIE and MIYEON) (It's a cowardly excuse!!!!!!!!!) I've prepared a special gift for those who succeed in the game. (Very happy) What is it? OMG!!!! Real gift??!!! (Intense excitement) (She has the biggest reaction since the opening) I..... really....... I like this kind of wrapping paper. It's like a Christmas present~ Please cheer for the other two members.
(Soulless) Cheer up~ (...........) She threw a challenge at YUQI! But the game is difficult.... To be continue~
