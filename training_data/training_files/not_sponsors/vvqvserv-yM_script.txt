Hey it's fourth of July time trying to break out the grill get it hot while we're gonna put on it who I'm talkin about a foot long of goodness and cheesy with a special sauce come on I'll get two coals hot and we'll throw it on there together [Music] hey thank y'all so much for stopping by that backyard it is a glorious evening it is but folks something mentally and heavy on my mind it has heavy I done told y'all a lie the title of this video was what the ultimate footlong when I'm lying to you it is a it and a half long I'm talking a foot and a half long of meat cheese bread special sauce smoked and goodness I'm thinking all of it is good and folks let's think about it a little now put your hand to your chin right here and let's study and commiserate on the life of the hot dog yes it is shortly have the good answer Shan it is but folks do you know over the fourth of July period that there is over a hundred and fifty million hotdogs consumed in the USA that's which stretch from the west coast to the east coast and yes I am right Shan this is West and that is East cause the sun's right over Jana five times lining them hot dogs up in to end folks that's a lot of hot dogs so let's give him a break ok let's let's go with something else now you can use a hot dog for this but I would advise against it we're talking about smoking some good old hot links I mean that are really good and tasty and some kielbasa sausage it is gonna be so good with that special sauce on it so stick around folks you don't want to miss this one now folks if you've seen the poor boy sandwich video and who wasn't it good I do love them crispy shrimp I do you want you ain't seen it well you need to go back and search it because I guarantee you some fine dining it is but to Ariat people who dress me up looking sharp with shirts and boots they were kind enough to give us some boots to give away all you had to do was enter and guess what we're gonna announce the winner right now we are who is it [Music] congratulations to you and I hope them boots make your feet happy and you do too happy dance all day long but I want to thank Ariat too because they always do such a great job and guess what they be having some sales still going on you just need to check it out there will be a link down there where you can see what I'm wearing you can dress like me everything is great above the grass I've got me some hot links here and some cobalt sir skinless because when you cook that stuff just right a lot of times that skin get a little tough and a little too crispy but we got that grill cleaned heated really going well threw me up a blonde on there and smoked it blistered it off so easy to peel it will cuz we're gonna need it later so we got it set right over their side but folks I need you to just take these and cut them straight in half they're gonna lay on the grill better and we're gonna need them that way for our ultimate foot-and-a-half loan so let me get them sliced up here you can see quality control is under the table making sure that things are going to his specifications that means he wishes his dad was clumsy but drop something on the girl well folks I have got me some hardwood lump oak in there got it going just right I did then you see me throw some mesquite in there and a little bit of Hickory because when we slice them in half I want to get more penetration smoke in there and I've got all the coals right to one in we're gonna start out over here on the indirect side let this get some good color let it heat up well get something that smoke in there and then we'll turn them over well we've got our meat laid back on there remember that poblano that we blistered now folks even though we got it skinned and got it blistered I like to put it back over here on this indirect side to let that smoke get to it even give it more flavor than when it's got so let me fetch it so look at that it has shook them close it was wearing and it is ready to go over here and participate with the rest of the people so I'm just gonna lay them right here beside this all the fires on that in we're gonna choke her down just a tad since we got us a flame in there leave it a little in this and here a little bitty one is open I got one little bitty and open on that side we're gonna let that smoke come around it and love on it and we're probably gonna let it go about 15 to 20 minutes and then we're gonna turn it over let it smoke a little then we'll put it down here on the hot side of the fire what's going on here excuse me what is going on there is no meat up here huh oh you're just making sure all right then we're gonna get us some good color and some Christmas on that hot link and that smoked sausage then we're gonna bring out the ultimate foot and a half long piece of bread well about ten minutes in folks I flipped them to the other side and you can see so let's move them down here to the hot end of this rice cool turn them over flesh side down cuz I just want to get a little Christmas there and it won't take long the poblano has served his purpose needs to come over here and rest about five minutes right here and they'll have enough crisps to them that we can slide them back over and let them sit and we'll go to working on that bread well time to check in that's been about five and you can see looky there that's what America a little Charl Charl a little char and a little Christmas you could put these down here on the other end but folks I'm gonna need that room in a minute so I'm gonna put them in this Dutch oven that I got sitting right here handy and let it keep on warm that way I won't have to worry about nobody getting no brown and it already is and it'll just sit there and mind its own business so I see you eyeballing it big I do well cut them in there just resting minding their own business we do stick of that one carry gold butter yeah Shan has converted me that's all I put on anything anymore so - that one stick of melted carry gold butter I want you to add some smoked paprika and some garlic powder I'm gonna do a little artisan work today so make sure you got your paintbrush and get it stirred up oiled we're gonna let it sit there and mind its own business and let some of them flavors just to incorporate our good little poblano here that did all the work over by itself I just want you to go ahead and just core that thing out of there take your knife just rake them seeds over to one side go ahead and split it all the way down make sure you get all them seeds out and then I just want you to take it and just cut it in strips because folks we got to have this poblano in there it's gonna bring so much more flavor just stacking over here sort of out of the way for a minute and let's talk about this breather it is not a footlong Jim it is eighteen point two inches long and folks we need it all for the amount of meat that we have there so bread knife with your knife skills try to just go right down dead center big will you take care of that trash for me that just blew off everybody and then just gently open it up gently layer right out there like that I need you to take the butter stir it up really well and if you find that your butter has got a little cooler and coagulate it a little either stick it back in the microwave or over the fire and I just want you to put some all over i'm generously co-teach in most generously because folks we need this for the flavor but we got to have it for a little toasting action well we got our buttered our bread we have as you see so let's go to the grill I'm gonna lay right there folks and at this time Brad really wants to stick to something that's hot so give it one more greasing all the way around we got our fire crank down pretty low to the bottom there because I don't want to burn this I just wanted to get good and hot we can even leave it open you can but I'm not because I want to trap some of that smoky goodness even in that bread so we're gonna let it toast there just a minute provolone be the first one just layer out there I like to slice this a little in advance that way you can sort of get it on there before everything goes to running crazy on you next come the cheddar lame on there anyway you want to just make sure that everybody's got some of it only big since you're the only one out here working can you catch that well you got close you give up your baseball career just to go into cooking didn't you so here we go back up here back on the fire guess what it needs a little butter it does give it a little bit of that flavor let that garlic in that smoke pepper we can get in there roll it over and don't burn your fingers and it don't take long for this process to happen well you see me we don't whipped up some special sauce we did folks mayonnaise mustard a little bit of that ketchup get your onion blend it all in there together set it up in that ice box and just let it get all them flavors blend it well because we got to have it what hotdogs got mustard mayonnaise and ketchup on them and onions so hey this is gonna be a great deal so we're gonna need this safe to put on that other side so join me over here and let's get her layer down there [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well folks I'm going to tell you right now before you go any further have one of these apparatuses with you because you're gonna need it for all the goodness that is in this sandwich and cheese cheese layer other sauce hotlinked smoked sausage toasted bun you don't get no better than this so I think I'm gonna have a bite well folks there's a lot of goodness right there the years and that sauce time you let it sit in there and marry all together with them onions and all that flavor mmm it is good star the show the crunch of the brilliant the cheese and to me the hot link and the poblano there's a lot of stars win Academy Awards they will on this deal because it isn't that good and you can slice this any way you want it's going to come out to feed a bunch of people so really it's cheaper than going to the store and buying a hundred and fifty thousand hot dogs and buns when you can publish feed eight or nine people out of this deal and you know that hot dog eating contest to heaven eat all them hot dogs in so many minutes I'd like to see how many of these they could eat in 15 minutes no I mean I would like to see it but folks this is very easy to do just takes a little time ooh and it is so tasty and you can share it with your friends and neighbors well like I said invite your neighbors over this is coming out maybe for the fourth of July you can grill it all up hey it is a great time to be together in the backyard maybe your cooking at the lake this is an easy recipe you just need a little help to assemble it all and get it to go and come come out easier now folks we're talking about 4th of July Independence Day now to me I am a very patriotic person I am and that flag that me and Shannon are always talking to y'all about that our veterans and all our servicemen and women have fought for died
