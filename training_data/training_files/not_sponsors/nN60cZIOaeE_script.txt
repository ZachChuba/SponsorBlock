hello guys so in this game we decided to try and get into the secret vaults on warzone we got insanely lucky multiple times this round and had one of the best combat games of all time I hope you guys enjoy want to kill me thank you one more me in the building I'm literally at the back of the mat at the back can't see him breathing thing there's a truck now being beamed from the other house someone raised inside down another one came it was a USD he just run in but now we have to contract through this life oh my god Wesley rut right I'm going hide somewhere don't hide in that building do we actually got the keycard no way okay I think I'm in the kilo but I'm um I don't know okay yeah coming why do we need to rest Tom over before we use the keycard well yes I guess we should but we need to get more money we've not got long sorry those needs right here is that Korean here's our no dude this game sucks why have they done this I'm guessing again for the cleanser which is super risky yeah we're gonna have to part this player spot yeah tents I mean unless we can kill one and then just run away no cuz there because it's too risky dude okay well do we just go I think we'll have to go some way with the keycard yes I find it in fire station but I'm pretty sure that's what even leered the thing is oh we should have just done this earlier only putting the thing then go and rest on money we're dumb well now we can did not open yeah do we have the wrong key card Oh what kicad have you got say when you scroll over it it doesn't do sector B oh yeah if it's the for the door on the inside no so you need to key to know cuz that's to ever no one's got past our second gate yet I thought you just you find a key card and you go to any bunker but I guess it said read access key card super unique it's at the base of Donna Barney you can use red key card okay I guess we got a vehicle how much do we go then we got 43 seconds there's a truck there yeah that's too far deep I didn't realize it was one down there man where it's almost marked right there I'm just been told us at the base of Dominic we've got 28 seconds but where we gonna do dying again doesn't exist with this
