after dozens of Republican attack ads Barack Obama finally fired back this week with a series of constructive criticism ads that gently point out in consistencies in McCain's policies let's take a look Barack Obama thinks John McCain is a true American and would make an excellent president but it seems like some voters might be confused by his health care plan Barack Obama is sure it is a good plan but maybe could be expressed more clearly than it is now maybe Senator McCain could give a couple of specifics then again Senator McCain could probably continue doing what he's doing now and would surely win a lot of votes anyway I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message joining us now from the war for the white house election analysis bunker is Jack Bergin Jack good to see you you too Andria Jack Obama has clearly decided to take the gloves off and go get is right he's telling Republicans you punched me in the face I'm not just gonna stand there I'll wince raise up my hand and ask you politely to stop were you surprised by this move Jack actually Andria we've seen Obama using consistently more forceful language over these past few months if I read July where he called McCain a real character is really baring his teeth yes and that's the point he was trying to make with this next ad as well John McCain would further embroil American troops in Iraq Barack Obama feels this is wrong for America but that's not to say Barack Obama is perfect or anything if McCain wanted he could point out that Obama voted to subsidize coal interests despite his rhetoric against global warming not that McCain has to do that Barack Obama is just saying I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message those are some scathingly helpful suggestions in that that is right Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe said Obama wanted to hit McCain hard but not in a way that would hurt McCain's feelings or make him think that Obama doesn't like him as a person exact now is Obama going to bring up any of these points of contention in his next debate with McCain no he'd be too nervous to say them out loud to McCain space we have heard Obama has been having some second thoughts about yeah according to campaign insiders Obama was up all night with a stomachache wearing the ads would make McCain quote hated those concerns over the previous two ads caused him to create this apology and it started running in key battleground states tonight let's take a look at Barak Oh is sorry if he made John McCain mad before he's just running too sad to say no matter what happens Obama hopes they can stay friends because presidential races come and go but friends are what matter in the end I'm Barack Obama and I approved this message well that was very nice of Obama now tell me jack how is McCain reacted to the ads he's planning to release an ad calling Obama a gay loving elitist Muslim and then a second one targeted at his children I understand Obama attempted to get several of his friends to run harsher attack ads for him by they wouldn't do what's right he also tried to get his wife to run one all right well thanks for joining us jack
