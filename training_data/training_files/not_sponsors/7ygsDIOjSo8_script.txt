last year we had three guest videos on the channel different youtubers learning new skills whilst offering a different approach to land quake and the audience seemed to enjoy that this forma as a way of putting deserving channels in the limelight whilst I work on a bigger our talented youtuber is funded filling in for me this week is Sophie from Sophie's notes an educational channel discussing science from dessert stomachs to why we are tempted to look at spoilers to love Island so go watch the gasps video and if you like it show your support and go and subscribe to soft stones links are down below hello everyone I'm full marks right way for noticing that I am NOT mic my name is Sophie and I normally make videos about science for my channel soaps notes but I met Mike a few months ago and he asked me if I'd like to learn something for his channel here and obviously here I am I said yes now when it came to choosing what to learn I had two key criteria one was that I moved to London relatively recently so I wanted to learn something that would make me kind of fit in here and two I wanted to learn something that Mike definitely would never be able to do therefore I'm going to learn how to do a taxi whistle like one of those kind of things with your fingers in your mouth obviously so hopefully I'll look really great when I'm hailing a cab in the capital of the UK I never could do that seesee and also I know Mike can't do it because when I mentioned it to him he confirmed it's physically impossible because and I quote my tongue is weirdly small which I'm sure you really wanted to know so here is my journey to learning how to do a taxi whistle this is day one hour zero the reason why I couldn't do this is because his tone was too small and that's because to do a taxi whistle I think it got like fold your tongues back over itself so my tongue is actually with long from fact I so hopefully should be alright I'll be able whistle there's been whistle noise though oh my god well mitten there is a really nice way she's great okay so I feel like my my teeth are really getting in the way I'm gonna I'm gonna try and cover them up alright oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah [Music] immediately made more a whistle noise okay [Music] okay so there is a version the way you can do like this but I I kind of prefer this version I want to learn this way because I want to just be able to be doing other things with this hand you know holding cups or typing on phones and then this can be the whistle the whistle hand so yeah but I think there's no not fun not make sure that dizzy actually I'm a bit I gonna have a snack I'm getting a bit dizzy I got a lot of time to warm up this morning the lips the teeth the tip of the tongue the lips the teeth this before telling my lips the teeth the tip [Music] sounds a whistle that's different kind that's like going up and through okay these just consistency now living this is my issue [Music] [Music] maybe if I play the part it will come out it's more let's come out like Oh taxi day three so I'm realizing that a key part of this challenge is consistency because I've had a couple of times when I've done I'd say I've done the whistle like I've done quite a loud whistle but then I've tried again I've not been able to do it so I feel like before I can say I've officially completed this challenge I need to be able to do the whistle three times in a row and ideally I need to be able to do it removing my hand my mouth and putting it back in because it's you know that the big challenge is kind of losing the exact perfect position so three times in a row hun removal I'm feeling good I think I can do it [Music] okay maybe not like good [Music] [Music] don't buy is it that you see advisor that is you did not even see not anything oh my god is the thing I can do it I can efficiently taxi we saw oh my god I can't believe oh my god okay I'm gonna go I'm gonna have some lunch I'm gonna come back you see like I still do it after lunch now now that my initial excitement has subsided I do realize that I've not yet shown I can do though dude look like official taxi whistle intonation but turns out that once you've learnt hunts you the whistle the intonation is kind of like an easy extra it just means you just do a little whistle breathe in and then do the whistle again it's just about practising that style so it's a bit like this also just a word on technique so I'm quite in the rhythm of it now and what I do is I put my mouth like this and make little gap so I cover my teeth my lips and then I get my fingers ready and I just slide in with the mouth tight around my fingers so that it's a real tight seal and then as I slide in I then use that sliding motion to push my tongue back and then do the whistle so it also helps if both your mouth and your fingers like a little bit moist so I think that's enough now I'm not sure how well the volume actually comes across on the video but I'm gonna meet up with Mike very soon and so hopefully he'll be able to vouch for me with is do you think I can do it with this it's like your whole time I don't know how I eat food there's something wrong about your face everyone uses uber in London oh so it's completely useless go black ops they're my dreams I want to curiosity stream comm /language to get started thank you very much for watching and
