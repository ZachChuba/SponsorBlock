this monstrosity right here is my personal gaming rig and it's actually served me really well for the last three years at the time the specs were pretty blazed and fast it had an Extreme Edition eight core processor calling eight cores extreme these days seems kind of quaint and a Titan X graphics card but because it uses in videos old Maxwell architecture this Titan graphics card not only is much slower than modern gaming cards actually lacks a bunch of really cool features like their updated video encoder as well as you know RTX real time ray tracing so today's video is all about upgrading it but here's the thing I don't have time to spend literally a year designing a custom paint job for the front okay I didn't design that but admittedly I do think it looks cool and a completely custom enclosure for full loop water cooling in a rack mount chassis that ain't happening so today's gonna be all about well if I'm being honest playing a no eighteen hundred because I got that game it ran like garbage on my 34 40 by 1440 monitor and so I reached out to a orison Nvidia who put together this little care package that's going to take us from very very last gen to pretty much the fastest it gets IBM is giving away 1500 years of age so check it out at the link below [Music] so I guess we'll start with a little classic unboxing of what has to be one of the coolest motherboard products to come down the pipe in in my opinion at least to the last year or so this is the gigabyte z3 9da horas extreme what they call it water force 5g and what's special about it is that this is like an $1,100 motherboard or something crazy like that but it's also not as insane as it might sound because unlike most motherboards this one actually includes a prebend and pre overclocked CPU so check this out the board actually comes with the CPU pre-installed so it's a core I 999 hundred K that's been validated for 5.1 gigahertz it's got all the usual features you'd expect a handful of m2s SLI support three PCIe 16x slots oh this could throw a bit of a monkey wrench in the pudding we've got a side mounted 24 pin hopefully that fits my case is a little unconventional but right what's more interesting than all the features it has is what it doesn't have check that out bear chipset check that out we've got bear VRMs there's no cooling on this board what kind of crazy person would buy $1,000 motherboard with absolutely no cooling on it whatsoever so it turns out what I was looking for was actually in a clearly labeled separate box this is the ARS all-in-one monoblock so oh a monoblock is basically a single block that is designed to cool multiple different components so this one right here is designed to cool check this out the CPU the vrm components all three of your MDOT two drives and the chipset it weighs probably like oh my goodness like a kilo or two and it looks like it includes not one but two RGB lighting leads here's one and here's what appears to be another one although I'm not a hundred percent sure if that's right here we've got a bracket and a rubber because when you got this much sex appeal you never know what might accidentally happened am i right my friends and then we've got a bunch of a bunch of supplies for screwing so our first order of business then is mounting the monoblock to the motherboard okay and now we start to put in screws one pro tip for installing any kind of block whether it's an individual CPU block or some kind of a mono block whether it's graphics or full motherboard is you never want to go in too tight so I'm just putting these in a little bit to make sure they're not cross threaded I am basically not tightening them at all just holding them in place I've determined that the washers are for these screws not by reading the manual of course but by just noticing that they are either plastic or they're coated and otherwise these screws would be going into a bare PCB which could cause a short because they're just normal metal screws so these washers then are serving two purposes one is to make sure that it doesn't short out the second purpose of these washers is to ensure that the screws don't accidentally loosen over time you might not realize this but the inside of a computer can have a lot of vibrations whether it's from fans or spinning disks and unless you've got Loctite and/or washers on anything that you've mounted it is possible for them to vibrate loose over time Wow so as much as it kills me to bid adieu to my limited edition gold-plated CPU block this is pretty spiffy looking so now I've got to take apart my old rig alright so the first thing we're gonna do is pop out both the GPU and CPU it's one of the things I love about soft tubing is that it is super quick Julie to get your entire loop removed for system maintenance there we go so that gives me completely unfettered access to my motherboard area here's my Intel NIC these days every motherboard that's worth its salt chips with a better network card than this so I'll be I'll be leaving this behind you know it's funny I would say one of the most notable things about this machine is how not out-of-date certain components are I mean Corsair only replaced the ax 1500 I think like six months ago and even then the 1600 I yeah it's it's better but it's not like you know a quantum leap forward and power supply performance or anything like that and I actually will still get to reuse my Dominator ddr4 in here so this is a 64 gig kit of Cass 15 memory yeah it only runs at 2666 designed for Gen 6 I 5s and i7 but hey if it fits ice it's right I mean to be clear I'm not expecting XMP profiles to work or anything like that but it should function now a lot of people get into newfangled coolants with you know colorants or additives or whatever else but I have always been a proponent of straight up water and I will show you guys why because even with plain water you can see that the flow over time like water will erode pretty much anything we've managed to strip the nickel plating from some parts of this block exposing the original copper also even with pure water although that is with a couple of drops of biocide we still get a little bit of like you know corrosion and stuff like that but what you don't see is any microbial growth because the thing is a little bit of corrosion or a little bit of erosion which is what we're looking at here is not going to kill your system microbial growth that will dunk up your blocks like that and it is pretty much game over it's funny it feels like such a downgrade going from the h EDT or the high end desktop platform of your to a mainstream solution but not only does this consumer you know mainstream CPU have just as many processing course they are so much faster than my old rig that I'm expecting and CPU alone a double digits performance uplift it's not so now that our motherboards in we're ready for the main event of this upgrade so this is it looks so good I almost feel bad taking the like sexy air-cooled shroud outfit but we definitely have to do that so this is part of Corsairs entire new lineup of full custom water cooling products it took them a long time to enter this segment of the market but they've been a big name in the a i/o cooler space for a long time so I'm excited to see just how this new endeavor works out for them overall I have to say I'm not like my initial impressions of the of the build quality don't really blow me away like especially when you compare the stock backplate which is like this thick friggin thing this looks very plain and kind of flimsy by comparison also their block seems to be designed to help save them some copper because this shroud on the outside while very stylish and sexy looking is made of aluminum which is quite a lot cheaper and then they've also gone with some kind of molded plastic for the fittings up here that is so this saves them like a lot of copper but when you compare that to the high-end blocks from other manufacturers it really sets them behind in terms of build quality okay so here's the situation I've got the board cleaned up so we're pretty much ready to mount man that is a big GPU full couple key developments we've got the Corsair block installed actually on the card it looks pretty sharp I will give them that not bad Corsair not bad so our GPU is gonna go in here and then out like this a little something like that so let's go ahead and plug in the motherboard first so I actually had the length of this cable done up custom for this case and the old motherboard so that means it's gonna be a little bit wonky now go ahead and pop that in there the good news is that it fits I was really worried that this reservoir bracket was gonna interfere but it like just barely fits on there so that's pretty sick all right GPU is going in my original tube here might make it that looks so tacky I love it so much it's horrible that's it ladies and gentlemen that is my upgraded personal rig until I upgrade anything else about it however oh oh that's heavy that's really really heavy ah one moment please all right so I borrowed a power cable I found my trusty mini funnel and we are ready to fill this puppy [Music] whoo there goes oh it's backwards wait there may actually still be time to rectify this one moment if I flip it up onto its faceplate you can see the water draining out of the CPU block there see that now the GPU doesn't matter doesn't care which way it flows but our CPU block does so what we need to do is we need to get a new run that goes from here to here instead and from here to here of course that would be cruel and unusual punishment if we didn't at least see if it runs the game well and also if it works so I grabbed Riley's monitor off his desk which happens to be the exact model that I used for gaming at home and we're gonna go ahead and fire this baby up hey there where's my keyboard and mouse all right mm options oh look at that it defaulted me to lot's of crazy settings that's cool okay I will just load up this sandbox game alright oh that is so much better so by comparison with my old system I was running at medium details and I was chugging down to as low as like 40 FPS now there's actually a framerate counter up in the top left here I'm at Ultra everything except I turned anti-aliasing down to 2x and I'm hovering in the 45 to 70 frames per second which is fine for a game like this more than fine especially if you're running a g-sync monitor thanks to IBM check it out at the link in the video
