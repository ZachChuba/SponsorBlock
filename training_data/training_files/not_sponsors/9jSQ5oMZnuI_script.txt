a place where you can create your super dope websites [Music] [Applause] [Music] this most detailed circle drawing I started out with a circle at first I didn't really know where I wanted to go but I started to think what have I turned this circle into more of a machine kind of thing and that turned into a portal like machine and I thought why not let there know step out [Music] first I was gonna keep it so that it's just the portal and a nose but then I started thinking the backgrounds getting a little bit boring why not I add some more Avengers I started adding some Avengers I started with the Hulk but I wanted to make this interesting too so new year new made you know started 2019 I rewrote 2018 a couple of times by accent and I really really want to change that so this time for the entire piece I made the portal the oh so it's 2019 and I wanted to make each of them represent like a small part of the vendors [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this was kind of a challenging art challenge but at the same time I had a lot of fun with that I told you guys to submit your entries so later on I'll show your entries as well you know what you guys this is the year of the artist under this is the year the artists army is finally gonna step up and you know what why were a bikini smashed 420 lights can't we do it you guys can we get 420 likes on this video a little bit more serious while we're added recently a few of my fans have contacted me saying they got roasted and bullied for their artwork and to me that is just not okay because since they're part of the artists army I feel like I have the responsibility to stand up for them if you guys ever have something that you guys are uncomfortable with someone's bullying you someone's picking on you you gotta stand up for it and if you really can't come to us the artist rocker is here for you we're on your side you don't have to do this alone and I read the comments and the people made about their art and honestly those are not constructive at all they're just really really mean comments I feel like there's a difference between criticism advice and just straight-up mean common criticism I feel like they just say the best stuff about you but at the same time there's always some truth to it so it's good to take a look at it and just see if we can apply a cheer so constructive criticism I feel like they give you some advice and they tell you what to do to make yourself a little bit better which is actually really nice and hopeful straight-up mean comments I feel like this con decay is kind of bling it's just straight-up mean and there's not really much substance to it and they're just being mean for the heck of it so I'd say just ignore those and come to us if you really have any issues this either hard to start me is here for each other I feel like I'm getting a little bit off topic since this is most detailed circle challenge but at the same time I feel like this is something I really have to address because it really pisses me off but my fans are getting bullied and stuff and I don't think that's a bad and honestly the world of art kind of upsets me a little bit it always seems like artists are always depressed they're always going through our flocks they're always complaining about something and I feel like for the artists army we shouldn't be making excuses for ourselves you know what we own up to it we push ourselves you got to go through a little bit of pain before you can get to success you know it might seem like it's blow now you might not be motivated but everyone goes through that at some point and it really matters how you push through that and that's the guy that's gone through a lot of stuff myself I feel like you just got to push through get to the other side there's always gonna be better stuff out there and things are just gonna get better I feel like that's why I always emphasize staying on the daily grind keeping those pencils moving and just not giving up 20:19 is gonna be the year in the artist song I don't ever let anyone tell you what to do or just keep your head high and even if you're not the best right now make sure you work at it and you're gonna beat them someday enough a brand team here is the Avengers detailed circle challenge you guys hit the montage [Music] [Music] [Music] the link in the description down below so while I was
