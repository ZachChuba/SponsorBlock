all right today we're doing a viewer request Connie does not like how can store-bought pizza sauce taste neither do I so we're gonna make our own it's really easy you need one 28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes get a really good variety if you can find san marzano they are the best all right Google that you've heard me talk about those before really really nice sweet variety but any high quality whole peeled tomatoes gonna work you're gonna need some garlic come on so I'm gonna go probably 3 or 4 cloves of that that's up to you a couple tablespoons a nice olive oil all right we're gonna spice it up a little bit with some red pepper flakes about a half a teaspoon for me all right we're gonna need some salt of course I'm gonna use about a half a teaspoon to start and then I will adjust that later and a little pinch of sugar okay maybe a third of a teaspoon just a pinch sweeten it up just a tad some dry Italian herbs it's 1/2 a teaspoon of your classic dry Italian mix that's marjoram thyme basil rosemary oregano and then 1/2 a teaspoon well maybe a little more half a teaspoon officially of dry oregano that's straight oregano now step 1 take your tomatoes out of the can and we're gonna have to take the seeds out ok one reason the canned store-bought sauce tastes kind of lousy is they process it with the seeds which gives it kind of an off bitter flavor so and by the way this is for demo purposes only don't cut tomatoes in your hand like I'm doing here like an idiot all right that was just to show you so cut them in half on a cutting board whoops they did that on purpose just to show you that they're slippery you got to be careful so cut them in half on a cutting board and Whitin and just squeeze in you should tip your knife just trying to get out as much as the seeds as you can don't take an hour to do this you're just gonna try to get most of the seeds out and there you go all right now what you can do and what I'm going to do I'm going to strain the tomato juice back in and just throw away the seeds some purists some pizza sauce aficionados think you should throw the juice and the seeds away that doesn't i don't think it makes that big of a difference now what you want to do is give them a crush traditionally you do with your hands because that's how my grandma did it that's mom did it that's how my aunt does it that's how my uncle does it that's how I do it so if you're a little you know more dainty you can get a potato masher and do it that way but you want to cook these with the tomato pretty much broken up I'm gonna explain later again at the end of this you're gonna have some options if you have one of these food mills also very nice for this job it'll actually crush them and strain out the seeds at the same time but there we go either way you did it there's our can of tomatoes ready to make a sauce with now it starts with a warm saucepan it's on low I put in my olive oil I put in my three cloves of chopped garlic and I'm just gonna bring that slowly up the temperature with a wooden spoon just give a little stir until the garlic starts to sing meaning I can hear it start to sizzle by the way that same sounds much better than Italian although I forgot it but anyway as soon as the garlic just starts to sizzle you just hear it start singing to you you're gonna add your dry herbs that's the oregano the mixed Italian herbs and your chili pepper chili flakes your chili pepper all right now this technique is actually borrowed from Indian and Asian cuisine really common they warm up or give their the dry herbs and spices a little saute before they add the wet ingredients brings out more of the flavor I really like the technique it's a little bit dangerous though because if your heats too high you burn that stuff you get a mess just a terrible mess on your hands but since we are on low heat I don't think there's much danger here so that was just literally 2030 seconds in the warm oil and now we're gonna add our tomato all right so dump in your tomato again that's a 28 ounce can all right let's give it a stir now we're gonna simmer this on low for approximately 30 minutes so I want you to add your salt it's about a half a teaspoon of course taste and adjust that later all right little pinch of sugar just sweetens it up just a hair all right and now I'm gonna add half a cup of water because some of the liquid obviously is gonna evaporate out of this I don't want this to get too thick I don't want this to turn into tomato paste and I just think it simmers because I do like this simmer like I said for about a half-hour 40 minutes so I really cook in that garlic in the herbs and then and all the flavors so to me that half cup of water that's going to evaporate up out of there you know after a half hour now here is the secret ingredient baking soda this is grandma shin phonies secret top secret recipe in fact actually had a wait until she passed away before I could show it publicly for fear of retribution so what we're gonna do we're gonna add just a pinch that was like a sixteenth of a teaspoon of baking soda and the soda if you've ever made the little member of the volcano in science class the soda reacts with the acid in the tomato and this kind of little I don't know foam pink foam like substance comes to the top you skim that off and the theory is it actually makes improves the flavor of the sauce and you don't get heartburn so I don't know I'm not a scientist in fact if that's not true and it does nothing to do with it don't even send me that email I like to think that that works so that was for grandma and pony and then I'm gonna take my stick blender and give it a little buzz here you could leave it chunky if you want this from this point on this is totally up to you I do prefer a smooth pizza sauce some people prefer the chunky pre-mixed tomato sauce that especially if you're doing deep-dish people tend to like the chunkier but for me yeah I like it that way so there we go homemade pizza sauce so much better tasting not having those seeds in there makes a big difference possibly grandma Shin phonies baking soda a pinch trick did something to it what I'm going to do with this would you think I was going to do that I'm gonna make pizza all right so there's no top-secret tricks there in fact we will be making pizza dough very soon so stay tuned thank you for watching hope you're you
