you are beautiful I'll be quiet we must have just brought you in it's been a few hours since you've seen sunlight it's mental sleepy I'm just going to touch okay don't eat me I just want to run a few tests okay okay hopefully having you chained up down here will be a little bit safer than what happened to poor Sahni and beam those are my last Titans they are killed I won't let that happen to you mm-hmm you are far too precious precious precious precious what should we call you I'd like to think of a good name now let's see first things first let's figure out what type you are you look to be hmm one bit on the smaller side yet you were assemble more of the 8 to 14 meter Titan class was extraordinary three to six meter class I'm very large heads but yours is a bit more proportionate so you're not really fitting there don't get me wrong your your massive but not as big as some of the times we've seen now I've seen these seven meter have very large heads or ape-like stance the most common Titan so you thing do not be of that class we the 8 to 14 meter class Titans resemble humans the most and that seems to be you you're not very energetic at the moment but I'm going to attribute on to you not seeing the Sun for a while and the 15-metre Titans which you are certainly not large mouths pretty proportional your mouth measurements here okay now I don't see anything on the notes about you being an abnormal he's not ignore any human did not go to specific locations with any purpose just you tried to eat quite a few humans and I'm sure you have many now let me get some initial measurements so we could probably class you sort of I just couldn't wait to get down here and run some deaths on you beautiful beautiful beautiful now just hold still I'm going to measure the width of your mouth you don't hold the same proportions as a 15 meter class Titan would so I predict that you are quite small for your size and fitting in with the mm-hmm well this is good this is good this is good you pulled a little bit less of a threat to me and you see a bit of space down here so thank you for being on the smaller side you're going to stay put you don't really have an option there and I'm going to essentially do a little bit of an inventory on your body parts okay you do have two eyes I'm going to test their vision I have a nose or nose like structure at least let me just feel under see I don't feel any you're not breathing no tighten yet we've captured has needed to breathe okay your mouth clearly I'm going to go ahead and just lift back your gums ok sizers here let's count them open your mouth all right many teeth well some Titans only have canines some all the incisors okay Oh eating a human quite recently haven't you yeah breath is astoundingly terrible what you have I predict no digestive drunk no reproductive organs and no real purpose for consuming humans what titans haven't consumed humans over a hundred years all of a sudden they come in and it doesn't seem like they're doing it for nutrients since there is no digestive tract and we find regurgitate it humans absolutely everywhere the tract doesn't exist there's no digestion involved they simply stew in a puddle of your stomach acid or days weeks until you're full and then you regurgitate them and move on you don't die there's no nutritional value but you seem to refuse to eat other animals or vegetation we're going to give you a little bit of a boot test here see if anything will do appetite I'm confused at the lack of reproductive organs see we're not quite sure how you reproduce why there are so many of you know when you just take a look inside your eye if I cover your eyes mmm no people retraction open or dilation depending on the light short that's due to your Hofstra lack of sunlight sunlight must the moon is out but that's of ice we have you down here lanterns maybe the moonlight now I'm going to put my hand up I want you to follow it with your eyes Paolo no sign of intelligent life but that's normal almost past I've displayed acute intelligence but I think you're cute anyway you seem to be able to detect humans doesn't really know I'm here but um we must test your vocal chords are you capable of roaring are you capable of making the sounds are you capable of advanced human language even the simplistic human language now I knew one to look out for your [Music] perhaps crawl in tulip here mouth with me accounted boy your tongue now we might have to do an excavation of your insides unless I already did that to arms torso no reproductive organs links feet let me count your toes ten toes interesting don't outgrowth mom fingernail growth let's see damn you strapped down poor thing I'm going to take your temperature and just see different parts of your body or Darren temperatures and cheeks hmm in your mouth very good very good very good your torso your leg everything points to you expending mass amounts of energy nutrients everything that you need I taught you not god forbid we cut a slice off of you it's even hotter burn my hand on the muscle on the Titan before okay I'm going to detect you have working vocal cords no I didn't put my hands around her throat and you just try a little whole hour maybe just a little a little roar something something for me call the sneeze pick up interesting I'm just thinking interesting you've certainly heard humans and Titans make similar noises but now if I poke that was something will you make a sound let's give you a little shock No well what happens if I shock different areas of your face can you feel it when do you react poor bean well when I got his eye with a spear he didn't like that very much at all it was very hard for me to do to him I left him very much Sawney didn't react the same way so now we have to test it on you see if you can react to touch we have to pain I'm going to stop with a fairly low voltage no matter crank it up a bit and just go all the way okay stand back a little bit now that's more like it we'll be very interested to hear evidence or you won't but I'll make them interested Beyond response and how many volts with that okay seemed like you do have some sense of feeling at least in your face and depending on your level of exhaustion now the first thing that really intrigued me about studying you it's ready York I was after I had decapitated a Titan and a little bit of an immature rage I kicked the head across the field I was blown away by how light it was incredibly light I'm sure I could squat I really tried but what I'm going to do is how is this weight and compare it to your head we won't be cutting it off yet although you should be able to roll back quite quickly don't wait until the Sun comparatively as I predicted about it's the same that's not going to be exactly the same Intel but I just wanted to see it better watch there okay that's fine these are all just preliminary doesn't study I just let myself get carried away all right let's try to feed you oh not humans there's no one around that I would feed you they're all sleeping okay I do want to see if we can get you interested in any of the fools me up here how about a nice luscious juicy nutritious sniff it you don't you're not even following you with your eyes hello hello well films my least delicious food I addict offer you service from the kitchens I had a potato in here but it seems like someone may have gone to it first can I interest you in some bread light doughy powdery [Applause] right nothing you didn't try it nothing okay how about don't peel just like the flash of a human smell okay anything eight boot oh no I believe you're more interested in my hand okay how about some sweet squishy mochi bread anything anything okay that's all right to be quite honest with you I wasn't expecting any sort of reaction beyond what you made me so I'm proud of you I'm proud yes okay it was the prettiest Titan in the world I'd like to take some samples oh so alive oh you're okay well the regeneration of lost body parts is astounding not sure if we can replicate it in any way we can understand it in any way stop it in any way because it seems like only cutting out the base of your neck is really going to kill you so I can do almost any deaths on the world on you maybe I'll be just fine that's why you're my lovely little precious I just collect okay now this I'm going to get in your eyeball so you go ahead keep that open okay don'ts enjoy thank you next up your nose lovely you have your saliva and finally I'm going to beat you with this stick so that he won't bleed slightly and I'll be able to get a bit of that so you go ahead and just stay where you are thank you look at that no wound is healing already samples we could get you to drink anything I have two options one a delicious quite sought-after type of wine resembles blood maybe I could entice you can it tight and get drunk hmm I'm glad just open your mouth and it's not just rippling up higher than that well why don't we try animal reaction to liquid you never know you never know you just have to try it all I'm simply working with what I have here before they let me get out my fun toys later okay no reaction to liquids no well that smell I have something very potent well that perked you up a little bit oh oh don't you look so cute lively write this down okay we've been doing reached our limit with your reaction however I leave this in your own will see the estar learning whatever the smells what they mean I could just smell it drain it Titan hmm like this well we might as well check and your lung capacity at that point if we could force you to take breaths no exhalation capacity don't want to pop them I just want to see what happens just hold it the Aaron interesting all right if you're not going to exhale it then I want that air to stay here alone this as long as possible so we're going to go ahead I'm gonna clamp you down for the night mausi her gonna fit this over there should be horribly uncomfortable I'm not quite sure you even have too much Sun so anything that's going on is there anything else I wanted you lacking the skin no bleeding not anymore jacked-up teeth I'm going to assume you don't have a functioning digestive tract I might be able to force feed you something tomorrow but as of now you have no interest in any typical edible human food you just eat more and more human until you order to tape it's very gluttonous of you you don't value we're going to assume that the lack of sunlight that's what's causing you to be a little bit sleepy we can run some tests on that tomorrow perhaps on a full moon clear night low intelligence but that's to be expected mmm detecting humans but not quite being able to follow not too much unpredictability again quite small I'm quite sleepy high temperature high temperature should activity should be meeting a massive lightweight just like the others I'm going to assume that your speed is quite fast but we're not going to be toasting Matt and your generation seems to be working just fine reacting to hi hi lots of pain and that's a good thing to note here tests that we do tomorrow well you are simply gorgeous and I can't wait to play with you again tomorrow we're gonna learn so much about you I didn't introduce myself my name is Angie we'll have to give you a name goodnight sleep well gonna go get some rest and I'll be back bright and early you
