Oh No here we go look look they go oh he's actually looking in welcome back everybody to tears a driver I hope you're doing very well today we're gonna be looking at a brand new software update this is xx xx dot 24.6 dot for quite a long one and there's been a few really cool updates so let's have a look you're all awesome thank you very much for helping ok enough about that let's jump into this so the biggest thing is the backup camera improvements you can now view video streams coming from your side repeater cameras for added visibility around the vehicle when the backup camera is visible simply swipe to display the repeater camera video feeds so all we need to do is select the rear camera and as you can see it's already appeared up so you can actually get this to hide so if you swipe it down you can hide it but I don't know why you would and there you go you basically have your left and right repeater and it looks exactly obviously as you would expect from the mirrors here's some footage of it driving it does look really really cool and I did like the system I liked being able to see it myself as a passenger I like being able to see both of the mirrors Holly said it was a cool gimmick as she would draw as she was driving but she didn't actually look at it herself she just looked her mirrors except we did use it when we were parking because these here show the lines perfectly and sometimes Holly doesn't know she's quite in the lines and she opens her doors to check whereas now she doesn't need to she can just look down into these and she'll see exactly that she is part perfectly or a little bit skew whiff so it's a really cool improvement I really do like it what I would like to see is all of the cameras obviously accessible and a 360 bird's-eye view as you do get in BMWs outies and lots of other cars actually where you can swipe around and have a look around this car should have that it's a really kind of basic advanced feature if that makes sense and I hope tears to bring that soon one thing I would say though is the colouring is pretty bad in these two side cameras I assume that they've got to keep the bit rate as low as possible but you will be able to see then in diff like conditions which is pretty good there's no customization so you can't move them around so you can't select to zoom in for example for the rear view camera when I'm driving I would love to be able to zoom in about 50% and kind of sit this area because this is a little bit too wide for me while I'm driving I'd like to be zoomed in a tiny bit and yeah I just like to be able to kind of move these around and customize the layout but really cool and I love that in the update another camera upgrade is the dashcam viewer improvements we suggested these viewers on our first ever dashcam preview video so Thank You Tessa for watching our videos and listening to our community here on the test the driver YouTube channel to make century mode videos easier to review we have added a red dot along the video scrubber I wonder who suggested that to indicate the moment when a century mode event was triggered when playing a video the dashcam viewer will skip ahead and begin playback right before that point so let's have a look at this shall we and let's see how it works so this will pop up our most recent one let's go into it let's have a look at the dashcam first I don't know what any of these are so let's have a look at this one but you see right there there's actually a red dot that shows you where the century mode is and it has kind of played before it but it's played about a minute or so before it so I'm going to scrub forward as you'll see it's still not great on here you'll see that when you actually scrub it doesn't always put it to exactly where you want it to scrub to so let's go to the bit and this is apparently when the dashcam viewer saved just here so I'm intrigued for some reason it saved this video footage I'm not 100% sure why it looks absolutely fine to me so yeah that's a little bit strange let's go on to the sentry footage Chippenham right so we were at we're at Aldi carpark here and something happens in again two minutes so let's fast-forward it a little bit oh we've got someone looking here we go sorry about all my shaking by the way I suffer from a central tremors and EPD is that it oh no here we go look look they go oh he's actually looking in so that is really cool so it showed us exactly this guy is admiring the car which is nice he's gonna go around the back yeah this is this is really cool yeah he's admiring the car so that's awesome that's really cool that that guy was looking at it he had his mask on as well so let's have a look at the car part can see let's see else this is actually pretty fun to do so it's a minute long it hasn't brought it to where the sentry mode has activated so I don't know why it says it does that but let's see if it scrubs correctly yeah that wasn't too bad okay so it's gonna go off in a few seconds I wonder why oh there we go it's just someone you can see it's a little bit glitchy little bit glitchy there that was a bit weird so he literally just walked straight past us with the trolley I'm really surprised that that set that off let's have a look at one final one shall we actually this looks like the exact same one it's the same guy coming the other way that is brilliant this is definitely gonna be my new favorite thing just going through videos and finding kind of what set off the car is actually really cool to do so here it's this kids it's the kids dancing oh you actually saw the car flash the kids dancing set off that sentry mode clip you'll see how many of them I've recorded though and each one is eight minutes long or like at least up to ten minutes long which is pretty insane so we've got so much footage here that we don't need to see and it only really needs to record maybe like 30 seconds before so it literally all it recorded was that guy walking past that I'm amazed that set it off this maybe is a little bit too sensitive yeah look at this again a 10 minute and 49 second clip for just this one little bit of sentry mode and what happens on it looks like it's gonna be yeah it's this family here she's looking at the car the kids just like looking forwards he's going on I think she's yeah she's looking at the badge she definitely look at the badge we like what kind of cars that that's quite I do like seeing that I do like seeing that is good to see and then you can kind of you can kind of just snoop on people and see what what they what they do oh okay it's frozen I guess it's frozen oh oh whoa okay so well look at look at this okay so it's definitely still a bit buggy I said it I said it felt buggy because like it doesn't scrub correctly okay so let's try that again so I want to see this whole clip for example let's see say something happens in about 30 seconds I want to see this this bit of footage here this is really really important for me now will it show it or is it bugging out every time or was that just a one-off let's see oh no it's a complete bug look at that it's actually set me back to eight minutes so if I scrub forwards okay now we can see past it so like you see what I mean it's pretty buggy for some reason it will throw you back and sometimes it won't scrub correctly and they just they just get in the car and and off they go so a little bit buggy but I really like the improvements we've also got some tuning improvements now I'm not sure if this is globally because I don't know if everyone has tuned in with their cars with this update we've improved the usability and discoverability of tuning stations and podcasts so it's easier to browse content we've also added the ability to adjust playback speed of podcasts up to 2x that's really good actually because sometimes when you're watching or listening to a podcast some people do it to these videos I like to speed them up by 1.5 times or sometimes 2 times and you can get through so much more content in a short period of time so that's actually pretty cool as usual the tune in to you tune in tap on the media icon and select tune in walk away door lock improvements you now have the option to disable walk away door lock when your vehicle is parked at home tap controls lock and select exclude home so controls we've gone to here click locks like that and then as we scroll down walk away door lock is on and you can exclude it at home I guess that's cool if that you had an issue with that I didn't know that was an issue so I'm intrigued to know if anyone had that let me know in the comment section actually if that's improved life for you for whatever reason on route battery warm up so the car will now actually precondition the battery get the battery ready and warm so it can accept as much charge as possible not just as superchargers but also any other fast charging locations so they have a little battery sorry a lightning bolt icon on them and you can actually pre warm your battery so if you go to an ion a tea for example you can pre warm it now that's a really nice upgrade and of course new language support is included and that's it for this new update sadly here in the UK we're still missing huge features in autopilot traffic lights stop signs stopping and continuing if there's a lead car we don't have any of that yet so hopefully we'll get that update very very soon let me know what you think about the update down below in the description until next time thank you for watching don't forget drive safe
