to be late or constrained or facing weak demand remember how Jim Cramer explained it yeah it was very important to spread the rumor that that both Verizon and belt and ATT decided they don't like the phone right very easy one to do because it's also you want to spread the rumor that it's not going to be ready from Mac world and this is very easy because the people who write about Apple want that story and you can claim that it's credible because you spoke to someone at Apple because Apple isn't in it doesn't right they're not gonna comment and I so it's really an ideal short but a few years ago when I and others called them out on it and it blew up spectacularly there was a major shift in strategy from big sketchy reports to a kind of slow jamming the neg The Wall Street Journal in particular seems unable to print the word iPhone anymore without some weird glitch in there autocorrect system changing it to declining iPhone lackluster iPhone flagging iPhone week stalling faltering slumping slowing waning sputtering down turning business damaging woes threatening troubled iPhone and that's just over the last six months from there at the Soraa subscription it almost seems designed to make you think no one wants the iPhone anymore when in reality it reflects so many people having wanted and gotten the iPhone that both the business and technology have crossed the chasm from early explosive growth to maturity in a decade flat sure you can play some games with gimmicks and experimental form factors and tech pundits will love you for it or run at no or below margin but that burns out your base or your business rather than continuing to build strong customer relationships and sustainable product lines which is why I think what I've been saying for the last several years is proving true once you've built up your primary business into a platform you can then use that platform to build up everything else including other primary businesses the iPhone despite not selling as many units as it did before a billion people had already bought them is still slowly growing as a platform but more than that everything from Apple watch to air pods to Apple music and Apple pay are growing spectacularly off its back yes iPhone revenue was down 9% from the same quarter last year but everything else was firing to such a degree total revenue actually still grew by 1.8% and that means Apple has largely proven itself capable of growing beyond the iPhone which of course means Wall Street has to now figure out how to project nervousness over a far more diversified success highlights from Apple's q4 20:19 conference call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri included the announcement that Apple card which they're calling the most successful card launch in history will soon let customers buy a new iPhone and pay it off over 24 months at 0% interest and still get 3% cashback because Apple card purchase personally I'm still waiting for Apple card and Apple pay cash to start moving into additional geographies but along with the iPhone upgrade program the compelling idea of iPhone as a service continues to become more and more of a reality I'd love to see subscription Apple watches and air pods and other products as well pay monthly get new devices annually feed or refurbish secondary market and ensure responsible recycling of what can be and disposal of what can't be and you have a better business for Apple and less digital graveyards accumulating for customers iPhone 11 as many expected is proving the most popular of the new iPhones the same was true last year with the iPhone 10 are but I think Apple was smart to change up the pricing and the branding always make customers feel like they're getting more for more never that they're settling for less for less I pad was up 17% which probably reflects just how strong Apple's current lineup is from the $329 entry-level model which keeps getting better and better to the new mid-level air and mini to the really strong iPads pro right at the top and I think that shows despite some stumbles in the middle years the iPhone platform still has a halo and when Apple can understand the upgrade cycle and deliver a compelling lineup year after year the mark response there wasn't as much talk about the Mac this quarter because there hasn't been as much to talk about with the Mac last year by the end of October we had updated MacBook Pros and all new MacBook Airs and Mac minis we got spec bumped MacBook Pros and IMAX earlier this year and a preview of the all new Mac Pro back in June but we're still waiting on whatever is next for the MacBook Pro and to see if Apple can really keep the MacBook Air and Mac Mini updated on a yearly basis likewise the iMac pro is going on two years without an update the Mac was still super profitable for Apple and like the iPad more than half the people buying them were first-time buyers which is great but Apple has really been winning back the faithful over the last year or so and I really hope they close out 2019 just as strongly in that regard wearables which is what Apple calls watch air pods and beats grew over 30% ECG functionality which faces region by region regulatory hurdles is now available in 32 regions a whopping three quarters of Apple watch buyers were also new to the product as well which is something I think tech pundits still keep missing amid their annuals should you upgrade annually spiel unlike the billion big iPhone market there's still a huge untapped market for Apple watch and it'll be interesting to see how the 199 Apple watch 3 addresses that also the new air pods Pro nothing much was reported on home and accessories but that deserves its own video in the near future then their services those were up 18% I still think there are some legitimate challenges and criticisms over some of the aspects here including revenue from Google for default search engine placement and the continued abuse of app store subscriptions by a subset of unscrupulous apps and developers which is something that Apple really has to clamp down on but when you look at how well existing services like Apple music iCloud and Apple pay are doing which is now in 49 markets - the gist launch news + apple arcade and the about to be launched TV + and stalwarts like Apple care it's getting harder and harder to say Apple just doesn't get services they get them and they're investing in them including bundling a free year of TV + with hardware purchases and for students with Apple music subscriptions and hopefully more bundles to come we can all argue about fatigue in the era where each media category is essentially flattened down to one small monthly subscription but management fatigue is real and something platform companies like Apple can help centralize and improve and that goes beyond subscriptions as well when you step back and stop looking at each of these businesses as separate businesses and look at them as what I think they really are pieces of more singular more holistic puzzles being carefully put into place that I think things get really interesting for Apple's future including the lackluster flagging week stalling faltering slumping slowing whatever else myopic narratives you wanna pile on it iPhone more on that soon only partially and thanks to all of you for
