it's really dangerous to build your brand on being really fast for one thing speed is quantifiable so you can't just say it's magic or it turns you into professional photographer and then expect everyone to buy your products based on their feelings for another thing it puts such an obvious target on your back I mean it's not like any of your competitors are trying to make their devices slower and that is what makes one plus's accomplishment here so impressive the 1 plus 7 pro is hands down the fastest Android device that I have ever held in my hand and I'm gonna show you guys what I mean after this technology check it out at the link below [Music] let's get the bad stuff out of the way right now the 1 plus 7 Pro doesn't have a headphone jack though in fairness neither do most flagship phones these days so harping on that feels like background noise especially when it also falls short in some other key areas one it lacks any wireless charging when leaders like Huawei and Samsung have moved on to high-speed wireless charging and even wireless power sharing 2 it carries no independently validated water or dust resistance rating when even Apple has been doing this for years now 3 it issues other add-ons and features beloved by Android enthusiasts like expandable storage IR blasters or removable batteries and for finally it's just plain not cheap anymore parent company BBK Electronics has obviously set very clear expectations that the oneplus brand needs to move up market in order to survive preferring to use divisions like real me and vivo to attack budget competitors like wall weighs honor and shammies poco phone brands so we follow that out of the way why do I love this thing so much well it starts with the feel in the hand oneplus has taken a huge leap forward with this generation the 7 pro features curved Gorilla Glass 5 for both the back and the screen that's a first for them it's got ideally positioned lock volume rocker and do-not-disturb buttons along with corners that are shaped perfectly to fit comfortably in a cupped palm in both portrait and landscape orientations now it's heavy about the same weight as a note 9 but with that heft comes a heck of a lot of phone the display is simply put outstanding this is one pluses first 1440p class display so folks with sharper eyes than me will probably appreciate that but the thing that stood out to me was the configurability oneplus holds nothing back here for example you can switch to DC control to reduce flicker which is sick and instead of hiding color profiles behind ambiguous terms like photo or vivid they allow the user to quickly and easily select their color space of choice and adjust the white point that's a huge one for me over the already excellent OLED panel on the galaxy s 10 plus which is locked into a warmer white point than I would prefer in its color accurate profile and it gets even better HDR 10 plus certification no not CH no hole punch no distractions now purists might still criticize the heavily rounded corners but I'd say after about 30 seconds of wide aspect ratio content on this phone I suspect most people will completely forget about it this is the most immersive phone movie watching experience that I've had yet and yes some of us watch movies on our films deal with it the only thing on my wish list here would be always-on functionality I've got to praise the onboard speakers as well LG and huawei took big Gamble's transitioning to vibrating screen technology for their earpiece speakers [Music] and while it paid off in terms of in call audio quality in my opinion they both delivered inferior video watching experiences oneplus opted for a right side bottom firing speaker and a super slim amplified earpiece speaker that between the two of them deliver a very satisfactory stereo effect even if they're not the loudest I've ever heard and they got to get kudos for that now let's get into my claims about the oneplus 7 pros incredible speed because like it sounds kind of hard to believe right since flagship phones all have basically the same hardware in them at this point the thing is though that tuning matters it starts with the in screen fingerprint sensor now I had pretty much accepted that the convenience of being able to unlock my phone without flipping it over came at the cost of slower authentication not anymore every device that you're looking at here has the latest updates the seven pro is just that much faster and you can complain that part of Samsung's poor showing here is that their animation is slow but the thing is that's part of the perception of speed like I don't like everything about oneplus as oxygen OS the task switcher only shows one task which i think is dumb and the fingerprint sensor actually happens to show up exactly where the clear-all notifications button is oops but overall oneplus has worked for years to purge their OS of unnecessary fluff in the form of things like lock animations it doesn't have one the screen just turns off and folder pop-ups so snappy so everything just feels fast and more importantly not just when it's brand new when I was trying to quantify my snappy experience with the 7 pro I grabbed a freshly formatted pixel 3 Excel and I was surprised that given the pixel threes reputation they were neck-and-neck in basically everything I did but then I logged into my Google account and installed all the same apps and immediately the difference became what you're looking at now and the cherry on top of all of that is the perceived increase in responsiveness from the 90 Hertz screen I am a huge proponent of high refresh rate and the 1 + 7 Pro is exactly why not only does every animation look more fluid but everything on the screen that's in motion looks higher definition like you can read text as you're scrolling back and forth like this actually that brings us pretty nicely to the camera now oneplus started out as the foam that was great except for the camera thank goodness it's cheap but over the last couple of generations they've really broken away from the pack not because they get the best DXL mark score or because they have amazing video recording quality that's still a weak point from my experience compared to my note 9 daily driver what oneplus does well though and the seven pros 48 megapixel main and wide-angle shooters are no exception is take whatever is in front of you and put it on your screen for better or for worse their app is super responsive yes not again and it's simple to use and on the image processing side they tend not to overdo anything like edge enhancement noise reduction or color saturation and I really like and respect their approach at least in normal mode their night mode was actually a bit of a mess for me the one night that I took it out as for the selfie camera out of the box it's sharp accurate and mostly free of weird beauty processing so pretty good in my book already but of course that's far from the coolest thing about it now a motor pop-up camera is in my mind the riskiest way to achieve a notch 'less display and that's because of the moving parts but oneplus claims that between the gasket that they've installed to keep out debris and their automatic retraction mechanism okay so let's go they validated it to be used a hundred and fifty times per day every day for five years and the thing is I have seen their R&D and testing center so alright guys innocent until proven guilty on this one now as for some of the new camera selling points I'm a little tepid on those the three times optical zoom lens definitely delivers more detail in faraway objects but at the cost of inferior processing now it's possible that this is something they can improve but it is only an 8 megapixel sensor so I probably wouldn't hold my breath I do have more good stuff to say though 30-watt warped charging is some pretty next-level stuff half of your charge over this is a four thousand milliamp hour battery in 30 minutes dang impressive I'm assuming I don't know I didn't use it but for good reason thing is battery life on the 60 was already great so adding nearly another 10 percent to its capacity could only serve to improve it and it did now the 7 Pro is still no two-day monster like the p30 pro but I regularly made it to the end of the day with 40% in the tank and I actually got all of my notifications so that's pretty good which brings us then to price for the first time second time actually but who's counting oneplus is pursuing a two tiered strategy focusing on the oneplus 7 pro in some markets and pushing the oneplus 7 a lower-cost beefed up 60 in others with this strategy then comes 1 + s biggest generational price hike yet if you're in a 7 pro market around $100 so then over twice as much as the original 1+1 does this still make sense the answer is yeah now bargain hunters out there might find that they prefer flagship killers like the f1 or unlocked no warranty international s tens on marketplaces like Amazon but for my part if a friend said to me look I've got a good job I want something decent which Android phone should I get for a noble experience I'd say if you don't absolutely need a headphone jack get a one plus seven pro because the thing is guys it's all about the software these days and as we discovered during our five-year
