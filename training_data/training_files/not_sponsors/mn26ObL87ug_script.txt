what's going on one Jeremy here from the quartering in Sykes this might be the cringy is commercial I've ever seen I think I'm more inclined to buy Gillette razors after their famous commercial then Google stadia now before we get into the commercial some recent updates stadia in fact looks like it's been downloaded about 175,000 times in the first two weeks not exactly anything to write home about but it's important to have some numbers before I get into that plus not one not two but three free months Google City app available both on Android and iOS may offer may offer the best insight yet to the approximate user base of the newly launched cloud only games terming platform that's because stadia is required to purchase games for reason that cannot be done via your PC for the time being of course the app itself can be downloaded without having the actual CD account but that'd be pointless on its own now maybe some people decided to try it out or I don't know it's probably I'd say let's give it a 10% margin of error while sensor towers estimated over 175,000 downloads up until the November 19th it was reported by games industry since the tower was also added that over 90% of the downloads came from Android platform which is perhaps unsurprising as iOS currently stream as iowa's cannot currently stream games at all United States got the lion's share of download distribution with 41 percent now some rough numbers to be honest with you that means the 10% of people that download it on iOS aren't using it I mean so you'd want to cut let's say 20,000 people out of the hundred seventy-five thousand right away and also that only 41% of 175,000 which would be let's call it what is that four times seventeen sixty calls 70,000 so between 60 and 70 thousand downloads in the United States that's it in fact let me just do that math so if we do 175 thousand times 41 percent okay that's 71 actually want to take a time 69 percent so one hundred seventy five thousand one 2500 times point six nine that's a hundred and twenty thousand downloads in the United States then you would also cut 10 percent out of that because they download an iOS and they're not even likely a stadia user then so a puny hundred thousand downloads in the United States is a pretty sad launch for something that is essentially free to download certainly not a big launch which will line up with reports of pre-orders being below expectations still as much an above the figure cannot be taken as an accurate representation from stadia subscriber base for that left to wait for an official statement from Google which we probably won't ever get when we look at the pre-orders this is back on November 19th Google City officially launches today and thus far response from reviewers and players has been somewhat muted but people actually buying in new platform in order to play the launch you had to purchase say Dias foundered Edition or premier editions which come with a chromecast ultra and stadia controller from 129 according to reliable Kotaku insider Schreyer senior pre-orders were well below expectations and fax writers go far to say to dub the CD launch is a monumental flop Google City is out today and already looks to be a monumental flop I heard from one person involved that pre-orders were below expectations question is will they eventually stop trying to sell games and switch to an all-you-can-eat subscription model or just let it die I don't think Google's gonna give up on Cydia that quickly they're building multiple game studios as we speak but it wasn't it was asinine to think that they could sell games at full price on this thing they need to pivot even if it means losing some of the biggest Triple A games I agree they need to I honestly think they need to figure out how to make it ad supported they absolutely have to make it ad supported now it should be mentioned that city is founder Edition actually quote sold out the premier Edition is replacement that doesn't mean a whole lot as Google's never really revealed how many founders editions were being made available if there were a million founder editions sure selling out it's impressive if there were 50,000 that's less than an accomplishment based on Schreyer comments it sounds like Google was expecting the founders Edition to move a lot faster as mentioned response to CD has been mixed thus far with many gamers not games not deville delivering the visual splendor google promised destiny to only runs at 1080p at medium settings and again there are bigger problems for whether consumers are ever going to be interested in the city of business model I don't think so look if you're asking people you can have all the gender-neutral controllers you want but if you're asking people to pay full price for games that in this particular case they already own alright so down the line when you get more games that say people don't already own that may be a better litmus test but everything I'm hearing from anybody who's reliably played the game reviewed it Paul Tassie for example the experience is awful and you just don't come back for that and of course they end up having to respond to initially quoting the future up to 8k 120 FPS they would respond to criticism essentially stadia streams at 4k and 60fps Google Rob that includes all aspects of our graphics pipeline from the game to the screen GPU encoder chromecast Ultra all outputting 4k to 4k TVs with the appropriate internet connection developers making Cydia games work hard to deliver the best streaming experience for every game like you see on all platforms this includes a variety of techniques to achieve the best over quality we give developers and freedom to achieve blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah this is of course after it was revealed that none of the current games on CD are anywhere near 4k their 1080p running up scaled to 4k which is of course not true 4k quote we expect that many developers can and in most cases will continue improve during games on stadia and because Cydia lives in our data centers developers are able to innovate quickly while delivering even better experiences directly to you without the need for patches or downloads now it's possible it's possible but again you only get in most cases one chance to launch and if it's a flop it always remains a flop it's very very difficult to shake off that bad taste you leave in everybody's mouths and now this ad which had dropped a few days ago which looks like a five gum ad is probably the most cringe inducing thing I've ever seen Google stadia hasn't had the best month its list of launch games was tiny and seemed Google panic right before lanch launch any more games people pre-ordered we're running in issues that couldn't actually use the service and reviews have been mixed they were negative with all that bad news floating around you might have missed this terrible awful cringe-inducing stadia launch trailer the first time I watch this trailer I quickly downloaded it and saved it to my computer why because it's so bad that I was worried Google might you ain't get off YouTube and try to hide it but fortunately for you it's still easily viewable on YouTube it's two minutes long and yet feels longer than that it seems to be trying to tap into the style of humor that was once very popular on the Internet the random for the sake of being random this was like 70% of YouTube back in 2008 that's fair and as a style of the internet humor grew in popularity ad agencies took notice so insurance and snack food commercials started following this trend with random humor and really they haven't stopped and now Google in a bid to look relevant and hip is leaning on this random humor in their stadia launch trailer then result appropriately for Google is a video that feels like was put together by a computer program that used algorithms to determine what young kids and gamers would like to see in an ad but all their data is like 10 years old so we end up with an ad that has funny costumes a silly special effects running gags a canoe made out of a living human being well so random so funny beyond the random jokes and imagery the trailers also filled with some stuff that is worth calling out for example they mention that unlike mentioned on like console stadia doesn't take up any space which is actually not true at least currently you still need space for a controller and a chromecast Ultra which true they take up less space but they do exist in the physical world another part of the trailer has a man in a club who later becomes a canoe wacky mentioned that Google Cydia has the games you're looking for well that's true if you're looking to play games that you already have or have already been put out in other platforms for months or more also it's true if you want to play any games from the small list of games currently available as writing it today come up to the ad range from shocked to how bad the ad looks to confusion on who this ad is targeting a few comments mentioned how the ad reminds them of those two five bubblegum commercials well let's take a look let's take a look I mean I think what I want to watch it with you because I think we all need to experience this I think it's important it's an important learning experience for all of us all right let's turn it down a little bit it's probably to me too loud alright oh my god who is that Reggie Watts right is that who that guy is by the way the trailer only has 46 thousand views and Google didn't really like who made this I'm pretty sure this ad is turning people off of stay Diaz the games you're looking for 20 games this commercial try so hard that it's almost adorable by the way he's wearing that gender-neutral wasabi green is this supposed to be Aspen Gold ha ha ha hey as a gold here what is even well yeah that is untrue right you need the chromecast which you know is small but you also hit out you need the controller too by the way who's complaining about game consoles taking up too much room is that even a complaint for K 60fps never really happened [Music] but they're not showing any of the input lag or the crashes or any of that other stuff this is bizarre so stay Diaz wormhole he found it ah okay that was funny what what the hell who even wrote this by the way did they show they showed um you know what's interesting they showed uh Borderlands and it's not even on here anybody else notice that so they're showing games that aren't even on stadia that's that's great also random go by stadia have a great day [Music]
