well hello there folks I'm Pruitt and this is Jim Davis and today we're gonna talk about adding tools to your role-playing game to make the stores better with gran Ellis wait where's grant where did it go let's talk to grant on web do you this wait for this book link in the comments and description grant Ellis what are you doing here well I've come you collect your souls and your taxes none of my friends I'm here to talk about story and play and role-playing games I'm happy to do it with my friends and and we love having you here your you're coming out with a game of your own so once you give us a brief run-through of who you are just besides you know playing on my game and Jim's game and running our twitch and just being an all-around swell guy so I'm an independent content creator for tabletop role-playing games I'm the twitch producer on web diems twitch channel I've guessed it on the podcast a few times I'm a designer of games I'm a goal to any winner in 2019 and I'm kick-starting a game coming up which is all about dark fairy tales in fifth edition' fantasy role-playing when you're designing what are you leaning towards as the role-playing or is it mechanics like how do you come in designing something like this so the first approach I take is I think about what problem am i solving for and one of the problems I'm solving for is how do you take a rules framework and solve different story types for example there might be war stories there might be mysteries there might be heartwarming tales romance there might be stories about going on long travels political intrigue political intrigue broken hearts patching families back together as well as monster hunting and going deep into dungeons I figure each of those things kind of fit in different boxes so can I create mechanical subsystems there's a technical way of saying when do we roll dice when do we tick clocks when do we pass cards etc and apply that to a tabletop role-playing game for my game are taking the core of fifth edition and then we're adding some of these subsystems to it yeah you're creating like things to support styles of play or goals for play that are currently they don't really have a lot of mechanical support just like advice and hand wave it seems like a hundred percent so what I'm trying to do is move away some of the DM Fiats some of the some of the hand wave IAM and actually give some codified procedures to game masters again that's a technical way of saying knowing when to roll dice knowing when to hand out inspiration things like that giving sort of if-then statements if the players do this then do that I think a good way to look at it too is also I don't want to just provide the game master with tools I want to provide the players with tools right my game takes place in a fairy tale setting and I want it to be all about whimsy fantastical characters etc I kind of wanted to move away from what I'd call fit traditional fantasy races dwarves elves etc and empower the characters to kind of explore self exploration almost like the Jim Henson Creature Workshop I'm gonna take a character I'm gonna describe their body type I'm gonna describe their eyes the quality of their voice I'm gonna describe the way they kind of move about the scene how they're dressed what kind of vibe do they project to the world as well as identify you know cultural Heritage's some things like that what do they do before their adventure all the mechanics of the original game are there I've also added on these additional layers really it's so you can do this self exploration really piece the kind of character that you want me so if you want to be a swashbuckling frog knight with a voice like honey you know you can be him you can be Salvatore of the Frog Knight so you kind of create your own character races create your own back but keeping it simple fast pithy and let the Claire's really enjoy that process no it seems to me when you're when you're kind of giving a framework for those descriptions that would lend itself to the people being more engaged because that you might actually hit a particular quirk or whatever that somebody else goes oh that's cool that's what's what I do are you just an observer of people how do you come to that like is it just the things that that pop whenever you're like in the world or when you're gaming as far as design goes what I did is a lot of research you know what are a hundred different ways to describe someone's personality okay and go through a lot of books and then start try try to pick out touchstones try to find these things that really resonate with people as well as have variety because it's very easy to do a stack of positive traits I have dark hair I wear glasses I wear camo death safe shirts it got nice manicured facial hair go to teaching the Taekwondo and Jonathan Pruitt but also you know you want to find that balance you know you also want to give the portly boy from Virginia with you know high cheekbones and a round face like a pie plate and scraggly blond hair yeah but you need to copyright those cheekbones you study people but you also do a lot of research as well as providing that vast variety so we want to make sure you cover all sorts of body types you know we play with a mutual friend TK Johnson and they wanted to play a character that was very large so they played a Gila monster inspired lizard oak in the land between two rivers what my framework does is it helps people that maybe aren't as descriptive like I'll be honest when I run a game I might not be the most descriptive but it tells players these really evocative words to describe their character likewise provide the mechanics to the game choosing your feet so to be or I should say features you know so if you're describing this kind of character who might be of a fairy folk descent you want to make sure that maybe they have magic or maybe they can teleport or maybe they have wings so you kind of choose from a menu to out of maybe 12 options it's like I want wings and I also want this sort of glamour weave ability where I get a pick either druid or sorcerer a first-level spell in two cam trips and you kind of build your character so that's kind of where we start from the player side where you kind of leave your own mythology at the table I like that because like fifth edition does have that sort of style of misses as much about character interactions as it is about the adventure that they're really trying to like get you to invest in your character right I see like the personality traits beliefs ideals of laws is a step in that direction but seems like you're taking it and putting more of the control in the players hansung like you'll really invest in what your character projects out there and then like supporting that with then it interfaces with these subsystems you're talking about yeah yes a hundred percent and I think it's really important that you mention those background details like the personality traits ideals bonds flaws because in my game system when you interface with those aspects of your character the system notifies the game master when they engage with their bond while interacting with say an enemy here's some options you can add to the enemy maybe you make them in a lead enemy maybe they're gonna do double damage than the typical enemy in this system likewise you know maybe they have the ability to summon a swarm but it lets you know as your character is engaged with the role-playing yeah and when I say roleplay I'm referring to the mechanics associated with the game itself not just playing for trained characters talking in character it's as they touch these aspects of their characters there's a reason it's on their character sheet I think that's really the best way to learn a playing game your character sheets kind of your interface with the game a lot of times when I teach systems I I feel a system of success with I touch every spot of the character sheet almost like a game of operation you know removing the bones it's like yeah yeah but that's that's sort of the way it works for me in terms like creating a character that has these mechanical hooks for them and then like having systems that support it is this something you're doing the like drive play to help diem sort of set up the world or a specific adventure or is it more there for like the players to get invested like where's the interaction I guess between diem and player getting that in investment that you're trying to encourage I think it's twofold you want the gamemaster to clearly articulate the structure of the game we're playing everyone we're playing a mystery we're gonna solve a mystery together I need everyone to buy into this in turn I need you to take actions that help solve the mystery you're gonna know the type of actions maybe you should take by looking at those background details and then the game's gonna reward you for participating in those actions if you try to solve the mystery then the game will reward you yeah you might not solve the mystery but you'll have a pretty good time attempting to a couple questions first off is this just gonna be only for 5e or can you use this in other systems I believe with a really good setting when you're designing settings could be used with other systems I'd like to have some stretch goals to expand to other core rule set such a cipher system it powered by the apocalypse we're working out those details I think a really good setting when you design I think it's a Wolfgang Bauer quote is don't just think about world building think about setting design and a good setting should stand on its own for any system I think I've run several dozen settings in you know an equal number of rules set just because I choose the rules for the type of game that I want to play what I'm hearing is there's a lot of taking those elements that right now just sort of rely on whatever the DM decides it's gonna happen or a simple die roll the universal kind of like alright roll your d 20 add your proficiency kind of thing and trying to complicate that offer the players more choices and more ways to interface and hopefully like that creates an environment where there's richer interaction with the game world and like Spurs everything you give us like concrete examples of what that might look like like something taken out of diems hands and putting in our procedure okay so taking something out of the dm's hands is the warden of inspiration yes for when people actually remember to reward it might save for when you run a combat scenario we're going to run combat this is a story about monster hunting and delving into dungeons that are dark and deep you're going to go into the deep places of the earth and then we will list five instances during this adventure structure where you would a reward inspiration when a player is willing to go into a location where they have no chance of seeing anything and it's colder than any place they've ever been and someone takes that leap of faith into the game world a ward a point of inspiration give them that mechanical incentive likewise when they're outnumbered in there against all odds the player that stamps their ground and calls the others to either flee for their lives while they hold while they delay the inevitable or leads the counter-assault a ward inspiration is someone for being a heroic leader you know a third example would be when someone steps in to defend maybe not a warding inspiration but maybe saying in these situations where a player stands up for another player character give them a bonus for their armor class give them a conditional modifier we have conditional modifiers it's like well they're acting valiant reward it and incentivize in the game likewise it also empowers the game master if players are not interacting with the game they're sandbagging the adventure they're bringing everyone else down maybe dole out a penalty it's kind of like hey just so you know the the game worlds not too happy with you right now and full disclosure there is a game master controlled character kind of like the rooster from Disney's Robin Hood that kind of goes in and out of the story or John Hurt yeah John Hurt from Disney our Jim Henson storyteller you know he's sometimes you say or sometime he's not it's like you know what ork you from Star Trek yeah that's cute you're sorry there I'm gonna change the rules of the universe for you because you have the opportunity to tell great stories I is a Game Master character they are there the storyteller they're the narrator the narrow door they live off of stories and when someone just kind of sandbags really they probably won't even have a name in the book you know they'd be out of focus in the background we want to encourage people to be the stars of their story be the main character so this sort of GM PC is not like it's not like the the DM from the DMV cartoon rather a physical know it's like that yeah okay that it is that I for a minute it sounded like it's more the DMM PC is like a force in the world that kind of acts against it but I also like them being a person that I could talk to it's both so there are there's our influence throughout the world and we have you know tables in the game it's like you know roll roll the die you know if you hear the howl of the wolf you know that roost on crimson snow is influencing the story and you you have these little cues these little sensory perceptions you know you hear something you smell something you see something that Clues you in the the narrator the GM controlled character is influencing the game or they just might show up they can hear it now there's a lot of people GMP see it's over power you're you're like you know you're inserting yourself into the game players agency is gonna be taken away anything you have to like alleviate some of like concerns for that because I really like this idea I love the idea of being a force in this setting it seems like a few halo right it's a very nuanced way to have a corrective measure in place that you're you're taking the guesswork out danger of of how to how to correct these behaviors check out our episode on problem but how when you want to store the mechanics for that let's look at the framework you already have a a dungeon master game master running the game already is omnipotent and already has no scope this actually reduces that scope right it rather than do anything on your own whim you're giving clear set instructions and these are instructions that players can learn from you actually want to encourage player agency and you want to be a fan of the players you want them to make creative choices and what you're doing is you're helping them understand from the palette of infinite choices reducing back some of that and affording them very clear-cut options yeah choose you know good better or best you'll get rewarded for all of them but also choose the one that your character would choose likewise you know it is kind of a a push back to have a a meta character in the world yeah but also it clearly lets the players know when they're either crossing lines or when they should push those lines maybe they should break those boundaries maybe that's what the game master character once maybe he really wants them to take control of their own destinies and forge their own path in what it does is it simply incentivizes in codifies player rewards so and if you're playing the Grand Ellis drinking game where every time you says the word codify is you take a shot there's probably about nine or so shots into this episode yeah essentially what we want to do is we want to give structure we want to give clear-cut rules while still letting players know sometimes you're just gonna have to use your best judgment so you say like clear-cut rules structures for a lot of players out there a lot of tables and and myself included we're looking at role playing in that interaction and then like why players make certain choices and a lot of that's just internal we don't it's not interfaced with the game rules at all and it seems to kind of work players seem to find goals that they want to pursue there's investment in the world so like what's the benefit of having something that's clear-cut structured as opposed to the more freeform style that I think a lot of tables are used to well the first thing I would say that it allows you to frame your scenes in your game you'll know when a scene has a beginning middle and an end likewise it will empower you to be a more precise storyteller when you're making decisions about what to include in your game the system will help you figure out what to cut out that is to say you don't want to remove the improvisational fun you just don't want to empower the improvisational tool by restricting it slightly as well as giving more toys to play with at the table I think any table that's having a lot of fun playing RPGs already what this might do is just prompt additional ideas yeah well I was gonna say good improv still needs prompts you still draw you have the you have the touchstones to start from and then you do you let your mind blossom from their game structures for me particularly wrinkles like adjudicating social interactions or just how the world works around the the players it's like it's helpful when they're DM facing some example of this for me would be like I prefer something that lets me roll a reaction to an NPC as opposed to something a player roles like a persuasion or a charm or something like that I'd like tell me what you got to say whether it's in person third person whatever but or in character they're out of character usually I'll be the one to inter interface with the the rules are is that sort of similar with this the players interfacing with a lot of new rules themselves I wouldn't necessarily say they're interfacing with new rules but what they might do is they might approach the rules differently for example this seeks to solve the problems about when and how to award experience sure you will know very clearly when you level in the system because you're playing through as stories similar to games like invisible son by Monte cook games where you are traveling through an arc and as you travel through the arc together you're building a story together as you progress through this as a group of players you're going to gain that experience you're going to gain levels you're gonna unlock new abilities and it sort of removes what I'll call the old the old black belt method from my jujitsu training you get the belt advancement when I feel that you have earned it that was the sort of the Brazilian Jujitsu it's I when I know you've earned it that's what I'm gonna give it you there was no testing system it a lot of fiat did you find some of that in sort of what I'll call loose milestones in fifth edition so this this really just Clues you in and so if you're lacking confidence and maybe win and how to make a decision that says if your players have done this this this and this you know they've qualified themselves on four different levels now advance them and if they haven't you have a game master character to prompt them in a direction to push towards either conclusion of the narrative or to explore a story beat that has been left and you can still give them options rather than restrict them and railroad them you might say you know there are four villages you have not yet visited on this trail each of them would love to meet your characters right choose one yeah and they say camp here I'll just bring on some monsters and have a big fight no III but I really I really like that because it's a way of like codifying things I find that when I rely on Fiat I get in ruts and I that's when my unconscious bias kicks in and that's when I find myself like thinking about my games after the fact and going like man I I in hindsight would have made a different decision or what a but you know adjudicated that differently or something and so like the game structures give you a way to kind of bypass a lot of that the downfalls of dmy it and I find from player side it gives me a sense of the world as an independent place that's not just did the DM eat lunch this this week you know where they just cranky or angry and like that's why they're saying no if you've not played with them and a lot of modern games the these sort of game structures are less prevalent than they were earlier games it can seem weird it can seem artificial or seem like you're getting in the way of a kind of naturalistic improv style and I find them very empowering I find them very like we're going to give you the tools to have a more satisfying game experience oh I totally agree and at Grant you can back me up here when we were running when you were running invisible Sun on our channel and I first had my character I had to expansive of an arc from the beginning and I didn't know what to do because I didn't understand it's like no incremental steps don't don't make your arc the big final thing you okay I need to gather these materials I need to prep these materials I need to you know those are your arts and like once it that happened it was a completely different experience yeah I mean I don't know I'm just backing you up there on the empowering part you know you definitely know and it's one of those things too it's a framework that provides you know you're gonna have that see plot it's there's the final event that we're working to the climax followed by the day Noma but I'm gonna have my personal individual arc as well as we're gonna have some goals as a team and a group of adventurers that are going on stories here in this sort of it's a dark fairy tale world if you're going to things like Jim Henson's start crystal or the storyteller labyrinth you know it kind of has that curious girl in a magical world you know feel I love that idea because so many fairy tales are good stories are that lost adventure in a strange new land like you can you can make that broad assumption about a lot of stories and because no that's kind of how everybody feels you know it's literally like when you're having new experiences you feel lost and like this gives you a kind of a framework on trying that out and being used to those feelings so that it kind of help you in life because not to get all whatever about it but that think that's one reason why we play these role-playing games so like we're talking about invisible side way to going and we've got these invisible son has these structures where like it's the first game I saw where the method of advancement was put in the players hands for like how they choose I'm gonna buy an ark which will generate xp for me and it will give me a benchmarks that I need to hit how I hit those benchmarks what they look like is all up to me and and the referee is gonna like find a way to craft a satisfying encounter out of that everything but it was a I thought it was really interesting because up until that point I was like how would you introduce these kind of things without it being railroad II without like having a predetermined in that you're working towards and in this style it's just it gives you an arc go discover this thing go you know establish a romance or found an organization or seek revenge or any another number of things you can do and like experiencing it as a player like cemented the idea that giving me any mechanical incentive that combines with like the narrative elements of the game is I don't you won't need to provide hooks I'll I'll bring my own goals and everything so there's like that's sort of the thing you're trying to capture and and get to yes really I think what it is is we interface with these mechanics and we play the game we have fun at the table we have this experience of portraying these characters and playing these roles and the whimsical fantasy setting but those mechanics start to create emotions in us and we start to feel these certain feelings such as accomplishment or guilt because you know maybe maybe I broke someone's heart maybe my character wasn't ready for a romance I had to I had to take off and I had to leave town because the Sun was setting and my night travels with the rotation of the earth you know he has a wanderer and I feel those feelings and then I talk with my friends about those feelings and that's where the story comes from that's where you start telling story so I get to use my creativity as a player and the game provides me with these feelings that I share with other people and I think that's the big the big distinction there like the story is the retelling of it after the fact you're experiencing something while it's going on the game itself is like this experience of play and then the story comes in afterwards and I think that was like always present with role-playing games and it was always like a feature of it but it's you also have to trust and I think there's a lot of difficulty for some people because they want they want something they want a specific experience they want a certain type of engagement and I in my opinion they sort of put the cart before the horse instead of creating the conditions for this that are like artificially induce the engagement the investment well yeah I right there with you because I was formulating my question here which was you know those people that create those elaborate backstories for their care oh sure yeah but this is actually giving them an avenue to be like oh you have this thing that you want to be well now let's bring some arcs in so you can actually do that and it's part of the game as opposed to sometimes people can see it as like a distraction from the plot because the the GM has their thing yeah and now it can be a thing where you're all coming together and helping each other this dance this is true collaborative storytelling because a feature of the game is you have a book a collection of the tales and as you play through an arc together you talk about this is where we journeyed this is what we did how did we all feel about that experience and then we write down both our characters and ourselves so at the end of the campaign you as a play a collection of players have written the story of your campaign together very powerful all you got to do is publish write kickstart first right III get that being a really great session recap tool I was sort of like okay guys remember a lot put yourself in the mindset of last week remember where your you were personally as a player remember where your character was let's recap and I can see it or even like you know you in the middle of the week on a disc or channels for like filling it in and then you read back over it at the start and keeping that continuity of like motivations and and intent it's it's such a powerful way to build up strong connections between the characters in the world I'm excited to see sort of the tools that will be available for boredom and I think we can you hit on something as well when we talk about the overarching plot or end points or a real tight structure I think we noticed also with these role-playing games particularly in the system that I'm developing that we we sort of see technical term orthogonal loop essentially player creativity going towards a player specified goal as opposed to a story goal so the story has an endpoint you might you know you probably play Skyrim and you put hundreds of hours into building the perfect house or having the perfect romance or running a shop sure the game is best armor so so by 18th level yeah the game the game has it's a story in but you can create your own story and you by setting your own goal and you just find yourself playing the game creating your own style of play getting your own enjoyment from it systems that give you those tool to create that sort of enjoyment are very powerful for the players yeah what I like about that what you're saying is basically this game that the character is playing it isn't the book of this character it's just a chapter in their life or it could be a section in their life but it they get to decide how how that continues they like in terms of you know players having goals and and sort of bringing those goals and intending they're gonna drive to the game any kind of structures that you're providing like sample scenarios or something for people to kind like plug their own ideas into or something or where does your head head out on that one it's a setting book to so obviously there's continents locations adventure hooks since we talked about different types of stories so if you look at say the village of Fairbrook Fairbrook has a number of different story types that you can just actively go into this person's looking for a romance this person wants to make sure that we've repelled the invading fell beyonders or nightmare creatures whatever have you but likewise there might be a location called your cousin's house talk with the players one of you has a cousin who lives here who's it yeah let's describe your cousin and your cousin is going to have a situation that needs to be resolved likewise you you want to empower the game master as well as the players to create and invent their own scenarios if someone has a very large family talk about how you can use those fictional elements in the story yeah I really like that because like one of my favorite you know products for just D&D is you and soon and it has tons of tables for like here's the social club your characters belong to this is the patrons at the tea house and you know here's what they you know the local magistrate might want you to do in the jungle it's and it's like you can create these elements on the fly use the preset ones and I personally I find those kind of setups very satisfying you make your own and can tailor it to you know your group give you the tools you need for that it also has slug overlords it also has look yeah there's that I bought the book and read it on your recommendations what it's sounding like is that there's a almost like there's a proceeded sandbox playground kind of thing above you can go here you're gonna need to here's how you fill in the details for the characters like if the players want to do something you can tell them oh well the adventures out there these people here like you were saying need help they would love to meet you they would love to have a hero stop by and in that sense he it provides an incentive to get out there an adventure yeah and you you also begin every arc with a really strong framework where you let them know you know if you begin it once upon a time or a long time ago or and so it was and you start the prompt and it always begins the narrator reveals that they're going to be wearing a certain particular mask we're going to have a story of places darkened em in monsters that need to be slain and then you sort of give this is the initial conflict that's going on we need adventures just all solve it and the story begins in a location maybe in the middle of things you're on the way to it so that you can resolve the story and start progressing towards an arc you don't necessarily want players to be wandering aimlessly and a lot of it too might seem like this is strange I'm not too sure where to go I'm not too sure what to do you want to give them a strong seed and these are you know fairy tales are some of the oldest stories we have as human beings there are thousands of years old every culture has them so I think they resonate with a very wide audience of all ages certainly it sounds like you know there are a wide variety of ways to engage with it because like some of those fairy tales are you know it's about outsmarting something in others it's about you know physical prowess or something it's the mythic kind of the coupling of fantastic and mundane and embedding it in a world coupled with like the mechanical support to me he promises like a new way to engage with the fifth edition ruleset because now we're we're doing more with this basic and a fairy tale generally has a lesson to be learned oh sure right yeah so I assume that's a part of it as well yeah there's a very powerful quote by Neil Gaiman he attributes it to GK Chesterton and he says fairy tales are more than true not because they teach us that dragons exist but because they teach us that Dragons can be beaten yeah and I want my players to feel that they can beat dragons in their own lives they can play through any sort of story type IRL in real life and they can get through that and I want the game to empower them to feel confident in their regular lives whether it's a mechanic or whether it's like a place in the in the setting itself or maybe a character what's your favorite little thing like your what's your what's your favorite son or daughter or whatever so to speak that you can't wait for players to interact with well first I want every player to go through the character creation process and to discover their fairytale character in mine who I created who will is available as a sample character you can see exactly how I built them and you can make your own if you go on our site there'll be a link below is Salvatore the Frog Knight yes Frog King his people come from the swamp he has bulging eyes but he has a very you know sonorous voice he is known for being very valiant and courageous and these are things I picked that he stout he's not very tall but he moves very well he is a sword master he has the ability to summon a familiar that he calls his squire you can also cast a couple can trips the cannibal companionship etc ease and he has his good Squire and we is a wandering Knight who speaks in a poetic language you know I'm just choosing things from a list in people look to him as if he'd be a good leader but he cannot stay if or he has a cause to go through and he travels on his trusty mount and he travels with his party wielding of zweihander you know in he's he's just a very evocative character who I love because when I was thinking about what kind of game do I want to make I said I want you to be the Frog Prince yeah I don't want you to have to listen to the story of the Frog Prince I to empower you to be that character going on a noble quest you're gonna get some smooches just trying to get some smooches he's proud of his Frog heritage I really like the the framing device in us were like once upon a time or something it comedic I've suggest bite-sized sort of chunks of a campaign where it's like we're gonna we're gonna tell this discreet story we don't know how it's gonna end we don't know what's gonna happen but we've got these structures that will shape the game in a certain way and like a framing device for it because I love sandbox I love just like here's a town and you can go some rumors and get in trouble but having a strong like something that propels the game something that gives it you know themes to be about I really like those because so often when I've tried to do them or experience them from the players side it's just kinda like oh I want this game to be about X I want it to be about the tension between whatever or this theme and then that's that's it we don't there's nothing to reinforce it there's no mechanics or anything so it's always a missed opportunity I think well kind of piggybacking on that point Jim seeing is how you've kind of merged storytelling and mechanics together which a lot of people see is maybe like conflicting at the table like worrying about mechanics versus story what are some of the pitfalls when trying to design that you know to make it like playable anytime you're in a group dynamic can you give that much narrative control to the entire table you have to be very careful how you use that herding cats yeah you're hurting cats maybe you don't trust each other maybe you have conflicting goals I think it's very good the mechanics there's a conversation that you end up having with the game and letting everyone have a little bit of buying creates a lot of investment so I think the biggest pitfalls that you're looking for to avoid is definitely I'd really say the conflict between players you want everyone to sort of accept I think by not having a preconceived notion about what the ending of the story is or really sharp structure getting everyone to buy in that we're all gonna have a little bit of narrative control and we all have choice and agency about how and when we use it is how you sort of navigate and avoid that and then if you all end up falling down the pit then nice thing is there's excellent stories that happen at the bottom of a pit and that's how Luke killed the rancor after all that is very true so basically if you have a player show it with basically a Skeksis just stay on there and then someone else shows up with basically a gelfling you might have to massage that situation a little bit because technically they're their goals are gonna be in direct conflict with one another right their goals their personal goals might be in direct conflict with each other but their end goal in the story goal might be the same we won't go too deep and dark crystal or but they used to be joined with the Mystics they used to be joined and you know you used to have these er sects and there's a reason why the Skeksis form and it might be that you want to portray something I'll say since you're allowed to essentially create your own fantasy race in the game you're allowed to create your heritage and declare your own heritage you don't necessarily walk in with what I'd call the Skeksis stereotype yeah we need to talk spoilers later because there's a huge there's a huge continuity hole that was developed I'm sorry there is it's there I watched I've watched the series three times now and we'll talk about it later it's got a map I can't return to the topic of like role playing mechanics mechanics is encouraged or gamify the role-playing experience and that tension between the I don't need dice to do this just talk in character or tell me what your character says and we'll use common sense and sort of like quick heuristics to determine what what happens I'm sympathetic to that view because that's kind of how I run mine I look at that boom right there we roleplay and then I use like the players that persuasion role as my reaction or you know using those tables in the dmg and I hope for a minimalist you know mechanics in that regard and I think I'm just interested in like what are all the permutations and combinations and things to consider and just it seems like adding mechanics to these kind of interactions seems to give people like pause but at the same time it's valuable and adds something and I don't know I think it's important to discuss the type of mechanics that you add too because a randomness mechanic of a die roll is very different than like say a narrative control mechanic where I hand you a token and say this is my player intrusion I want this to be the castle where my father was the knight general okay the different different mechanics so I think what you want to do is mitigate the randomness and what you want to do is just give tools that people can have to use as these storytelling tools I think a lot of it can be handled as the calm as a conversation and an informal conversation we've had examples at your table where players had very specific goals and I had specific goals they came in a conflict with each other and I called a timeout and talked with players my character would be looking for your character yeah do you want to be found yeah no yeah I'm still gonna find you but after you've done everything that you want to do if it's okay with Jim you know and I think you just sort of have a conversation like that a lot of this and and it's worth reiterating is about comfort with the players are playing with was about like comfort with the game and and the sense of feeling empowered to stop the game and have two players have a conversation between themselves are you good with what we're about to do yes under these conditions diem is this alright and like that's the thing I see more and more of as I play in the longer I play and I just think like and I wish we were doing that you know 10 15 years ago because I think there's a lure of the the immersion to the extent that you forget you're playing a game we want to forget about all this stuff going on here and like live in the characters heads and I think that's great go for it but like taking a step back and going no I want this for my character example for me it's like it when I play you know warrior types I try not to do anything that's gonna pigeonhole me with a certain weapon I want to I want to play games where I use a different weapon every time I play or I lose all of my gear and have to you know currently playing a ranger and is like I had urban herbalism kit that was it in walking through the forest and trying to survive and to me it's like I think it touches on those orthogonal play goals you're talking about but also like letting letting players see what drives them see what motivates them and then getting out of their way it seems like you're really trying to give people mechanics that empower the players but the mechanics don't overpower the players yeah to where you can you can play and be immersive but you're not constantly thinking well I but I need to do this so I can get advantage on blah blah blah and you can think about it in a more naturalistic way and here's I think a really good incentive when you think about the mechanics - these are mechanics that reveal secrets of the world to the players so it will take an example from you you want to play a very specific warrior type and you want to be the warrior that loses everything and only has an herbalism kit in this type of game you know a game master might say Jim the gods are going to reveal themselves to your character if he can swear off weapons for three sessions that's a hard thing for that character to do and you think about it you're they're gonna put the temptation there they're gonna create the tension it might be a point where your warrior is the only person that can defend the village and there's a sword and a stone right there there's a sword in the stone you'll be there keenness but it might be that the gods are just testing his determination to meet with them and it might be when he meets with them but the gods give him you know like his trademark weapon that he becomes known for throughout all time he becomes the object of the bards sing about I want mechanical structures that give that kind of incentive to where it's like this is what the people write the stories about you're giving the the players the tools to form you their own goals and then like for one I like the DM the sword the DM logica give them the moon and make them or give them the Sun and make them work for the moon giving them something that says you know you can make an impact on this world you can find something you can create something for your character to interface with and currently you just gotta wait for the DM to have a sense that yeah this is the castle where the dad should be imprisoned this is the village where the gods are going to test our you know the faith or or whatever of this you know this woodsman having something where you can just sort of roll some dice or pick from a menu and follow a procedure that's how you train dm's to be able to do this without all of that internalize it and start doing this in their own games and it feels like something new and some way to take fifth edition that's different yeah I think what it does is it kicks a lot of adventure back into it when I say kicks a lot of adventure you know it's gonna breathe some fresh air it's gonna give people ideas of different character avenues that maybe they haven't explored with their table it might also help them figure out maybe they want to create their tastes maybe they haven't had the opportunity to do an expedition style adventure where they're marching across a continent maybe they haven't had the opportunity to have a player that's they're afraid to draw their sword and they haven't explored those emotions yeah likewise they might not have had the opportunity to defeat the villain or avenge their family and be rewarded for it yeah yeah all those things that like when we were coming up playing D&D they were in the backstories there were things we talked about when we were just like imagining what our games would be like but when we would sit down to play because at least for me I'm still following that I was following that old model of now this is my campaign I got a story to tell I've got I know where I want it to end and we'll kind of work our way massage our way there but we rarely got there it almost always ended up with some kind of argument or conflict or more often than not something like that because players are frustrated they're not getting what they want out of it diems frustrated because they're not invested in it and a lot of ways it's like if there were structures and in communication to go alongside it you could have those kinds of experiences roleplay eat it - you certainly can't and my experience with visible invisible son and the narrative control mechanics from cipher both you're
