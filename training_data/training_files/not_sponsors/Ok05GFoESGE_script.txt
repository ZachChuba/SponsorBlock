hi last time I told you to leave your deep questions and thoughts in my subreddit and there I can sort them easily by the number of votes and go through them and answer them for you but before we get into it there is a quick note thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video and helping share knowledge more about them later in the video that was the note anyway this is a brand new type of show that's never been tried before where I will review your submissions in reddit I wonder what I should call this show last time I told you that City sounds French how about Latta t yeah sounds good roll the intro [Music] [Music] the next episode of anyway go ahead and still I keep saying stuff like but I think the copyright of slap like is taken by Davi 504 I should come up with my own how about I say peasant like oh it's a mixture of Farsi and English like English present means hit like means like and always a party thing so unlike all and let's start reviewing your stuff here is this maybe send me interesting things people means out of it I hope you didn't do that I was looking for your deepest thoughts and questions me waiting for a new video come on do something yeah I know I'm not submitting very often but what can I do my team is already busy with all the complicated videos I'm trying to make you know what get me to four million subscribers quickly and I'll reveal to you my entire team that's working on my videos what is this one hmm with yeah with yeah I have blown up a hotel in London before US government know your location hello there is only one problem why is that screw in the wall has a live voltage on it oh I know I've done this before once I was trying to install some cabinets on the wall I used the drill to drill into the concrete and then there was an explosion right in my face I drilled right into the conduit oh the hell am I supposed to know where they ran the wire in the wall well actually one good way is to use this live wire detection devices that when you bring it too close to live wire it starts beeping you can run these over the wall and if there is a live wire too close to the surface this will beep and you'll know and you wouldn't accidentally drill into it me during quarantine to allocute finally inner peace when that loud kid finally trips and breaks his spine good come on that's cruel yeah this is big brain time therapist big brain med it is spelled mvh di okay why does everyone spell it like that big brain MIDI isn't real he can't hurt you big brain marry anything that's not I mean every episode we like so how high was this voltage you just received Mary yes hi maybe can you explain this thing I found on telegram hey finally a question why AC current passes through capacitor what is this only nine upwards whatever let's take a look I'm not gonna watch the whole thing what is he doing I think a power outlets well tell me he's not going to plug his phone into live wires two coils and the prongs and now he's hot gluing it on a magnet a piece of coil oh just saw the title this is supposed to give him free internet working hundred percent why people do this stop making fake videos these videos get so many views for no reason I hope their channels explode MIDI review memes from this subreddit it would be fun could marry do this let's see yeah I've seen this before I think they somehow trap a huge amount of electricity in some sort of acrylic or something might be fun to try to make it okay I'll add it to my list help I want to make a blinker circuit I have and to n22 to transistor so I'm setting with what that but every video I saw on YouTube my LED just stays on and never flashes fine I'll just search it for you think of fluid no blinker circuit there this is exactly the circuit you want it's called a what I call a bi-stable resonator if I'm not wrong Maddy hey they spelled my name right do you have any hamsters what's this hamsters charging a phone well I think it's big the reason I say that is that a cell phone requires around two Anna have to fight watts of power to charge and that creates a large resistance for that thing to turn so this little guy would have hard time turning that thing but seeing that thing is turning freely almost it seems fake it is fake what a narc the guy is cutting the power line interestingly enough when it's still live why would it do that look at his face oh man that look on his face though what's wrong with the look on my face it's just a look of joy someone had to do this oh thanks for the hug electro boom as polandball what is that Lambo that's an Iranian ball what is it hey that's my homemade taser simulates a human Hey that was funny thanks for making it mr. lien Ingrid general I remember there's a specific flavor you can add your posts like faff rectify and probably if I click on that everything related to dad will pop up let's do that unfortunately I can sort them based on number of votes so I have to just browse through them and find the best ones found these spark plugs absorbing magnetic fields the hell is this spark plug free energy generator spark plug free energy generator with homemade free energy generator using spark plug activity new electric electric 2019 free energy generator 100% running with spark plug free energy generator using spark plug make electric free energy using magnet with spark plugs science for 2019 new for 2019 free energy generator using spark plug what's up with spark plugs they used to put some effort into making these fake videos so they actually looked a little bit more plausible than this spark plug is just to conduct tours close to each other that if the voltage is high enough and arc jumps between them all it does is that it converts most of the energy in heat that's why they use it in cars to ignite the fumes how's that supposed to generate any kind of energy by moving a man around it or whatever these free energy people are just getting lazy just preach together expecting it to work and people are expected to believe it and the sad part is there's a whole lot of people that believe it there's another free energy one seat this guy has put some good air for thing - making a fake device it looks clean it has magnets and coils it has a magnet pushing another magnet and a motor that generates power at least if you are making fake learn from this guy put some more effort to make it more believable what is spark gap doesn't do anything and don't make fake videos it's not nice to lure people home make free energy radio receiver how the hell is this possible it needs to be rectified please it's puzzling my mind well actually this is the free energy it's funny like 30 years ago my grandfather told me how to make this thing it's old technology it is basically an AM receiver that absorbs the very weak AM transmission radio frequencies and makes it into very weak audio signals you can hear from a crystal earphone it's an interesting project you can actually try to make it yourself okay what is this rectify this everyone this is a serious case we if this is true we can program our light as a Wi-Fi and literal make our phone catch signal with it well right off the bat the thumbnail is fake it says 150 gigabit per second between that stupid LED and the solar cell that's clickbait the circuit at best can do a few kilohertz but let's look at the project and see if it works so he has a solar cell connects it to some amplifier circuit and a speaker and then the whole thing runs on some DC and this setup acts as a receiver and then on the transmitter side he has some LEDs connects them to some audio jack wires and then some 9-volt batteries series with it so I assume the battery turns on the LEDs and the audio signal voltage modulates the light output logs the audio jack in play some music and the music is transferred from the LEDs to the solar cell and plays on the speaker now this is plausible but there are some things in the video that make it a little bit fake like for example how the audio level is not affected by the distance of the LEDs and the solar cell the further it is the light signals must be smaller and so the audio of it should drop but it doesn't and the other one is this see when he puts his hand in a speaker goes all the way down and all the way up which doesn't mean the speaker wouldn't play just that it means there is a big DC voltage across the speaker that's affected by the light input so it's not fake but it wouldn't run on 150 gigabit per second something I can try and make actually well he used two LEDs but I'm gonna use one LED I think it's enough for the proof-of-concept and I'm gonna put a resistor series with it to limit the current going into my phone audio jack I don't want to blow my phone so here's the transmitter power supply audio jack LED and resistor all in series and here's my solar panel connected to my scope of course it generates massive DC voltage and the AC could be very small compared to it so we have to get rid of DC first there you go and there's also a large AC voltage outputting from the solar cell which is from the lights in the room which means we will have to turn off our lights or we will hear a massive humming noise on our audio something they were not hearing in their video anyway here's my LED and I hold my solar panel in front of it and play something on my phone and see if we see anything on this scope and look at that it's the audio signals the solar cell is actually picking it okay let's see if we can play it or record it okay I'm gonna use my audio amplifier I made in my other video and plug my solar panel to it to amplify and feed output to my camera to record and you shall not be yeah so it definitely works although you need a much better circuit and the ambient light greatly affects the output and the distance between the LED and solar panel greatly affects the audio level something I didn't see in that video okay next one can you please rectify this video so you can shut up my mom who doesn't know a thing about electromagnetism and won't shut up about how 5g is bad for us well my last video was about 5g show that to your mom title translates to if mobile networks are safe then how are they making the popcorn pop I have seen these videos before let's look at them they put a bunch of popcorn kernels on the table put their phones around it and everyone calls those phones so in theory the energy from all the transmissions from the cell phones is high enough to pop the popcorn so much energy well it's definitely faith don't you think if the energy was high enough to pop a popcorn you wouldn't feel it in your brain when you are calling someone this is definitely some video editing stuff a job for Captain disillusion but let's search and see if we can find out how they did it Auto popcorn it's a cell phone set the scene on popped kernels cell phones of various makes and models giggling teenagers that's an essential component air pop a few popcorn kernels on your stove while filming drop the popped kernels onto the table from above digitally erase the unpopped kernels from the footage and add sound effects that's how you do it what is this one rectified this okay this is my homemade my maximum voltage ionizer no telling actually drill a hole into the side of microwave oven so he actually drilled the hole on the side of his microwave oven and all the radiations that are supposed to stay inside or shooting out of his horn antenna you realize how dangerous that is it could burn the [ __ ] out of you easily see what happens let's turn it on let's what happens oh the energy coming out of the microwave he's actually lighting a fluorescent lightbulb all the way back there so dangerous do you hear those buzzing x' on the video it's all the radio waves hitting his camera making noise on the audio and hitting his own body too so he could be getting warm not annoying it and he put a light right against the metal fridge which means all the waves are reflecting from it into the room and it's quite dangerous don't do it I should find a way to do it safely later I think that's good enough for one day thanks a lot for your submissions I think we learned a few things here and there well if you still like me to review your stuff then like all and submit better stuff meme or science so we can learn more and if you really want to learn so join now and as always thanks for watching
