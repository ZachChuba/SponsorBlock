yo mama is so fat if we convert her weight to megabytes she weighs almost as much as newreddit.com or at least that is what we're going to test out today in my last video i mentioned how javascript can be used with client-side routing to avoid downloading an entire html page every time you navigate to a part of a website and the idea is if you go to a lot of different pages on a website this can actually be more efficient and so here's the thing new reddit uses that technique but it is kind of trash and so what i wanted to do in this video is from a technical perspective look at it and see is it as bad as what people say because there's two big complaints i hear about it number one the design is just disgusting there's not much i can do about that but the second one is is just slow and bloated so i want to see how slow how bloated is new reddit alright so i got incognito up and i think i'm gonna do everything in here that way i don't have any browser extensions that change anything and i'm just going to right click inspect to open up dev tools and i'm going to head over to the network tab so this whenever we load a page we'll be able to see everything and see how much is loading and how long it takes so now i'm going to head on over to newreddit.com for the third time in my life um new reddit well this is not a good start 503 first bite timeout okay this is really not a good start okay sweet so red.com load for me i'm not sure why new reddit wasn't working but we'll just use this since this uses new reddit anyway and so my network tab here i can see all the different requests that happened when i loaded this page and i can see all the pictures the javascript all that fun stuff and so on the bottom left here i can see that a total of 245 requests happened to load everything for this page and then 12.2 megabytes was transferred and then 17.7 megabytes of resources was loaded huh i actually don't know what the difference between these two things are alright snack overflow to the rescue transferred is the compressed size of the resources you can think of this as the amount of upload and download data that a mobile user will use in order to load the page and resources is uncompressed size of all the resources okay so one of them is just the gzipped value and the other size is the total size okay then what i'll do is i'll just keep track of the transferred and ignore the resources because transfer is what's actually going to be loaded across the internet or whatnot and then the last part here is the load time so what i did is i just right clicked and i did empty cache and hard reload and it took 20.66 seconds with nothing cached like what is it loading on this page that has it transferring 12.2 megabytes the first thing is an mp4 file mp4 mp4 and if we just click on this and we right click copy link address okay yeah it's just a video playing okay so that's just the content of the website if i just filter by mp4s 5.9 megabytes is videos so the first question is why is new reddit loading so many videos of this size and old red is not also one thing i just saw all the top requests are videos and then there's a random png first off how is this png moving i didn't think pngs could move what the heck is this why is this not a gif that's weird so they have a png that is moving that is 1.1 megabytes okay so the first thing that i notice about old reddit is they're not loading any mp4 files initially and i guess it's not until i actually like click on one of these and now it starts loading these yep okay so they lazy load the videos until you actually want to see it old red still loads a hunk javascript for their video player like that's bigger than the actual page so old red.com is here it's 144 kilobytes but the javascript for the radio player is 157 and they were somehow able to figure out how to make a small png rocket that's moving but new reddit just increased the size of their their moving emoji png things by like tenfold for some reason what i'm trying now is loading a subreddit that doesn't have any videos so we can just ignore that easily and so i loaded programming humor and new red does a lot better only has four megabytes that it loads and if we go to old reddit it is close to one megabyte and if i just scroll up to see what the biggest thing that's being loaded here i can see again on new red it's just because they're loading the images of the actual posts or at least the top two are so like when i scroll this i actually see images but when i scroll old reddit i don't unless i press this you know to load it like that but they have javascript for what looks like governance chat governance chat governance and some of it also looks like it is for ads so i just turned on u-block origin that way it just takes ads out of the equation and new reddit improved by a tiny bit it's now at 3.7 megabytes and old reddit improved a little bit as well it is now closer to 700 kilobytes what i want to do now is just take the images out of the equation that are associated with the posts and just compare the javascript the css and the html and then maybe any json that new reddit loads i just realized i can just command click these and i can just keep these four tabs open and then we're good then i don't have to spreadsheet so i'm just gonna do that so it's gonna filter these four resources just like that and we can see it's 1.5 megabytes and we're just going to head on over to top now wait a second 13.1 000 members that's absolutely nothing what the heck am i even doing here i'm on the totally wrong subreddit and you guys didn't even say anything you're just like i'm not gonna let them know and uh here we are okay so i'm actually on the right subreddit now but i'm also seeing that it loads mp4s so what i think i might do is just like right click and block the request domain it's at 1.9 megabytes now that looks good so let's go back to top now of the day and we'll just click on some posts so i'm going to clear and comments and how much are we loading 500 kilobytes and what are we loading so the comments of the page was 161 a sidebar ad how am i getting a sidebar ad i literally have incognito on oh this is a native ad that reddit has so it's actually coming from reddit's api okay they're loading the json for the ad interesting and it's got a gql request so using some graphql edges that looks like relay to me nice ad post we got there okay these are just the subreddit posts okay so it does a gql request to load 27 posts that's weird so what i did is i clicked on the comments to load this post and it loaded all the posts like 27 posts i'm going to go to the next post 160 144 let's go to c plus oh this one's a little bit more i'm back on old reddit i load the top posts and we're going to click on comments and we're going to see what happens so that was 165 kilobytes dang why is old red just so good 183 and what is the majority of this so it looks like yeah it's literally just loading the entire pages html and it just serves that and that's just it's good just the way you should be doing it what i think is killing new reddit right now is this request that they load sidebar ads and the sidebar ad post thing that they're loading is 90 kilobytes and it's bigger than all the other requests after it loads the initial js that needs to load i think i might try just blocking the request url but it only blocked the ads domain and the comments still showed up and only 35 kilobytes was loaded for this this post so see the content of the post is actually not that heavy it's this extra junk that new reddit loads in that messes things up i just reloaded the page and now what i want to see is if i just go through and i click a bunch of different posts on new reddit how much data is accumulated over all those page loads so i just have it up open here on the right and the initial load took 1.8 megabytes for this page and we're just gonna see as i click on these things go to the next one two three four five six seven eight nine ten the total amount of data that loaded for me clicking on those ten posts or at least clicking on the comments for those 10 posts was 2.4 megabytes so you can see like at first it loads a big hunk and then it loads a little bit more js when i click on the first comments of the post above but then after that it's just making a json request to get the data for the comments and for the post and it's not that heavy after that now i'm gonna do the same thing on old reddit and so i just refresh the page we're sitting at 221 kilobytes let's go so first post second post third post fourth post fifth post and you can immediately see as we're doing this if you're looking at the kbs over there that uh it is just adding up faster than when we did the js version or the new reddit version so we're at 1.3 megabytes this is what post six but zero base so this is actually post seven so this is post eight post nine and post ten so the grand total for old reddit is 1.6 megabytes so it actually did catch up quite a bit to new reddit but it still beats it by a decent amount because new red is sitting over here at 2.4 megabytes but i think it's pretty safe to say that it's possible at maybe like 20 25 posts if we load that many that it's possible for new red to actually be more efficient than old reddit assuming we cut out all the crap that we did with new reddit i'm way too lazy to actually test this out though and click 20 30 posts clicking on 10 posts was already a struggle so we're just going to leave this up to a mystery because i think for the most part i got what i wanted out of this exercise the main takeaway for me is that new red is just a hot mess and i think it has less to do with the text stack that they picked and more so with they just seem to be loading a ton of content up front that you may or may not use whereas old reddit seems to wait and lazy load that content when you actually want to see it or you click on it i do think new reddit has potential but i had to do a pretty contrived example to get even remotely close to the performance not even the performance the amount of data that old reddit loads and so they have quite a bit of work to get even close to old red at this point and that's their old product so for the time being i am going to be sticking with old reddit big surprise you
