The hot soup almost went straight to Mimi Binnie: Unnie, if you just ate that right away, it would be impossible for you to sing today Binnie: it was pipin' hot Mimi: (Impressed) But there was a lot of beef in the soup, so it was probably quite an expensive soup Binnie: (As much as I love her) I poured in a lot (Thanks to the members) Mimi had a great birthday
