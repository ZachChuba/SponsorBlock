yes indeed the darksign brands the undead and in this line [Music] the undead are around and led to come out where they are locked away to await the end of the world this is your fate from the dark they came and found the souls of Lourdes within the flame what's up y'all I am Marcus also known as EMB and welcome to a full-on let's play of Dark Souls 1 it occurred to me after finishing the blood-borne playthrough that I don't have the same quality level the same kind of holistic approach where I combine both gameplay and lore and an in-depth way for Dark Souls 1 that I do for blood-borne now and it's really funny to me that because since the last time I really completed Dark Souls on camera I've written two official guides and had a lot of interactions with from software and I loved I know a lot more about their company the way they make these games and Dark Souls so this should be interesting to see like kind of a final take on all of this especially as we start getting ready for Dark Souls 3 but I am playing on the prepare to die edition on pc i'm using the dsfix mod for the 1080p which it's really useful you can really see these little environmental like the bugs and stuff the environmental details a lot better I really like that and I am using one custom texture I am using the black hard leather by magnanimous mud you guys can see it right here has no gameplay effect whatsoever but it looks really [ __ ] cool so I want to use it alright a nameless Knight dropped a corpse down here that had a key on it it was actually the key to our cell fortunately enough for us and if we look at it it says key to the dungeon of the undead asylum to the north kind of perhaps a hint that there may be more than one undead asylum there is an undead asylum in the north at least and that's telling us where we are in the world a mysterious night without saying a word shove the corpse down into the cell and on its person was this key who was this Knight and what was his purpose there may be no answers but one must still forge ahead not really sure if he the key down here for us on purpose or if it was just a twist of fate it doesn't really matter that there may be no answers line is really interesting me and I'll talk about that in just a few minutes but for now we have the black separation crystal this black crystal long a symbol of farewell is granted to banished Undead so if you're banished and sent to the undead asylum I suppose you can get this black separation crystal the crystal sends phantoms back to their homes or sends you back to yours beware a fickle use of this item if you intend to nurture relations wonder who gave that to you the pendant this is my gift item that I chose a simple pendant with no effect even so pleasant memories are crucial to survive on arduous journeys pleasant memories indeed we'll talk about the pendant later darksign the dark sign signifies an accursed undead those branded with it are reborn after death but will one day lose their mind and go hollow death triggers the dark sign it's really interesting to me because this is telling you quite a bit about the nature of our character right there like we are a normal human but we don't die we can't die and through repeated deaths we lose our self lose our will lose our minds and kind of turn into beef jerky like this just really really interesting and what do you do with someone who won't die and you want to banish well you've just got a lock I'm up in a Cell right and you see these guys have been locked up similar to what we have but they have lost their minds hollows if you will it's got crying I want to point out see on the left side of his body see this kind of growth this kind of vein structure here and let me punch him in maybe we can get a better look on the the left side of his chest sorry about the knee there bro there we go I want to point that out because we have something very similar right really interesting just kind of a mass of nothingness right there really nice playing on PC we can actually see that pretty well in 1080p setting it dsfix for life baby and also we see a giant demon patrolling around over here somebody got hit hard so interesting corpse too because it's got a bag on its head it's got flies buzzing around it it's kind of kind of unique there yeah these hollows man they're in bad shape they are in very bad shape don't pee in a Boober the atmosphere this place still gets me and I've been it's it's just bringing back so many memories of the first time I played this game already just ooh this is gonna be a fun play three here we get our first bonfire of the game bonfire lids in order Beall fastball I'm actually gonna have to take that stuff off back to no gloves like always if we look up here if we look up here we can see there's a giant demon standing on the roof and it's very intriguing that an early concept art there's actually a demon there but it's not this kind of demon it's actually a taurus demon so from the early concept to the final product they actually moved those enemies around and we're gonna see and talk a lot more about those sorts of changes as we proceed but really cool to see that guy up there and take a few steps forward and you can see them down here you can fight the asylum demon at this point but there is absolutely no point to it I mean well there is a point you can get a weapon out of it but you can just get the weapon later through other means or you can just wait to New Game+ and kill him on the first encounter where you have a weapon to me I consider just a huge waste of time not even a particularly great weapon well I mean every weapon has its uses but I just don't particularly like it so we're not gonna fool with it a whole lot of work not a whole lot of no yeah hold on I was about to say a whole lot of working out a whole lot of effort it's a whole lot of effort we're not a whole lot of reward and I am not about that life all the Crowley crowd II the cloudy gray sky the undead asylum just very very alright now we got our longsword to battle to battle this hollow apparently still has enough wit to use a boat but not enough wit not to [ __ ] with me first fog gate alright here we see the night the nameless knight from earlier he's actually not nameless but nameless Knight from earlier and he is in a room with no exit it's he's all walled in here this would be the exit but there's some rubble falling next to this gate so I can see the light streaming down its the courtyard that's the bonfire we were and the asylum demon was on the roof over there just a minute ago can't reach this item just yet whoa and as we proceed up these stairs classic from soft trap I guess they have to have the ball down the stairs in every every game they ever make a kiss and still got it all right fantastic aperi timings a little bit it's actually very difficult to East to Dark Souls again after playing blood blood-borne is so fast compared to this game rusty iron ball there in the corner see the hole in the roof it looks like he was knocked down here possibly by the Asylum Demon which we have already encountered ourselves hi oh you you know thank goodness I'm done for I'm afraid I'll die soon then lose my sanity I wish to have something you and I both own dead give me out right there we learn a little bit about the hollowing process where he's going to die and then lose his sanity death certainly still a trigger for for an undead to hollow that one last final death that where they lose the last bit of their sanity and it's interesting too that he knows he's about to holla it's really really intriguing but as he said we're both undead so let's let's hear him out I have failed in my vision but perhaps you can keep the torch Lily there was an old saying in my family the long dead are chosen and dine exodus from the undead asylum maketh pilgrimage to the land of ancient Lords when thou ringeth the bell of awakening the fate of the undead gunshot well now you know and I can die with hope in my heart oh one more thing here take this an estus flask an undead favorite oh and this now I was bid farewell I would hate to harm you after death so good and thank you so this night was on a mission to perform a pilgrimage to the land of ancient Lords those who are Undead are chosen he wanted to go to the ant land of ancient lords and he wanted to ring the bell of awakening so that he could learn the fate of the undead this is apparently an idea that was passed down through his family which could be taken as an indicator that being an undead the dark sign itself is actually hereditary we will see evidence against that later in the game but this is one piece of evidence that you could take as meaning well families are undead and it's passed down in that way so good thank you and as we leave the room he's going to die fortunately the hollowing process appears to take some time because even though he died right now he's not attacking us as a hollow yet yet that character there's actually quite a bit of cut content associated with that character there was a text dump of a bunch of unused dialogue files that was taken from the Xbox 360 version of Dark Souls 1 a long long time ago and in that text out there there was a lot of really interesting unused content that that is is legit and one of the things was that gentleman oscar of astora he just gave us the second floor east key key to the iron bars on the east side of the second floor of the North undead asylum once again North undead asylum so they're very likely to be other undead asylums the undead asylum is a giant undead prison segmented by countless iron bars if an undead were to escape from a Cell passage to the outside world would not be gained easily it's an undead prison so as we saw before what do you do with people who won't die that you want to get rid of well you lock them up Oscar also gave us this Estus flask the estus flasks are linked to the fire keepers the dark tales also make reference an emerald flask from the keepers soul she lives to protect the flame and dies to protect it further I think this is the only place in the game where the dark tales are actually referenced so this could be part of the legend that he was talking about before that the undead who were chosen to escape the northern undead asylum go to the the land of ancient Lords in pilgrimage to learn the fate of the undead this could be part of the dark tales but we don't really know this is just the only reference I think in the game to it an emerald flask from the keepers soul and that's that's kind of a hint as to the nature of these Estus flasks they're made from firekeepers souls but Oscar I'm gonna call him Oscar and maybe we shouldn't he's actually just the the asylum night in the final final version of the game but if you go by the cut content Oscar he was originally intended to encounter you at several different points throughout the game and I'll try to talk about him at those and talk about those encounters when we reached those points but it's worth it to note that content can be cut for a lot of different content can be cut from games and this is just something that I've observed it's not always sometimes it's because there's not enough time to complete it in the schedule like they just don't have time to finish it and so they have to cut it that does happen but sometimes things are designed early on as a concept or kind of a rough idea or a sketch and then just quickly does it just as quickly as they're made they're discarded so things like the the Taurus demon being on the roof I don't think that's I don't think that's a something particularly important I guess is what I'm trying to say like a you could you could think about it well there was originally supposed to be a tourist even there but it's really just one light piece of concept work and it just doesn't really matter now Oscar may actually have more significance I think that the reason that he was cut from the game is that he makes things a lot more explicit than they are and we know how much from soft and particularly Miyazaki San likes to just hint at things some of the things that Oscar was going to say really really make the story a lot more explicit and once again we will talk about those and encounters as we get close I did the forward r2 jumping attack trick there if you do it if you normally if you just fall off fall from a height and press r1 you can do a plunging attack but if you jump forward and before jumping are two like this off the ledge there's actually a glitch that lets you land that attack and then also land the plunging attack pretty pretty crazy but did a lot of damage to you the big pilgrims key we just fought a giant demon and you might be wondering why these demons are here are they the jailers for for the undead that's one possibility and I think that's part of one of their part of their role but it's really interesting to me that they also I think they also serve as a test or a trial and when you read the big pilgrims key it kind of starts to become a little bit clearer as to why keep to the inner door of the undead asylum main hall big key belonging to a chosen undead pilgrim a chosen undead pilgrim not the chosen undead a chosen undead pilgrim but this chosen undead knows not what this pilgrimage has in store so any undead in this Asylum who is powerful enough to overcome the demon can have access to the key so are you chosen because you're able to are you able to overcome the demon because you're chosen or are you chosen because you're able to overcome the demon I think you're chosen your label that's chosen because you can overcome the demon we'll see more about the chosen undead and its nature as we continue but very intriguing that getting this key that is supposed to belong to the chosen undead who can overcome the trial to defeat the demon there it leads you nowhere there's only one place that can possibly lead like this there's no this doesn't get you out of this island it doesn't get you to escape like into the normal world all this does is lead you on your pilgrimage that's the entire point so it's just really really intriguing to me the undead are being gathered and imprisoned here by people who are perhaps fearful of the undead their undead are seen as cursed and yet someone has arranged for particularly powerful undead to be able to actually escape from the undead asylum but the only place that they're going to let them go is on a pilgrimage to land of ancient Lords perhaps the people who ever are the people or beings that have arranged this are the same that have created the dark tales or spread the legend that a chosen undead is supposed to go on a pilgrimage no let's start our pilgrimage in the Asian legends it is dated one day and undead shelters to leave the undead asylum in pilgrimage to the land of the ancient laws Lordran [Music] and just like that we have arrived at the land of ancient Lords Lordran and our pilgrimage has begun yeah alright there's gonna be a lot to talk about we will investigate Firelink shrine next time guys welcome back to dark souls man this is going to be fun it's it's one of the one of the things it's difficult to get used to the speed of the gameplay but another thing it's really interesting to me to see how much of the things that I originally people had accused me of you're just guessing like there were lots of stuff that I just kind of speculated or tried to figure out and I was wrong about some things but these days I've realized I was right about a lot of stuff as well and it's funny to me how explicit exactly a lot of the things are especially when we start talking about some of the cut content as well but as we as we go through this playthrough I think it's gonna it's really gonna help us get ready for Dark Souls 3 and Dark Souls 2 will follow it soon alright guys I am Marcus listen zmb I'll catch you next time I got to do the thing we could do the thing again later y'all
