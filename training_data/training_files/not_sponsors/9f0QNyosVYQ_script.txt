today's video is sponsored by dashlane hi would tell here like most of you one of my favorite things to do when I get a new phone is to test out the cameras the Google pixel for excel is the latest phone to hit the streets so you know I've got a ticket out for a world I brought along the galaxy note M plus and the iPhone 11 Pro to see how it stacks up against two of my favorite phones this year now I don't really have anything planned or structured for today but with all these beautiful fall colors surrounding me I'm about to come away with some beautiful pictures let's get it as usual I'm starting with some selfies first shot here is by the water with the Sun rising to my right just for fun here's an unedited sample coming out of the Sony rx100 mark 7 this is perfect laying in a pile of fall leaves doesn't get more crucial than this am i right the last selfie is going to be a portrait selfie where it kind of just blurs out the background with software it's extremely useful when there's a lot going on behind you that you don't want the focus to be on in the picture okay this is a pretty tough shot considering how complex the background is [Music] okay when you suture really quick there's people walking by and these last few pictures were taken by the water don't let the pictures fool you though I was freezing my butt off of these it was getting way too cold by the water so we had to relocate now I'm at the park and I came across these beautiful stairs it's gonna be the perfect setting for my next shot working on the poses here don't know exactly what I'm gonna do I'll be you know I feel like all through chemists filled it with the shot for reference this is what the scene picture looks like on my sony a 64 hundred so I've always wanted to take a picture of me there's some leaves up and air you know the one that you see in magazines so let's go ahead and do that right now [Music] okay that's look longer than expected but I think I got the right shots check them out I must have started a movement here because three or four more couples came and started doing the same this one here is another portrait shot taken a little further away okay the lighting over there wasn't all that good so let's try this spot instead son looks good it's hitting this spot right here let's take a picture here for this next shot I came across this really cool picture online that I love so I'm going to try to replicate it right now okay so it didn't turn out the way I wanted but uh yeah I tried I will say this if you're trying to look at pictures of under direct sunlight it can be a little challenging because the screen on the pizza for doesn't get as bright as the other two okay so what about objects how does portrait mode handle things that aren't people too easy what about this the pixel 4xl unfortunately doesn't have an ultra-wide lens according to google wide shots are fun but they think telephoto zoom is more important they call it super resume let's see how super this really is [Music] bless you pretty good I'm going to be honest it's very rare that I ever zoom it to take a picture but I'm sure some will find it happy ultra-wide next year please google the thing I take the most pictures off is my dog this little troublemaker here you channel go check them out I just finished having dinner it's a dark outside low light time fYI the iPhone doesn't have night mode on the selfie camera this was an interesting shot underneath a really blue street lamp although the pic support isn't realistic I do appreciate that I tried to correct the white balance just want to share some Halloween spirit with you guys [Music] neon signs are always fun to take pictures of in this photo I loved how the note came out alright I'll let you all check out these last few nighttime photos I had a blast filming this I didn't bother taking any Astro photography shots our skies just aren't clear enough here in the city hopefully this gives you a better idea of what these three phones are capable of in terms of pictures it's been a long day so I'm going to call it a night
