this is part four of the defenders rewrite series rewriting Marvel Netflix's defenders if you have not seen parts one two and three I would highly recommend going back and watching them if you haven't seen them in a while I'd still recommend going and giving them a look the links to all the videos are in the episode description but maybe you don't have time maybe you're busy or on the treadmill who knows so here's a quick recap of everything you need to know to get you up to speed for part four if you do not need it you can go to this time in the video okay matt finishes off the rest of the hand in new york city with the small assist from the iron fist Danny Rand and the daughter of the Dragon Colleen wing Hogarth does a favor to Jessica Jones and gets Luke Cage out of prison Luke finds out that a business woman named Alexandra bond is developing Harlem into oblivion because of economic displacement caused by Alexandra everyone notices an increase in street-level crime Luke goes to a protest where he learns of a vandal calling himself the wrecker who has become the people's champion Danny destroys a ran to deal with Alexandra later that night Luke investigates a mysterious lightning strike and is knocked unconscious by an unknown figure after she hears about what happened to Luke Claire calls misty Jessica Danny Colleen and Matt for help misty and Jessica work together to try to figure out who hurt Luke since they are the two best investigators in the show Danny uses his Chi powers to heal Luke Danny tries to track the energy signature of the weapon that hurt Luke Matt tries to figure out if there's a new weapon in town he goes in shakes down Turk Barrett and Justin Hammer finds nothing Jessica and misty run into Danny and Colleen at the crime scene and because Danny and Colleen both partially matched the description that Jessica and misty got of the person that knocked out Luke Jessica and misty tried to bring Danny and Colleen in for questioning Danny and Colleen refuse and get into a fight with Jessica and misty right before either can hurt the other Claire and des now healed Luke arrive and tell everyone that he remembers what happened he met someone at a construction site who was struck by lightning and it turns out that person was the wrecker when Luke tried to take him to the hospital the record' refused and knocked out Luke with some sort of magic crowbar Danny Colleen misty Jessica Claire and Luke all come up with a plan led by Danny they're going to use Danny's magic sensing abilities to find the record and then they're going to fight the wrecker and take the crowbar from him Claire calls Matt but he refuses to help he still doesn't want to work with the team after what happened to Elektra she tells Matt where to find the group the team tracks the record to a warehouse Luke ambushes the wrecker and Danny and Jessica steal the crowbar from the wrecker but it is revealed that not only can the record summon the crowbar with his mind like Thor does with his hammer the wrecker has also assembled a group of three super-powered criminals they are calling themselves the wrecking group the first member of group is someone who we will not name yet but eventually will be called Thunderball he is the strongest member of the crew he picks things up and throws them at Jessica the second member of the group is someone named piledriver he's the fastest member of the wrecking crew and he fights you Kage the third member of the wrecking crew is named bulldozer he is the least vulnerable member of the group he wears a helmet he's kind of like the juggernaut bulldozer and the wrecker fight Danny and Wright as a group is almost lost Matt as daredevil shows up after a pep talk from stick turns off the lights in the warehouse saves the group and they retreat okay let's do this so episode 5 walk this way this is your first episode where the entire team is together the first meaning immediately after the fight with the wrecking crew Colleen and Misty take Claire home maybe Claire was injured or something so they have to get her out of there and the other four team members talk this will be similar to the Chinese restaurant scene and the most important thing about Episode five is we have to figure out how every character feels about one another so let's start with Matt who is still in costume as the daredevil he does not let everybody know who he is he thinks Jessica Jones is a careless drunk who is only gonna get in the way she's not serious about all of this Matt respects Luke both took down criminals protect their neighborhood and Matt's not sure about the iron fist yeah the iron fist helped with the hand but Matt is tired of stick in the chaste and secret agendas and ninja organizations he wants to leave that part of his life behind him so even though the iron fist seems like a decent guy he's not excited to be working with another person from that kind of world so math mood right now he is all business these guys need to get it together if they are gonna stop the wrecking crew Jessica Jones she does not trust Matt because he's in costume and she hasn't figured out what he does yet not many people know who the devil of Hell's Kitchen even is and it's super unclear what powers he has and if he's on their side since he wasn't part of the original plan Jessica is relying on Luke as the voice of reason and another normal person in this crazy world that's spinning out of control and Jessica is really angry with the iron fist first they fought and then he sent him into a fight that ended with them almost getting killed this kid doesn't know what he's doing he's gonna cause trouble so Jessica's mood she is frustrated and everyone but her and Luke is an idiot Luke Cage he's skeptical of the devil of Hell's Kitchen but mostly glad to have him around Luke can tell he's a serious guy Luke is also trying to keep Jessica from killing the other two and Lucas curious about the iron fist the iron fist seems to be trying to do the right thing but he seems young and naive so Luke's mood right now he is defeated he has just lost his second fight to these guys and he doesn't know what to do and then last one Danny Rand as the iron fist again completely in costume nobody knows who he is yet as evidenced in the first episode Danny always wanted to work with the devil of Hell's Kitchen but he is embarrassed because he just needed to be saved by the devil of Hell's Kitchen now the daredevil might think he's a loser or a problem danny is dreading the I told you so he's about to get from Jessica he feels like he needs to prove himself to her and he finds her lack of training troublesome and finally Danny feels guilty about Luke both from the bond protesting and from getting him beat up the second time so right now Danny's mood is embarrassed so a couple things that are gonna happen in this conversation jessica is going to want the devil of Hell's Kitchen and iron fist to tell her who they are she doesn't trust them and they refuse Luke says and maybe they're not bulletproof they need to protect their identity - I trust them so then Matt takes charge they're gonna answer a couple questions we have at this point why don't they go to the police they don't have a ton of information to give the police and if the wrecking crew was able to do that to them a bunch of superheroes the police wouldn't stand a chance they'd only get hurt also why not send the Avengers well at this point in history The Avengers don't really exist there's no Thor there's no Hulk Plus this is 2017 so we are in the throes of the superhuman Registration Act they figure the news will get ahold of this and if the Avengers want to come solve this problem they can but kind of like vulture and Spider Man homecoming they can't trust The Avengers to deal with this problem because the Avengers have so many problems of their own so then Luke remember something about the conversation he says when I was talking to the wrecker the wrecker said the time he knocked me out was the first time he had used the crowbar maybe the crowbar came from that construction site maybe the lightning strike was him getting it and that makes a lot of sense so Matt comes up with a plan he wants to see the original construction site he's the only one that hasn't been there yet him and Jessica Jones will wait until night and they'll go together they say Luke needs to stay out of the way he's a public figure and the wrecker know who he is jessica is going to go with Matt to the construction site she wants to get another look and yeah maybe she's also in danger because she's also a public figure but she's Jessica Jones she doesn't care she's doing it anyway Danny and Luke will stay back to protect Claire in case the wrecker comes looking for her since maybe people know that she's luke cage's girlfriend and maybe the wreckers gonna try to use her to get to Luke misty and Colleen we'll see if they can dig up anything else so Matt and Jessica are gonna go out to the construction site at night he's still in costume she's not they argue because that's how those two characters interact a lot like they do in the show specifically she's still not cool about the whole mask thing and while that's going on Danny and Luke are spending some time together at Colleen's dojo which is where the team is hiding out yeah maybe someone like misty could use the dojo to figure out who Colleen is and then maybe figure out who Danny is but at this point that doesn't matter and that's not what misty and I cares about now anyway they all kind of trust each other and Danny calls out Luke he's like look you're um you're really strong but your form is messy I don't think you know how to fight probably because you don't need to I can help train you instruct you so that you're better equipped to deal with these guys but Luke rich acts Danny's help misty and Colleen spend more time together bonding cut back to Matt and Jessica they're arguing more he's trying to talk to her explain his situation Jessica wants quiet and she's going to say this specific line I'm only gonna say this once Devilman shut up that will be important later back to Luke and Danny they are bonding over what else 90s hip-hop not to nitpick not unlike my podcast mostly nitpicking but duh Luke Cage a show is all about music he meets Method Man they switch hoodies it's a cool moment and it's something very specific to his character on the other side of things one of the first things we learn about Danny Rand in his series is that he listens to outcasts on his iPod they both would have similar tastes and music so let's use that as a way to get these characters bonding this will become a lot like Luke Cage season 2 episode 10 Luke accepts Danny's help Danny teaches Luke about Qi Luke thought Danny would teach him kung fu and Danny says well Chi is more important it's about team it's about harmony you can communicate mentally through chi Danny trains Luke in meditation and Danny and Luke get along pretty well the friendship is forming and Luke is learning from Danny he's not learning kungfu but he is learning about his Chi and Danny is getting a little bit of his confidence back because he's making a new friend and he's teaching someone something he's good at now Matt and Jessica get to the site at night they can't find anything jessica says yeah I don't know why I let you drag me out here and Matt says Jessica Jones shut up and then Matt here is something underneath the ground using his daredevil sonar sentence it's covered by rubble and he asks Jessica Jones to move the rubble and they find this weird cave underneath the construction site covered in like rooms maybe they're Asgardian maybe they're alien maybe neither no one's seen anything like this before this must be where the crowbar came from it was under the construction site and then Jessica finds a pair of safety glasses jessica says wonder what these are doing here matt says must have been a construction worker left him down here and Jessica thinks for a second she says oh my god I think I know who the wrecker is and that's episode five it's just team building character moments fun stuff interactions what this series was really supposed to deliver on the things that like I said Luke Cage season two had to do because defenders didn't do enough we're gonna have Luke and Danny spending time together Colleen and Misty spending time together Jessica and Matt spending time together and the entire team is going to be interacting learning from their failure getting ready to move on and at the very end of the episode finding a crucial piece of evidence that is going to give Jessica the information she needs to tell everyone who the wrecker is which will be done in Episode six of the defenders rewrite wreck shop oh and one more thing I wanted to take a shot if you're anything like me
