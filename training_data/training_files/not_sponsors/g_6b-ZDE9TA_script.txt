[Music] made the street edgewood way half a mile away from first line spoken in the movie is already explaining my Dre's walking alone in the suburbs that subtle clarity increase of the music as he walks around the car making him realize the doors open one-mississippi two-mississippi it six which is how long it takes to lose consciousness opening your movie with a two minute eleven second long take there's a lot to be said about the subtext of get out but none of it would have mattered if Jordan didn't act or the crap out of this film not to mention flipping the tried and true cliche white girl walking through a dangerous neighborhood putting us right into Dre's shoes by never letting the camera cut away [Music] we'll all the Swahili speakers just half the movies spoiled for them since Seiki leezak wah-wah hanga roughly translates to hey listen to your gut save yourself you know get out childish gambino is always a win this apartment is a win rose the literal honey pot buying more donuts with that crazy eyed smile I know it's only crazy Gaiden hindsight but that's where we are you might want to put an actual razor in that thing Chris would do a better job of getting all that white off you feel Jordan peels genius evident again in less than 10 minutes the head knock isn't for anyone but the audience and your immediate reaction is cute I relate to that not mmm I wonder if she's trying to lure her boyfriend into a forced brain transplant to become part of her family which is really weird we considered the implication of all of her relatives including her grandfather having a sliver of their psyche know they were once attracted to her and have been intimate with her what you were the one thinking it like a brain my dad would have voted for Obama a third time if he could have I'm only telling you that he's definitely gonna want to talk to you about that but that's because he's a lame dad more than anything else they are not racist I'm gonna get deeper into this later but for me that's what this movie is about something we know to be a lie in the movie is so easy to believe the parallels to real life were just mind-blowing for me [Music] she cares for his health tears for her family's future investment double duty not to mention being against smoking and sitting up that her mom is against it lets him get tricked into hypnosis a little more easily you know you picked the wrong truth can be stranger than fiction I think rod would be confused to see his buddy Kris married to one of her relatives or whatever but you got a recruit where you can write yeah how about done with a casual slavery people harvesting jokes the scene that makes much more sense later when we learned that Chris's inaction at least in his own mind led to his mother's death so the shot of his foot leaving the pavement while aesthetically pleasing regardless is also a clear action he's taking not to mention the city boy entering some upstate woods further solidifying the different perspectives with no debrief after where Chris has to explain that compliance is just easier in these situations it's laid out plainly for us but that's just a distraction from the double-duty narrative work where Rose is defending her boyfriend against harassment racism or not cops will take any information you'll give them especially to protect a woman and actually in the ultimate mind bomb he may actually be aware of black people going missing in this area still either way now we know she's woke psych she'd rather not have a paper trail of Chris coming to her family's home what that's like quintuple duty are those Omega symbols like Jordan plays with so many horror and filmmaking conventions as Erin Hannon once said and as julia has reiterated many times although I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything we get a little bit of that in this movie but Jordan makes a statement here by not coming in for the greeting the camera keeps a distance and it makes me want to keep my distance not to mention probably racist grandpa watching on disapprovingly which is just like like he's mad his granddaughter is with the black guy but also he's in a black body that once dated her it's a whole thing and even when we get inside the camera still stays back moving to the next room by itself nothing says get out like red pants some things are reading too much into a scene and sometimes Jordan Peele directs and Africa pointing towards the camera feels deliberate such a privilege to be able to experience another person's culture experience steal tomato to made up my dad's climate of Fame would be by Jesse Owens and the qualifying round so you could say he lost his race he almost got over ha almost it's actually hilariously dark that this is all about Dean's dad never getting over being beaten by a superior athlete that he then projected on to the entire black race and convinced a bunch of other white people to agree with him some black moles down there Jordan hinted that it wasn't intentional but hey like a mold made of a black person you would put a white brain into my mother loved her kitchen so we keep a piece of her in here her we keep her in here does anything have one meaning also she loves this kitchen so she's not cleaning as the housekeeper she's cleaning it as the owner who loves it and what's weird that she's the second black helper or that she's just standing still alone in the kitchen we hired Georgina and Walter to help care for my parents I couldn't bear it I let him go couldn't bear to let his parents go not Georgina and Walter obviously but in not letting Georgina and Walter go they're also not letting there it was a different time parents racism go either yikes by the way I I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I couldn't cherry on top of mr. Armitage is casual racism tour such a privilege to be able to experience another person's culture he said only because Chris is black you're gonna love this he said only because Chris is black white family black servants he said only because he said only because quickest thing he said only because well that's okay we don't have to talk about that the first time Missy does her little three Clank triggers after learning useful information about Chris that she knows would put him in a vulnerable state of mind after talking about it besides all the insane details and hints of the twist the Jordan Peele put in here he also pulled some performances out of these actors Daniel Kaluga leading the charge but you sort of like the Armitage is after this dinner at least the parents and Chris's response is like peek how to deal with an awkward person saying inappropriate things and then doing inappropriate things but being quick enough to not let anything get outta hand while still being respectful to someone that doesn't even deserve your respect I aspire to have such I usually just get awkward who's your friend and genetic makeup love that Jeremy is the only member of the family that really doesn't have a facade who he is different Jordan played us all like a fiddle with Rose we witness her having the veil slowly lifted from her eyes to realize that racism isn't just burning crosses you rose among the thorns the confrontation of just terrifying dude still and his groundskeeper garb sprinting at night with the dolly zoom messing with perspective you find him so obviously a trained psychiatrist who specializes in stealing black people's bodies is gonna be good at easing Chris into a state of heightened suggestibility but also this is his girlfriend's mom many of us would be sitting there dutifully answering questions as well to the creepiest modulation ever and ask or to fill me with all the dread no you're in a good place what a line someone the nose and she sent him there with the stereotypical symbol of class privilege a silver spoon black bodies I mean cars arriving with white brains I mean people well people might be a stretch you can see it all over this dude's face it's taking I can't be racist I have black friends to a whole new level how could I hate something I covet and want to destroy fourth time through and the passing notice I took of color last time has been completely solidified for me now everyone interested in or involved in the sale or purchase of black people is wearing red even Rose brings Chris in a red car Gordon loves tiger Oh best I've ever seen calling back to grandpa sucks it running physical prowess is the most valuable asset when steel buying black body bad this complete lack of acknowledgment that he's even a human to the point that Rose has two mouths Lisa or Elise's name to get her to chill works both coming from Rose and mirror Rose I know Jordan calls her row row so I'll switch to that but don't begrudge me a Star Trek reference in a movie about brain transplants anyway they do not see black people as people doing this creepy woman you start to notice that when Chris isn't paying attention people are always staring at and appraising him Chris just telling me how he felt much more comfortable with my being here okay Logan might be just a straight-up racist everyone else is at least pretending maybe the irony of being a blind art dealer what I personally love about our blind art dealer vampire I know I always go to True Blood for Stephen rude like it's the only thing he's ever been in I don't know what's wrong with me but what I love about Bill do't Reeve is that he excused himself from the real racists back there I mean he physically separated himself and it's almost like a relaxing moment because he seems to be an ally but later you realized that the differences are at best and negligible but I'll make a case for worse no he doesn't necessarily want Chris for his black eyes but he's still envious of someone else's physical advantage Jordan said he thinks although Jim would never admit it he believes he'd get more attention as a black photographer so there's that too just in case you were worried I skipped over is it better lady red shoes clarification that nothing we see when Chris is around is real they're all only there to assess Chris so if he's not around the act drops and they can potentially eavesdrop on him and make sure he hasn't caught on white people making people sex slaves making comedy relief rod the voice of reason is inspired he's us yelling at them to not go upstairs just get out also in contrast all the red rod is in blue just like Chris for most of the movie I wasn't trying to snitch snitch rat you out tattletale race is one thing but the speech patterns and words used by Georgina and Walter don't match their age either which there was a whole other level of confusion in there and you assume they must just be brainwashed snitch is pretty universal and doggone Bieber is popular with exactly zero races at this point in time Chris is death Georgina might be the most complex and my favorite character who only gets five minutes of screen time a lot of people have said she freezes here because of Missy's clinking but it's quite a while before she comes out so it seems she's having an independent reaction she was also standing silent and still in the kitchen when Chris arrived and then again with the cake and now this this has to be the real Georgina fighting with the Graham off her control you can see her snap out of it when the grandma regains control her face shifts as if Georgina is coming through and then grandma is actually saying no no no to Georgina like no no go back to the sunken place for what it's worth I think this is just grandma admiring her new young skin [Music] there's that main opening theme sneaking in under the violence in Africa I'll make an Tanaka isn't wearing red because he's still deciding if black is better than Japanese oh man that bright light and his pupils like Dre came up out of the sunken place and then settled in as the light faded it could also just be a representation of the flash effect in slo-mo but I'm going first one we've got level one surface interpretation Logan's mad Chris took his picture all incognito and he's telling him to leave the party level two is Dre warning Chris to get out of this town and away from these crazy people level three is Dre yelling at the white dude and his brain to get out of his body level four is rocker no no not today not me and confirmation for the eagle-eyed viewers of a similar dragging no no we're just very happy that you're yourself again ha I don't know I could be off here but bingo feels like a definitive old money white people game and since the story is told from a black point of view Chris has no idea how it's played which turns this auction into a hodgepodge of confusing things I more think it was about adding old-world lore but I think it's funnier my way you could also draw some crazy conclusions about peels feelings on love but let's just say that Rose is a psychopath and most people don't have the ability to fake love this well it's actually heartbreaking that Chris feels like he can share his shame to her when she's about to destroy him but we buy it we buy that he's invested in her and he's not just gonna leave even though the Swahili keeps telling him to yeah the finality of them all entering as if this will be the last time Chris does so he's different no again rod echoes the audience which is a fun game to play but at the same time we're never really screaming at Chris he's about as smart or smarter than any horror movie protagonist if I learned anything from Dexter it's that serial whatever you want to call ro ro she's kind of like a serial monogamist they really like keepsakes for their conquests offering an orgy of evidence if they were ever caught subtle yet not so subtle surrounding of Chris Jeremy blocking the door Missy blocking the kitchen Dean blocking the living room and even roses blocking the stairs almost harmless if you don't know something sinister is happening Daniel Kaluga one last attempt to get out you know I can't give you the case for a paper oh alright I'll crush your soul cuz she's right he knew whether she's just sadistic practicing for her next victim or literally forgot she's a bad guy I love that Pele allows us to hold on to hope until the very last second I'm sure Chris was still hoping against hope that she was just another one of her mother's hypnosis victims to forget Georgina and Walter to forget she better even dated a black person even not being able to find the keys could have been a trick from her mother nope RORO might be the most evil of them all sadistic it's sadistic and she's barely even paying attention at this point she's rolling up her sleeves tucking her hair behind her ears and then putting it up in a pony pushing her bangs to the side and becoming a completely different person you've already damaged him enough oh man I'm just remembering another double meaning hey hey the shining hey hey that's two so is a voice when it's Jordan peels been doing this a long time like midway through tube TVs not even at the end the production value this guy has seen some Casey nice dad and there you go it's not even Rosa's fault she was legitimately born into this bonkers hyper racism and that is part of the point you're only blameless for so long he didn't dress like this plus he's married to a white woman twice his age and that would explain the clothes it's that simple this is exactly why they've been able to get away with it people are allowed to change and what would you believe brain transplant ring or sugar mama I haven't had much desire to leave the house oh my god and now I can never trust another human ever again knowing that even one of us is capable of that I don't mean railro I mean Allison Williams what sorcery is this you want a lucky ones trust me Jeremy's wrangling methods Jones way less pleasant so Dre probably wasn't talking to Rose on the phone someone else lured him there and Jeremy grabbed him off the street the piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put keeping those intricate connections intact interestingly Jordan did his research and leaving the brainstem would be the best way to do a transplant apparently they did it on some mice in the 80s speaking of Jordans research according to some actual psychiatrists Missy's portrayal is pretty spot-on your existence will be as a passenger so the question is how much did Black Mirror pay you for jordan's script Daniel that's just a joke just too many similarities to ignore I've let people know and there is your horror they don't hate black people if any think they admire them are envious of them grandpa runs at night set it all up so they could be better Sportsters but then we get this more insidious form of marginalization I'm not racist but I'm not about to question a system already in place that I can benefit from after all I'm not kidnapping people and removing their brains the black body was gonna need a white brain whether it was mine or not no one here a a man not to mention his assumption that seeing through Chris's eyes his actual eyeballs will be the secret to his success as a photographer as if Chris's brain interpreting the images his eyes see isn't what actually makes him great again not realizing the value of Chris as a conscious being only his physical attributes goodness Jordan feel and again you can hear the opening song underneath the typical horror score sure listen to those ancestors Chris poodle not something you generally hear when bocce balls are involved also comeuppance and also that nervous tic ease had since he was a kid finally pays off also Jordan had a custom chair made so Chris the african-american could pick cotton to save his life yeah Chris you listenin yet jump-scare reversal which by the way two out of three jump scares involve a deer so like yeah also a brutal good enough reason as any do not burn candles in your sterile operating room Oh more brutality movie is like drive it just starts later also a determination win for Chris nothing like stabbing someone through your own hand we assume he was counting Mississippi in his head with Dre but since he's fed up with Chris why not add insult to injury apparently judo also teaches you to think a few steps ahead hmm knowing if you reach for the door Jeremy would kick it closed again hoping his leg up for a stab I want to stop talking like that okay now its comeuppance speaking of only caring about people for their physical prowess and making money off of them while they take all the risks Bing I'm talking about being the search engine further evidence that everything we saw from this one day is just a big ol act for luring their victims in she proudly displays all her X's on the wall like a deer mount the sort of free spirit happy-go-lucky Rose with bangs as gone RORO eats her colorful cereal and white milk separately while drinking said milk through a straw to avoid even the semblance of imperfection with a milk mustache and decisively bites an individual loop of fruit all dressed in pristine white who lets cut hiccup some slack here and point out that it's actually intended as a Knights Templar helmet and I'm gonna just jump to the conclusion that Jordan Peele loves Assassin's Creed one last time as memories and guilt can mess with his day good news everyone it's a rifle see asking you shall receive you know what I want to get chased off the llama to shotgun that explains why Chris only had state ID Steve I'd be and grandpa finally won that race against a photographer with a limp from a car crash he was in 15 seconds ago but still and a light again in the pupils Chris again being three steps ahead using his gift photography rather than just a knock-down drag-out fight allegory of Fortune a different work of satire condemning the papal court basically the Pope's internal government was so divisive in its time it almost got its painter arrested today you'd laugh at that idea but consider how this scene would have gone over with the MPAA 30 years ago 15 years ago woohoo that smile will haunt your nightmares more than anything else in this movie and mercy for someone who doesn't deserve it but Chris needs to be different than her this isn't her manipulation working on him this is Chris winning by not giving up who he is one more flip a double flip of a horror cliche just like Dre being the victim in the opening scene cops pulling up at the end of horror movies is always a good thing it means you're safe it's over but we all pretty clearly see how this scene looks meaning Chris is screwed but that it's Rod Jordan's first arguably more realistic ending was that our worst fears would come true and Chris goes to jail for murdering poor helpless Rose thankfully he decided to give everyone a little happy fantasy escapism version of reality you know letting Chris actually get out I mean I've told you not to go in a house stand one more female family member left to die by the side of the road but this time it's his choice and action rather than inaction I picked get out for Halloween because it's technically horror but you know as well as I do it's not traditional jump scares or gross out visuals it's psychological like I said this turned into a part 1 but part 2 is either done as you're listening to me now or will be up tomorrow or the day after it's up in the car thing and in the description if so don't worry this isn't a new thing after endgame it was just a coincidence that I picked a much denser movie than I remembered this week turns out I had more thoughts about the subtext of this movie than the horror aspects and I wanted to give that section its own video since it no longer made sense to segue to my stranger things video to get me so part 2 was either there now or will be shortly go watch my stranger things video it's literally free when you subscribe to curiosity stream all kinds of content coming at you so much so that there won't be an everything great about video next week I'm currently teetering on the precipice of burned-out dumb-butt here let's do this vote in the card up there which movie you'd like a 60 second review for next week sound good good [Music] you
