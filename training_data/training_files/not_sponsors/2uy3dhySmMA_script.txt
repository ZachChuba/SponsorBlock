the one in the water which is their main I mean I think we got it in grief the [ __ ] out of that and then they know we own it one layer balls they have they have a turret on top of their airspace it's a too large for space and then the one that the minis in the water see that's erm aim would it be fine if I could take a look at that yeah I did yo I bagged you I back you up here since probably

pool what the [ __ ] dude I'll be on after I published my video I think you had shot me got me they had nine so there was nine on each side so nine times four yeah like 32 turrets it's the same in both bases I got a soon no wonder [ __ ] people want them to be electrical-based well brother the good thing is I probably you have good allies it's like guys like this you guys had no idea that they have that minute aren't saying and you're gonna want to maybe learn the in-center okay just that's [ __ ] we also gained a okay yeah it was fine you literally can't predict you have to take 32 minutes it off [ __ ] hey guys so today I'm at the gate [Music] if you have it has fun will be more prepared next time I don't think they know where you live in LA they shouldn't you want them to kill them I didn't kill anyone no less who is it with the rocket will get the farming sulfur tomorrow dude I'd like to actually see how much [ __ ] lead they have there we got hella D like we opened it up to their bed yeah yeah to their chest we I saw workbenches too should see our turrets for stopping us yeah next time I'm thinking if we just in Center up its firm yeah we need to finish if you'll think it over yeah I'm good we would have had that a hundred cents they didn't have a shirt so they might have had more than 9 on your side yet so my people more than 36 I make it gun I'll definitely hit you guys up you know send us all right see you guys to see them jeez god I'm gonna reel of the jobs yeah [Music] did you guys see in that base yeah oh [ __ ] Ethan Omega in to their core like they're mainly yes exposed but we'd like this Russian it's like we were we worries we had to use regular Rockets on the actual turrets and that's expensive and we think by the end of it we cleared eight of the nine turns m2 outside three outside usually bases like that are crazy stacks with sulfur and rockets they probably have two boxes of rockets that's my guess I don't really look at those basis like okay all the sides are surround returns it's like some modded yeah that's exactly what I was thinking when I saw them thank you so much for watching this video today be sure to join my desk or if
