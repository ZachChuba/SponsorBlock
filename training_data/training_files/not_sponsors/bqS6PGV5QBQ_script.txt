bad that's good what the hell man that's freaking good it alright congratulations man I'm Audi I'm using mine be hard always you've got a nice little defense yeah yeah buddy introducing to you a new episode waters what that thing is so true I can't believe it you're thinking a while oh [Music] that's pretty good I haven't done like a nice poison running forever okay all right we're gonna try our first ever personal best run attempt with feast got my boy LP tails got us sexsomnia dog crap Guardian rope this is one of the harder ones to pee because you don't really get much food I'm only looking at one extra brew from you no doubt so we got the tents cool hwhip because that is my best DPS weapon at all far surpassing that the hosta and I have the dental work to help me bypass the mercenary Rangers and majors I'm just gonna tank them with the dens on defensive get the crystal open the door I also brought a long bruise because I will need it to no prep this run and also I'll get a lot of restores anyways for a meter down insect on so I don't need to bring a lot of resource and what are something different here we got ourselves dragon bolts this time just in case I need a clutch I want to be mostly camping the crossbow so that random else would be a bit more safe let's give it a try now oh cool I had to wait let's go hopefully Textron goes by quick cuz if it doesn't go by quick chance the P beam goes down a lot too as well dammit this electron is not going so well then it to specs but didn't do as much as I would like haha damn bro you want to calm down I show you I can just yeah just go with this alright fibers damn I got this joy dude alright this is it moment of truth time to tank the boss holy [ __ ] the tank keep taking keep sinking keep sinking come on dense oh [ __ ] I'm gonna die we got here at 10:30 for alright if I do 11 minute ohm I should be able to beat the times I just needed to whale of a minute home No where the Frick is it okay oh wait why'd I just wait oh no I didn't mean to do that all right I just whip snakes back said oh my god the whip is so freakin strong Jesus Christ it man like hosta whoo dang it this sucks you do the oh my god that's so unlucky man honestly it's so freakin lucky come on this [ __ ] off dope oh that's so lucky dang it man why did it put that poison there Oh hum I got like one burr I should be okay hopefully so I only have one brew to finish off the third face and the head phase and my goal is to carry this brew all the way to the head face because during the third phase I will try my best to take no damage at this balls whatsoever through a strategy generally called four to zero so essentially I'm just constantly attacking between the magic hand and the melee hand using like a rubber band effect mechanic which I'm not going to go into detail because it'll take forever to allow me to switch between the magic hand and mainly hand and do damage back and forth without taking any damage the goal is to get both the magic and the melee hand of course down to near zero and then clear it and then carry on the final phase with that one brew and hope the bus I gotta be careful only I have like no food so I have to be really careful okay I have two minutes to clear the head face so oh wow 54 holy crap oh my god what is that 66 Co Hall baby I can hit higher than that I'm pretty sure 21 minutes I should be able to do this Wow I should be able to go blow pipe I should be able to do that pump it nice there we go we did it this is the Papa pre scout raid damn dude that's crazy 22:33 I beat it by almost a whole minute Wow well that's nice we did it alright we can beat this one if you get like a fibula tectonic fossil layout or something probably I don't have to worry so much on food but this is our first ever attempted speedrun and yeah there's a lot of room for improvement though well in terms of especially the logistics part of it but now it's fun that was fun I'm down to do that again alright so my boy Ricky found us an interesting right here that potentially can be the time this one's crazy though risky but I do have some food here in this villa so I got a fly through me at all Krabs guardians no problem cuz Fela and then hopefully survived tanking the Jody room and with that being said I should be in the clear possibly for a maybe even a sub 20 you know all right we got ourselves uh under five minutes for the first floor so that's pretty solid I guess so far so good oh wait wait wait I'm an idiot oh [ __ ] I forgot to put on my fins bulwark wait what I don't have space shits god damn that was dumb I might die because of that yikes [Music] Lanka okay yeah my my skipping was a was pretty bad okay for Bruce it's not too bad I suppose oh okay honestly that feels slow this first face felt you slow I really need the whips ahead but it didn't hit anything I would say it was sloppy you know the biggest problem was all indeed this ohm was just bad orangey I just couldn't hit so me over 12 minutes to do this home alright so after that failed attempt I got another attempt by mr. solo ohm here he's got mystic good crabs into shamans into me a down so the only thought I got is muted out which is one food so this is gonna be even harder than last time but this is overall probably faster than last raid solve for these skeletons that's something that is specific to this layout for speedruns so let's give it a try hold the champagne oh my god oh my god dude salvaged so busted this one is gonna be done in like a fraction of the time oh [ __ ] that's not good man can't believe that got hammer in the wrong spot cost me a good amount of time okay well at least downtime is four minutes which is the best downtown we've ever had go go go this time I'm doing it a lot faster so oh [ __ ] 72 HP I might die please don't die please don't die oh my god oh my freaking God that was so freaking close holy Frank oh my lord got my heart beating there a lot all right eight minutes eight minutes and 30 seconds van we're gonna go down in under nine minutes let's go don't fail me with oh wait I don't have a speck ah [ __ ] I hope I can make up for it oh shoot I got lucky there at the Ross shield on and I was still ended aspect nice good good good all right on to third face with 15 minutes on a clock yes and the freaking ruby boat oh my god Oh another one yeah this is gonna be insane baby boys a deed arts I should have brought a dragon honestly oh damn boys beautiful dude that's nice not a bad PB smash the the PB by like two minutes though so I'll freakin take it nice Oh what has she got a purple oh my goodness I was feeling somewhat of a dry streak you know coming up I ever go boys Oh baby a dragon on two crossbow third yeah third dragons are crossbow cool oh no my damn it please turn it red yeah that was so clutch to have a bow before on my mane oh wow okay looks like I'm going to 70 dry at TOB tonight you know [ __ ] I'm feeling an art game not going on oh oh my god my second ever mega rare ah and it's another stupid code I imagine imagine my second ever mega ready alright so I do have my point tracker excel sheet where I keep track of all my drops and every single rate that I've done in terms of the points so ever since getting our second mega rare we're now at 26 million points which is pretty crazy cuz if you're just talking about like one specific mega rare weather is the MALDI cold eye or the twisted bow which is one in 30 million I'm getting really really close just four million more points that I'm at the average for a specific one of those so we're also averaging about a little bit over 30,000 points of rain as you can see most of my rates are a bit over 30,000 a few occasional deaths but overall still 30k plus on average the rate so if you scroll all the way down this is where our current progress lies cold.i number two alright ladies and gents with me it's time for me to wrap up I gotta go make some games at the theater but the boys and hopefully break this stretch week at the theater were over 200 plus dry and I'm down a breaker with anything hopefully at the fender that'd be great and again things to rates for a response ringers today though for real man helped me a ton with finances so and anyways if you are new to series you want to support the cause feel free to subscribe and build this channel
