you know what is going on guardians and welcome back to another destiny 2 gameplay video hey in this video we're gonna be talking about a topic I think a lot of gamers will be interested in with trials coming back many people are suddenly thrust into a game mode they aren't you know really well rehearsed in so in this video I'm gonna be offering some clear tips on how to most efficiently win rounds in trials but so I hope to see you out on the field in Fraga all right let's talk destiny in this video you're gonna see some sniping you're gonna see some shotgunning you're gonna see sidearms hand cannons plenty of different things so the tips I'm gonna give will attempt to be universal so regardless of your you know weapon and subclass preferences maybe you can gain some insights so the very first tip I'll offer is simple but very very commonly overlooked tip number one go into every round with a plan yes have a plan for every round it could it could even be a bad plan I don't care but you need to be on the same page a bad plan is way better than no plan at all me and J ended up helping tons of people go to the lighthouse this past weekend and we did it by having a base plan that we could you know make modifications to every round for example we found early on widows court that fighting in the church courtyard where most people exchange their initial gunfire it tends to be a 50/50 there's head glitches everywhere around that courtyard I mean everywhere around the courtyard we didn't like it so we made a basic plan we're gonna go Main Street and be flagged back alley every round every single round we're gonna go down Main Street or that back alley one of the two if we needed to make adjustments after that then we would communicate those in the moment but we have a basic plan for every round and the more we did you know round after round match after match day after day the more muscle memory we developed around those angles those places to look those head glitches to check it cetera so this was key for our success so go into every round with a plan communicate that plan so you're all on the same page and if you need to make adjustments just call those out so everybody is well-informed tip number two set your teammates supers up for success nothing is more frustrating than when you pop your super and push but the enemy team just rotates around the map in the opposite direction and they kite it out right but you what you need to do is to send one or two players to cover those escape routes while your teammate with the super pushes from the other side so you'll put the opponent's between you making them shoes you know whether they're gonna challenge the super while getting shot in the back by you and your teammate or are they challenge the two players while the super catches up from behind them so it's not foolproof but it's the best way to capitalize on supers by a landslide so use barricade smokes anything that will slow the enemy down so they can't just run away from that super okay tip number three don't be predictable some teams will send the same player to the same initial location every time so pick up on this adjust to it and people will pick up to this if you do it right if they always send someone to the same headglitch you know we'll just learn to look at that head glitch first and we'll look for that pick so you're gonna want to pick a few different locations to shift between as you set up your initial gunfights don't be predictable they will adjust they will punish you tip number four and this one is huge I mean this one's huge find the one guy to bully okay we've won so many rounds because we see on the radar that one guy splits off even just for a few seconds to check you know a different sight line or go on a flank call it out and have everyone collapse on him put them down quickly you know a lot of round wins will come down to who gets the first pick and that usually means finding the one guy to team fire down first so find your one guy and bully him and have everyone be ready to respond to that call out you know there's one guy over here one guy broke off that should be your trigger to all just collapse on them and to push that one guy tip number five when you're the last man standing make sure you try to kite the enemy team out until you can get a 1v1 one be ones aren't you know they aren't usually when it's just you and one guy alone in a room duking it out most 1/v ones in these situations lasts only a couple of seconds they're short windows that come and go quickly so you need to be perceptive to when one is about to present itself I've got a handful of last-man-standing clutches in this video for reference but a lot of times I'll just move and run and rotate until the radar lets me know okay a guy is about to be engaged with me before the others so sometimes I have to turn and fight them sometimes I'm running into the one guy while the two are chasing me but your goal here is to move in such a way that you're not visible to most of the opponents at the same time limit your engagements to control the sightlines force players into 1v1 so even if they're really really brief one he wants force them into one view once and then use the things like your special weapon your grenade your melee abilities and eliminate the first guy quickly once you start dropping bodies then you're more free to rely on your primary weapon and have a more drawn-out duel but lead with whatever's gonna give you the you know the best chance to secure that kill the fastest tip number six call out everything every radar ping every body shot you land when you think someone is moving or flanking call out everything every piece of information is an opportunity for someone on your team the information that you're receiving might not be pertinent to you in the moment so you might not think to call it out but it could be crucial for someone on your team who has you know their position differently they've got different abilities guns etc this also applies a lot when you're dead if you're dead keep your perspective on your body as much as you can this gives you a different perspective than your living teammates and you can get information that your teammates cannot call it everything you see while you're dead your goal is not to make decisions for your teammate that's alive your goal is to give them information that they need to make the decisions that they think are the best in those moments since you know they know what they've got cooled down how much special ammo they've got how much super energy they've got they're the ones they're gonna make the call you're just feeding them information so they can make an educated decision in the moment for themselves tip number seven play to the strengths of your build if you have a shotgun then might I suggest finding ways of engaging players on parts of the map where shotguns are pretty good for example on widows court you may consider focusing your energy on controlling the B flag area as you can dip in and out of cover pretty easily there or if your shotgun der find ways of creeping up closer and closer while your teammates shoot from further back the second your teammate lands a body shot or inflict some damage then you can spring an action and conversely if your teammate gets hit with like a sniper rifle you bodied and then prepare for your opponent to push up aggressively because they want to capitalize on that damage you might actually catch them with their pants down they run you know straight into the barrel of your shotgun if you're sniping your job is to focus on head glitches power positions long sight lines that's your territory to control ultimately you should be asking the question how can I make the most of what I've got going on right where should I focus my attention where should i position myself to leverage the strengths of these things that I've got equipped tip number eight control the first body this is a this is a pretty big one and this is a huge like fundamental thing that'll change the way you play elimination this is not a ten out of ten times sort of thing it's more like a nine and ten times thing you got to read the room right but generally speaking as soon as someone on your team gets a pick you should all disengage from whatever it is you're doing no matter what it is to disengage from whatever it is you're doing and go control that body right if you have someone absolute you're confident you can secure that kill then you know sure that's fine go ahead and go for kill number two but usually if somebody on your team gets a pick or you get a pick you call it out and everyone on your team should stop holding whatever angle they're holding looking at whatever sight line they're looking at disengage and go straight to controlling that body that is your number one priority and unlike destiny one players can start taking damage immediately by the way after being revived so I've seen a lot of players do this because it's like muscle memory from destiny one you see a revive happening and you wait for that character model to like go through the revive animation and then stand up and that's the moment that they take their Snipes this isn't destiny one it's actually different there are no immunity frames the very second you see that that that players character model render in on that revive and they're doing that sort of crouched down stand up you know a little animation they can take damage that entire time in fact there is a clip in here you know I'm sorry it's probably not happening right now as I'm speaking but there's a clip in here I know there is because I edited this video there's a clip in here where there's a revive and I take the shot literally the second that revive becomes available so keep that in mind that's really important so yeah tip number eight control the first body very very very big thing to do tip number nine don't pay for a recovery I mean you laugh but I mean a true story I've ddosed four times now since trials launched four times every single time it has been someone on another players account so in our story Billy who doesn't think he's good enough to play trials and get the loot but he still wants the gear well he he pays $50 for a recovery on a website right he finds a website they say they can get you to the lighthouse and get you here to loot for $50 you think say you know what I like a $50 to spare I would say lighthouse loot is worth $50 to me I'm gonna pay for this account recovery okay shortly after he's contacted by a player he gives the guy his money and his login information and then this player takes control of their account and DDoS is there away on that account to the lighthouse and gets all the gear signs off tells Billy hey the job is done got your character the lighthouse he's got all this loot and Billy is none the wiser he gets back on his account checks his loot very cool in the meantime every team that that recovery ddosed has reported Billy's account next thing Billy knows he's been slapped with a ban and can no longer play destiny to on his account that recovery took his money and moved on to his next recovery and continues to knock players off line and Billy helped fund it listen I'm speaking from experience here this is a very very real scenario that I see multiple times a week including today right I can show you screenshots of conversations with Billy's who were shocked and upset that their account gets banned listen don't pay for a recovery you're you're rolling the dice even if you pay for a recovery from a legitimate person who isn't going to cheat you're still rolling the dice because it's actually against Terms of Service for both Bunji and PSN and twitch as well you most likely from being honest you most likely won't have anything bad happen to your account you probably won't but there's still a chance there have been legitimate twitch streamers for example who have been banned on Twitch and had their partnerships removed for doing recoveries these things do happen and you have to decide is it worth the risk for but let me tell you something me and Jay have gotten every single raffle winner flawless for three weeks straight with one exception being a card that we got ddosed on and we still got that guy flawless afterwards anyways look I don't care how bad you are if you want to see the lighthouse we can get you there legitimately for free and with zero risk on your account you may even learn a thing or two and if you don't want to play with me maybe you don't like me and you think I'm an arrogant tool you know what that is fine go get a free lighthouse trip from Java rated rhythm Jason KJ Hobie you know these are awesome people with awesome communities and they love to help people out I can't tell you what to do with your money but I can tell you that real people are getting their real accounts banned because they trusted someone with their login information and paid them to take control that's the risk you run you know cheating is the most efficient way for people to take money off of recoveries since ddossing is cheap and easy on console and hacks on PC can be purchased for half the cost of a recovery on PC right these people are coming out on top monetarily let's say for example they charge you $50 for a recovery and they charge the next guy $50 for recovery in the next guy $50 for recovery and they bang out three lighthouse runs on three different accounts and they bag 150 bucks well let's say somehow their PSN gets found out and they get banned you know what they're gonna do they've pocketed $150 they can go to a marketplace and pay $5 for a brand new account that's leveled up and ready to go in trials so now they're netting $145 they get three more recoveries in right there up to two hundred and ninety-five dollars they pay $5 for another brand new account that are now netting $290 they do three more recoveries you see where this is going this is the easiest fastest way for recoveries to get their job done and make the most money and because it is the easiest fastest way it's you know very very common right now I would urge you guys don't pay for a recovery you're rolling the dice and you're helping to feed an economy that is not good for this game admittedly the - it is bungees responsibility to find ways of combating you know cheese hacks and ddossing it is their responsibility to fix that problem not ours but there is something we can do in the meantime to help alleviate you know the predatory nature of recoveries and that's just to not do it so that was just little soapbox for you tip number 10 finally tip number 10 find at least one player that you can play with regularly and get some chemistry with I'm telling you I've been playing weekly with Jason that's Jay a whi CIN on twitch by the way and we're we're on the same wavelength that's where we think similarly we coordinate our movements without you know having to call it out we're just in sync right now on Monday we played trials helping people get to the lighthouse and even though our third player was constantly changing we managed to only lose two games over the course of eight hours of playing that's largely due to the fact that we've generated chemistry you got a bro down you got to bro down with another player and start refining your chemistry girls can be bros too by the way in fact if you're looking for another another person I recommend this is sort of off the top of my head another person I would recommend miss KD on twitch she's a fantastic gamer and she helps people the lighthouse as well with Jack you might check them out as well anyways learn how each other plays and be committed to getting some consistency in rhythm nailed down this is so key to playing well in elimination every single mistake big or small can determine the outcome of a round so every movement every peak every jump is high risk in trials so the more natural you can get your gameplay the better and not having to wonder about what your teammates doing or thinking is huge for building confidence and consistency well there they are my top 10 tips for making trials your b-word and sc2 I hope you gleaned something useful from this you know 32 year old gamer age aside regardless of my reaction speeds being those of a grown man with two kids a dog and a minivan playing smart and informed is the best approach and has led me to you know 40 flawless runs so far so almost all of them being helped ease taking people to the lighthouse so be warm and well-fed my friends I hope to catch you in the crucible
