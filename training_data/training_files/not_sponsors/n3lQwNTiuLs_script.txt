welcome off the ranch I'm stuck in Mexico my home is safe that's because of home is safe we can take our trip I'm gonna send you back to the start of the reason New Mexico and then will come after your birthday [Music] hola amigos - Diaz como estas me llamo Matt bienvenidos aliens another Mexico yes s me Barco me helicopter Oh mail it and if any of you watch my video yesterday you saw that I'm here for the Baja 1000 the biggest truck race in the world and unfortunately it rained so much which I was really excited about because it was gonna make the race awesome make all the trucks super muddy it's gonna be so fun to watch but it rains so much that they ended up postponing the race till the following day tomorrow which wouldn't normally be a big deal except that I am leaving early tomorrow morning I already have my trip scheduled back and I can't get it changed and I'm gonna miss the Baja 1000 by like an hour like my flight leaves and then they start the race I came all this way to miss the Baja 1000 the other thing that really stinks is I was supposed to be watching the race right now and there's no race today and so I have nothing to do all day my plans are totally thrown in the garbage I'm sorry so I gotta go find something to do but as they say when in Mexico they probably don't say that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so we've just been out driving having fun and watching all the other vehicles there's a lot of vehicles that are pre running where they're just seeing what the course looks like after all the rain the course is actually dried out super well there's still some puddles but like it was puddles every ten feet before and now it's much more spaced out and dried out really really fast if that Mexican soil was just dry and desert like and Sandy and so it it soaked it all up and the sun's been out and pretty all day today and they should have an awesome race tomorrow you know what I'm not here we've been driving Jeeps I've been driving that white one up there I don't really have a ton of seat time and Jeep so this is kind of cool for me to get to spend a bunch of time in them and I realized I just like Raptors way more Raptors are just way better than Jeeps they're so good like there's one Raptor with our group and he's just flying through all this stuff the jeeps doing a good job his tires are solid but the Raptors is better they're more comfortable they're better looking and they're killing it out here in Baja just I just really like my Raptor check out there after though that is Cameron Steele he won the Baja 1000 overall last year riding on you have Goodrich tires even on that prerunner raptor they got some BFGS on it looking good howdy ma'am you have a very big utter we're at the cava to kiss so the Cheesecake we're gonna go on a tour of some dairy stuff and then some cheese stuff I mean some wine stuff listen the dog didn't come home with me but maybe you can wait wait wait come on we can be friends just got home I have actually a really good day hanging out with the guys and playing and driving jeeps all day today it was fun we just off rode it and had a great time thank you BF critic for having me out here you guys were awesome host and just unfortunate circumstances that made us not be able to actually see the Baja 1000 that's happening tomorrow because of scheduling and I just couldn't I couldn't stay an extra day one other issue turns out getting home is gonna be tricky as well I have to go to Tijuana tomorrow to fly out of the Tijuana Airport which I'm a little nervous about never done that and I'm not flying home I'll explain more later but I don't speak fluent Spanish and the place where I'm going I have a feeling there'll be a lot of people don't speak English so I'm nervous I've never been like thrown into that like I'll be all by myself and I have to just rely on my Spanish I can do this I can do this okay yeah so for the jacket and a backpack on I wanted to be ready to go as soon as my alarm went off it's super early in the morning I have a two-hour drive to Tijuana and then I gotta go to two on airport and then I got a fly on the Aero Mexico plane I have a layover in Mexico in a different city it's fine I know enough Spanish that I won't get lost when I'm by myself and Mexico hola me llamo Matt yo necesito por la in el avi√≥n por favor what is this muchas gracias mucho gusto [Music] [Music] [Music] hey welcome to Tijuana Airport I successfully turned in my bag I checked it and got boarding passes I think I'm I think I'm on the right track I suppose did a good job you'd be proud of me doesn't make it through security now wish me luck well my fears were unfounded this is super easy traveling it on air more and it's super nice well it's actually way nicer in a 2008 report well there's gonna fly through on me right now I have a little bit time to cook for my mic that extra time just in case I got confused or lost but it was super easy I my straight to my geek there's no lines no wait I didn't have took my shoes off and I went through security [Music] [Music] hey I'm in Mexico City stoy and let's see the dad did Mexico I made it it was fine easy and follow science because the senator Burton every report tries to make it super easy to make it easy for their passengers problem is don't know if I'm gonna be able to get it today I'm gonna try something to try to catch another flight to another place not back to America though wish me I've been at the airport for three and a half hours now and I was supposed to not be here this long my flights delayed so I may just end up being at the airport forever I don't know the guy hey just kind of work and he's like yeah yeah bud probably work I'm like okay but I don't necessarily want to stay in Mexico City forever it seems like a nice place it's also huge I didn't know a big mix of city was it's a capital of Mexico it's also I think the biggest city in Mexico and it's huge and I'm possibly here indefinitely it's not ideal we're about to board an hour and 20 minutes [Music] [Applause] [Music] made it but I don't think the plan I had is gonna work out I think I'm actually gonna spend the night maybe tomorrow my plan for we'll see vo Mexico encouraged I will see you guys tomorrow I'm going to bed [Applause] [Music] oh hey what cameras that number
