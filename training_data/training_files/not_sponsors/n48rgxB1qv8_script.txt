I'm trying to figure out how exactly it is with six sticks that they're getting to 16 gigs of ram no I think it's 2 times 4 and then there are wait 2 times 4 would be and then I think there are 4 yeah 4 - is that what you said for 2 days yeah sorry yeah I think that's it oh so that means only the first 8 gigs are at quad-channel speed actually I don't know if this generation even worked like that I might be better off pulling out the the two mismatched ones we're gonna see if we can get a deal on this stuff to make it like properly make sense because the pricing differences between the two are very close so I'll see what we can do could you do a power supply and the 954 90 bucks I know it's a little rough but the the original power supply you offer me was the eight hundred and seventy five watt so if I take one of the lower wattage joints yeah yeah same place so we can choose waiver no oh okay yeah I was just saying if I took a worse power supply from the used bin maybe that could make more sense okay all right what can you do for me I mean I want to I need a power supply and I want to go with the 950 if possible I can't make it I had your dollars a hundred bucks yeah okay yeah let's do that they've got two thousand dollars to build the best bang for the buck PC but they have to do it without internet they've got three days to do it and on the fourth day we find out who the winner is in this edition scrapyard Wars brought to you by D brand so Keith wasn't able to help me out personally but to their credit this has been about the smoothest experience I've ever had setting up a scrapyard wars pewter I threw in my drive-thru in my graphics card popped my install media in and Windows is installed I was really worried that 60 gigs might cause Windows tend to throw a little fit but apparently it's above the minimum so it's a bit of a concern that even though this is a 3.7 gigahertz processor we're sitting at ninety percent literally installing a dotnet framework patch and a game on Steam pathetic games his launcher really used that much CPU what so there was tax I was kind of hoping it was gonna charge me tax but you know that's good be legal all that kind of stuff it ended up at a price of about a hundred and twelve dollars which if I bought it at full price without a discount it would have been a hundred and ten so I basically got tax removed by a tiny little bit of haggling so now we need to return the CPU cooler and try to get someone to buy at least the hard drive that will probably have to be done tomorrow because I think we're pretty close to at a time so I'm not the most confident with that decision because it's a pretty low-end graphics card but realistically due to how the testing is laying out Cinebench is one third of the total score so buying a really overpriced graphics card could really throw my scores out of whack so I went with the cheaper card hopefully it's okay so we're going back into Canada computers to return the CPU cooler and I'm also going to try to peddle my wares for performance oh this is all I'm returning yeah yeah hasn't been taken over the box if there's tape on it the tapes still there so I have a question I'm assuming your answer is gonna be no but the computer that I bought I was able to pull some hardware out of it these things in the bag are junk and worth nothing I could tell from the bag yeah there's a there's a DVD drive and a 350 watt power supply and of Wi-Fi dongles none of that matters I do have a brand new two terabyte hard drive though hey you trying to train for something I'm trying to sell them to you okay Selvam yeah yeah okay so I found a guy to buy the hard drive and my mystery bag components which is the DVD drive power supply and wireless card names I'm giving them the hard drive for 25 bucks which is a pretty killer deal and then the mystery bag 410 which is much less of a killer deal but 35 bucks for me which helps a lot so here's all your stuff or I guess it's gonna be annoying to hold leave the money oh good 35 perfect there we go thank you very much have a good one we are leaving now to go back to the office because we are done the computer at the office works and we just returned the cooler which saved us 20 dollars and add a computer store I was able to find someone someone random and I sold all of that for $35 so it's day four we've got a system already I'm really not used to this and all that is left is to see if there's any optimization and tuning that we can do to squeeze out some better benchmark scores okay so everything should be in the advanced tuning tab I actually haven't really used extreme tuning utility before so okay I'm gonna big surprise to no one the multiplier is not unlocked it is really looking like there is not gonna be a whole lot that we can do in here okay I'm trying not to be disappointed by this I mean I did say it was gonna be similar to a core i7 37 cents what I said right yeah yeah and it is I mean obviously it's not ideal but one thing we can do is we can pull out those oddball memory sticks go back down to eight gigs and see if having some of our RAM running in dual channel or something was affecting our performance this is interesting so now we're up to 659 that is a significant improvement before it was 637 so we have gained a total of 25 points already which might not seem like a lot but when you've only gotten 600 now we're gonna shut it down again and we're gonna find out if in our workloads where we don't really need four channels worth of memory band we would actually be better off with the latency advantage of just two sticks because eight gigs of ram should be enough for all of our workloads and there we have it we have made up the difference between our CPU and the 3771 Cinebench point and all we had to do was go down from quad-channel memory to dual channel memory I think we're probably gonna run everything with eight gigs 25.40 one stock our score hardly changed at all setting our GPU to be overclocked I don't even know if it actually turned out any higher so we've got a frame rate counter up here one quick way to have a look at what your sort of CPU bottleneck is is to look at something not very graphically demanding like off into the distance so it looks like we're limited to probably around or the top of the skybox around 200 frames per second max then what we want to do is we want to put ourselves in a position where there's a bunch of characters character models tend to be some of the most demanding things to render so let's jump out and let's let's get near some character models and see how that affects things is changing the resolution to 4k and seeing how that affects it that'll actually tell us a lot about how CPU bottlenecks we are show me a big FPS drop oh okay that's not as big as I would have liked but we're also not quite as CPU limited as I might have thought we would be to our GPU usage oh okay no we're pretty bottlenecked so our GPU is only sitting at around 70% tops at 1080 and it's had a hundred percent at 4k and our CPU usage yeah you can see it's really using up to three full cores or more and then CPU usage drops down to not being a bottleneck at all at 4k so if we were running at something like 1440 we'd really be getting the most out of our hardware okay here's a nearby landscape we're at about 180 going back down to 1080 200-plus okay landscapes good buildings bad how about trees okay so here's some trees over 200 160 trees very good so basically pure GPU let's look at grass 150 190 ok grass good trees good I'm like here 120 looking at an actual you know more representative of gameplay scene here's my problem we prank that to 1440p 120 no difference whatsoever whereas if we went down to 1080 but we cranked it to epic a hundred FPS now we're GPU limited and if we go and we look at afterburner our GPU usage has spiked up to around 90% I wish we were running at 1080 high even 1440 high that the system to do it so I ran into a minor problem where you can see the power supply fits in the case it's in there but this metal tab was in the way because the old power supply was short so this was flipped over and in the case and blocking the power spike from go be knows go to the back because it's a full size power supply now I realized once I slide it to the back it doesn't fit in naturally you try to put it up here and get stopped by some metal that's in the case and the it the holes don't line up I could force it to if I like got rid of a bunch of metal that was in the case or I could just drill new holes in the back and dismount it where it is either of those options would be fine both of them take time of which we don't really have right now so my plan right now is to present the computer in the orientation that it is which is upside down but uh who cares not based on aesthetics so time to move on ok so I need to figure out how much money we actually spent I still have a lot of this lesson ok this is this is what I have left which is like yeah that's that's a lot which is good I guess I have to go through receipts now so this was the CPU cooler but I need to just ignore that because that was returned the best works eat that matters okay the SSD that matters and the power supply and graphics card that matters and then I need to consider the $35 that I gained if I just ignore the receipts for the cooler that's fine because we essentially just never did that so calculator 203 point 16 plus 1/12 plus fifty point two six equals three hundred sixty-five dollars 42 cents - 35 bucks equals three hundred and thirty dollars and 42 cents [Music] I'm at like a 50/50 percent confidence whether or not I'm gonna win but I'm pretty happy with what we were accomplished anyways because that is a pre bangin computer for three hundred thirty bucks and 42 cents especially considering we had no Isis to the Internet I think it's pretty good okay okay are we telling each other anything forever we telling each other how much we spent I think we should at least take out the vet take off the veils oh so the way that okay so the way the spreadsheet is structured I'm not that good with conditional formulas so we enter the first two scores and there's a conditional formula that says if score number three is zero then zero so we don't get like a div divided by zero error and then once we enter the third scores then we get a relative performance score populated then we enter the prices and the performance per dollar gets populated oh it can be done better than that but it doesn't matter yeah this was the you know while Luke was running off to Barnaby I liked it whatever it was okay so we're unveiling sure okay [Music] they're both surprisingly normal except mine is upside down yeah yours has yours has a case so that's an improvement over that one previous scrapyard worse Oh interesting a what where did you find one of these oh oh did I leave the price tag on the back there am I supposed to see that I don't know I'm assuming you didn't pay that much I apparently have a lot of extra ham hey hey hey careful now this is some this is this is a thing that could have been properly installed if I if I spent more time yeah okay got that VGA going on there this is a Windows I think is that 10 or 8.1 I can't not a hundred percent on that sticker I think this is Windows 10 though so I've got a pretty good idea I think of what's going on here do you I would bet that you can't guess what it is what do you think it is I won't confirm or deny but what do you know no no I want to be surprised I want to be I want to be completely surprised oh did you like my round collage that was a that was quite beautiful to collage I made it he didn't try to sell them I mean I sold over no I sold like four pieces of me interesting okay well that'll that'll be interesting alright iron up yeah [Music] okay so those friends no wait yeah yeah I don't see Osho okay okay so there's one Asus AF machine and one little boy I was hot I was worried that it might show a certain thing but it didn't okay alright so first ups in a bench I actually haven't loaded that yet it's downloaded okay okay I think watching this extraction performance here probably gonna go pretty slow that is pretty slow it's actually slower than I expected that's very slow I bet you can't guess what I have in there Xeon I don't know I'm pretty sure the Xeon is it I think I saw it on the oh no it does had Intel on your mark get set Cinnabons I'm pretty pretty fun fits my scrapyard wars is brought to you by D brand their new Nintendo switch kinara vailable now and you can also order tempered glass screen protectors these things look great they're crystal clear and they're durable you could even keep your switch in your pocket with your keys if you wanted to I actually have big enough pockets that I could do that look at that see those are big pockets learn more at the link below oh yeah the score will be pretty bad oh no that was the first square that started that just finished oh oh okay I think a gamble that I made might have paid off here but it comes down to price to performance that's why I'm not necessarily freaking out yet I'm still a little bit freaking out but like I'm not entirely gone at the moment alright how did you end up with change what is need to alright do that wait I need to find my phone sorry one sec I decided to yeah I had to pull my phone out of all my money sorry it's a difficult life so what's your score people say Mo Money mo problems I didn't realize finding your phone would be part of it okay okay yeah I'll cover it - this is gonna be really bad okay 668 299 but doesn't have me too freaked out yet I have a lot of money more than double the sin avenge score okay I gotta get my my spreadsheet here I need my laptop Cinebench lioness 668 is that what I said hold on don't look 668 so the hold on hold on hold on I'm verifying for the for the camera here there it is 668 okay and Luke your score was I believe 299 checking yep 299 all right whoops pretty close to the price of my computer okay are you ready to run well walk as it were yeah three two one leisurely stroll begins now this is the like smell the flowers computer yeah and all your money because it smells like maples there's the smell the burning rubber computer if this is anything other than pure storage okay my storage is not that fast that's higher than I was hoping mr. moneybags [Laughter] really want it that's the thing that's why I was wondering if we should reveal the price beforehand no because this is so blind this is very blind this entire competition from the start you can't use the internet you can't use maps and the price is flexible is it has been such like a blind competition hold that thought do you have a paper map I don't think I would have been able to find what I was trying to find even if I had a paper map so I don't think it would have made a difference okay weird so you can't use certain kinds of maps where did you get a phone book oh that is awesome that is great it's huge that is what she said and that is half of the lower people heads gas station did the phone book too that was a long crease debris I'm gonna make you watch that one oh yeah okay that's fair so you're allowed to use maps does not electronic one woof that one's pretty slow that's not pretty no that one is pretty slow but what I'm really wondering is if I spent too much the fact that he's running around selling stuff is a bit of a wild card I sold a Oh does it no it doesn't nope we're good so I have to be under half your cost I guess that's the whole thing right now yeah so we'll have to see how that lines up okay so three so unsure - thirteen five one nine and Luke five to one sex it only sort of all comes down to this because we don't know we don't know the price what the other one paid I am starting to worry on that front though based on this ticker that I saw in the back but we'll see one thing I'd evey ated from all medium on was view distance I don't fall medium all media what were you doing I'm gonna cry gonna have my phone breacher you said hi though 1080 hi sure I don't I think that's probably better for you at this point okay so things I changed I turned motion blur off because motion blur is garbage and I set view distance to epic because you should never play a competitive game without maximum you know you said hi okay that's fine I just clicks the high button okay so fine fine fine I'm down with emotional yeah right cuz that's a standard we've like literally always had alright I think you distance is pretty important fortnight but you know if we die because of that's a lot higher than me you know there we go you ready three two one go did you want to jump and where do you want to go go anywhere you want call it let's go to that part of the lake okay three two one go so we're going to the top of the lungs like the little tree oh crap you're driving really fast which one the one at the very corner that tree okay I see you you're a little bit in front of me I think being in the air has an advantage you're not even kidding it's mine so I hope I didn't dive too fast oh yeah these things take forever to hit the ground and I don't know how to make it go any faster I think if you go forward it goes down a bit faster I'm not sure though and I'm following right behind you who I'm trying to follow right behind you okay so you know what you lead I'll follow most enthralling benchmark ever I hold on a second that means I have a model in my screen and you don't okay let's just take these you take the one on the right oh sure okay [Music] and then we'll chop the big one together okay teamwork makes the dream work keep running straight sure okay why don't we go to loot that yeah just making sure I'm in your screen here [Music] there's go okay this red barn there's got to be something in this area fine go a little bit more into my screen there you oh the benchmarks over is it a wait how long did you set yours for three minutes 180 seconds yeah unless I didn't check the checkbox oh that's fine we can still we can still figure it out don't mean join a check hey saltado I might not have checked the like stop benchmark after box yeah I didn't I'm apparently pretty rusty what's gonna happen when we enter these values is it's gonna give us a total relative score okay so it's like out of tanning all of these I'm assuming right out of a hundred yeah yeah and it's the highest score is 100 yeah okay Oh 147 0.78 and then sixty seven point eight seven well that's better than I thought it was gonna be watching it running fine yeah yeah I knew that one no I mean it's worse than I thought it was gonna go ice it for me that makes sense okay so tense right now how I copy copy okay okay so here we go I am pasting them paste special paste values only okay so yeah so it's not if I if you spent half as much you're done but if you spent a third as much I got slayed okay how much did you spend should we should we say what's in it first and then so much how much we spent sure all right all right I do you want to crack my panel first here comes the panel crack I will say one thing before we even open this up yeah this is cool and I'm happy you got it cuz that's pretty cool the second I saw it I was like alright that's pretty sweet I definitely never saw any of these on my travels what the heck Oh what is that what card is that I'm running the that price tag why didn't you have that rabbit that price tag had some of the information oh I might have thrown it away but it's a I recall correctly it's a Z on 1620 v2 it's a quad core eight thread three point seven gigahertz my power supply is better than yours is 80 plus gold so yeah a lot actually not that it matters at all three point seven gigahertz Ivy Bridge so it's basically a 3772 at least it was once I removed this Ram so quad channel has a bandwidth advantage but dual channel has a latency advantage so it came with 16 gigs 2 by 4 and 4 by 2 so I'm just running 8 gigs around because for the benchmarks were running I don't need this and that's why I didn't sell it because I was testing those scenarios up until today other than that it is stock Lenovo workstation other than the x1 10 60 gig SSD 60 GB how much does that cost you 10 bucks oh my god I thought I got a really good SSD do apparently not and this I don't even have the other drive plugged in everything fit this is a gtx 1070 how much did that cost you I'm not gonna tell you that just yet that could hopefully make me happy ok ok I don't know though all right well it's upside down I think I have some idea what it is because I went to Best Buy and they had to something they had to guess what it is I think it's a seventy eight hundred eighteen yeah dammit we thought about that too I was like they wouldn't tell I called the checks dog how much you think I got it for 269 okay that's not right but Oh interesting Louis like pretty far off by like actually a lot like I'm not not even kidding am i lying Brandon these shakings it okay that's potentially a problem I do have a dope power supply okay and my SSD cost like four times as much as yours okay I don't know your graphics graphics card was impossible sorry yes Java code was very hard very hard is that where you were in Burnaby today no just yeah I was selling stuff how 9:50 did you buy it new no that okay the first point you keep talking about this power supply what do you look for modular what isn't this thingy then it's from an alienware it's 875 watts it's actually like a pretty modular but it only has one okay he wanted to sell me a 550 watt power supply for 30 bucks and I was like well that's BS so I got this one for 30 bucks it's a good deal the SSD was 450 bucks after-tax I had to buy one do I really couldn't fool you bought an SSD knew I did so it must be like one time is that the only thing I think that's the only thing I bought new and yeah it's 120 how much do you think I got the card for so a 1050 new was like a hundred and sixty dollars or something when I went to the store yeah I hope you paid $100 for it you know like a chunky yeah [Music] how much do you spend on your system I [Music] spent 77033 - oh my god you won what score per price wait I think my formula might be broken did you screw that up hold on a second hold on a second did they give it up because I'm pretty sure I needed to beat you by more than that in terms of price I think you won I think you just did to form Hilary ah wait no a total score per price would be ya higher would be better hold on a second h3 over I 3 h2 over I - yeah cuz all the scores are off by more than half wait no no no no no coz that's way more than double 660 versus 770 how did it get that close good dog but oh thanks Jay you inspired me to double it up good game but by 0.1 I was okay I was talking to Brandon I was like this is gonna be the first season that it's not even close one of us is just gonna slay the other one and then it wasn't I want to know if I don't wanna know put in thirty five dollars on top of mine oh no you're done you're done at 365 for sure so me selling the stuff at the very end is what made me win so I paid an extra $10 over my initial offer for the system that would have put me at thirty nine point five I let them talk me up ten dollars so that you letting them talk you up ten dollars and me selling a wireless card a DVD drive a 350 watt power supply and a two terabyte hard drive for 35 bucks which is actually a killer deal for him because the hard drive is what won it those two little deals is 770 right ed I paid 360 for the box oh this is where it's gonna come out wait did he not spend that much hold on a second how much did I pay 360 for the tower no I paid ya 400 for this and 10 bucks for my SSD yeah the brand is the place to go for awesome vinyl skins it's been that way for a while but there's something new now you can finally skin your Nintendo switch and your switch accessories including your joy Kahn's like look look how adorable it is with pink and purple but we could also swap those out we could throw white on there as well as your pro controller and even your base station they use high quality authentic true textured 3m vinyl on every product they feature unrivaled precision they've got an amazing configurator on their site so you can preview what your products gonna look like and decide well you know maybe I'd like I don't know green and white one maybe I like that look and their customer service robots are easy to work with and wonderful their products are affordable in they ship worldwide and you can check them out today at the link in the video description I felt like I was gonna get duped no no no I got duped and I didn't negotiate the video card at all it was such a great price that I was just like 400 bucks that's a pretty good price for a 1070 all right give me your intro fee so I can give these hey I get this one limited edition typo trophy yep this might be the closest one yet is it I think we've had multiple that were down the point well I think that's down to variations in the benchmarking like this one was close good job please try I like your computer and that was an insane competition I'm honestly surprised that we both came out with like actually what I think is really good rigs even if we were allowed he's online 404 success not found offline on point congratulations on your triumph that's cool all right GG bro you know what forget it fortnight is for losers anyway here you do get to take all of this though it's technically voice does that feel fair so thank you to everyone who participated thank you to D brand for sponsoring this season of scrapyard wars thanks to you thanks to you guys for watching if you guys dislike this video you know what to do but if you liked it like subscribe all that good stuff and we'll see you again next season
