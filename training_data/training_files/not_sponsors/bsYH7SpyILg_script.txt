hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with bait that's right this grain free paraguay and cheese flatbread
doesn't require any regular flour which is great news these days in fact the
last two times i went shopping the type of flour this does used was the only
thing left on the shelf and not only is this unique and delicious
it's also super easy okay pronouncing it might be the hardest part oh and by the
way to the people that invent words starting with two consonants is not
ideal but anyway let's go ahead and get started with some of this cassava flour
and it is in fact lutein free grain free and not free but not route free it's
made from a root and while it looks like regular flour it's much finer and i
think a lot closer and texture to corn starch and what we'll do to begin here
is add some salts a little shake of cayenne as well as some butter that
we've cubed up and then last but not least a whole bunch of freshly grated
cheese which in my case was a fairly mild cheddar and what we're gonna do
here is get into this with a couple clean hands and for the next few minutes
we're gonna rub together that butter cheese and cassava flour and my favorite
technique for this is just using your fingertips just kind of pinching
everything together and rubbing it back and forth and we do want to start out
kind of slowly because that starch is so fine we don't want to create a giant
cloud of that stuff and get it all over but then once that butter and flour gets
worked in can be a little more aggressive and if want can
transition between your fingertips and rubbing it between your hands and i
guess if wanted could try to use one of those wire pastry cutters but i
have a theory that your fingers are better because we're slightly warming up
that butter and cheese as we rub which i think might help integrate it a little
better and similar to when we're making pie crust what we're after here is a
mixture that looks like coarse crumbs okay so something similar to this where
we're not feeling there's any large chunks of butter left and then once that
set we're gonna add the only other ingredient here which would be some cold
milk and we'll go ahead and drizzle that in and then we'll basically use the same
technique we started with sort of rubbing it between our fingers until
it's worked in and by the way the exact amount is going to be really hard to
give okay I'll provide with a pretty good
guess but you're really gonna have to go by feel here
alright part of that's gonna be because of how dry your flower was and part of
that's gonna be based on how much moisture was in your cheese but one test
can use while you're doing this if squeeze the clump together but it
crumbles apart with just the slightest pressure it's too dry which in that case
we'll go ahead and drizzle in a little more milk and we'll keep doing that
until we think it's just right and the first time I made this I was so confused
because it only called for like three tablespoons of milk which wasn't getting
me even close to the right texture but then I realized the traditional cheese
use for this is much moister and because I was using something like cheddar I
needed to add a lot more milk but anyway no matter which use will want to rub
in enough milk until this happens okay we want to be able to squeeze together a
clump of this where it doesn't crumble apart until we apply a good amount of
pressure and also the mixture is going to kind of start to feel cool and a
little bit moist to the touch okay not wet not soggy but it will feel like it's
getting ever so slightly damp and that's it once we've reached that stage we can
go ahead and cook our flat breads up which we will do in a small nonstick pan
set over medium-high heat and after letting it get have for a
couple minutes we'll go ahead and transfer in about a 1/2 cup or whatever
it takes to cover the bottom of your pan with a nice even layer somewhere between
a quarter and a half inch deep and do see these made in different
thicknesses but generally I prefer mine a little bit on the thin side and then
what we'll do as soon as that mixture is placed in is go around the outside
around the outside around the outside with a spatula or maybe the back of a
spoon and just sort of press in any of those loose crumbles around the edge and
then once that's been accomplished what we'll do is cover this and let it cook
for about three or four minutes and by the way that's a wild guess or until the
bottom is golden brown and we're able to get a spatula under there and flip it
without it falling apart and right here is where I really need to be brave
and perform this maneuver with the utmost confidence even if you're just
pretending and once that's uncovered we'll go ahead
and slide our spatula underneath and in one bold movement we will kind of toss
the pan up while flipping that over like this so that went pretty well at this
point all we have to do is cook that other side for about three or four
minutes or until it's nicely brown and again that's just a guess on my part
okay that's gonna depend on the size of your pan and how much put in and the
amount of heat so you're gonna have to figure that out by trying a few I mean
are after all the paraguayan of how long in the pan that should be staying
but I'd say about three or four minutes as a good guess and when I thought mine
was done I went ahead and flipped it back over mostly to show off but also so
could see exactly what it should look like when it's done and that's it
we'll go ahead and transfer that to plates and then go in for a taste while
it's still warm and because this flower we're using has no gluten would actually
holds us all together as the melted cheese and of course that and the butter
is also what makes it taste so good and the casaba itself has a fairly neutral
flavor so while it's not exactly like a wheat flour-based flatbread it's not
really unlike one either and from what I hear these are generally just eaten
plain or with a little bit of butter alongside a nice hot cup of coffee but
in the spirit of full disclosure I just had mine with a glass of water and it
was still really good but anyway I went ahead and made a few more and of course
stacked him up so I could take a picture after which I enjoyed another one as I
find he's quite addictive and while I really do enjoy eating these plain as is
I thought I would finish up with one serving suggestion in case wanted
something a little more interesting and substantial so what I did was squeezed
on some chipotle mayo yes using a small ziploc bag with the corner cut off
although can't just use the knife and spread it and I went ahead and
topped that with some sliced avocado and some fire roasted red pepper rings and I
went ahead and garnish with a little bit of green onion and I finished up with a
nice sprinkling of coarse salt because avocado really loves that and that my
friends was just an absolutely fantastic thing to eat and I've never been there
but I'm guessing this is what the Millennials eat down there for breakfast
as their South American version of avocado toast but anyway the point is
can trust this up just like can any flatbread and whether you're looking
for a new and interesting gluten-free option or just can't find regular
flour because of the hoarders or just simply want something delicious to
eat I really do hope give us a try soon so please follow the links below
