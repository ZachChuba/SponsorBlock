[Music] for most people their wedding day is a big deal because it's time to show your love and lifelong commitment to another person for the next three to five years maybe ten at the most so if your think about getting married if you're engaged or about to be hitched and maybe use this video as a what not to do type of guideline probably one of the easiest ways to tell if you really want to get married is thrown up at the altar now wait for it watch as the stomach churns and grows like a waterfall after a rainstorm and the floodgates are open boom the answer is no he does not want to get married which is a shame because she seems like a pretty nice woman it even looks like she tried to catch some of his puke in and that's a rare quality and a woman kudos kudos to her oh how lucky for this bride it's not only her special day but also a special time of month well hello Aunt Flo welcome to the wedding now before I begin today's fun great game you'll not be disappointed I don't know what it is but I wouldn't trust either of these men to deliver herpes to a hooker and let alone bring up the secret wedding cake but in all fairness that cake looks like it was put together in a daycare bake class and about as sturdy as a bridge made out of cardboard so big kudos to the guy trying to save the cake from following with his teeth I'm all for having a wedding on the cheap but some things you should probably splurge for in this case a car would have been the better choice of wedding day transportation but if you're gonna whisk away your bride on a tiny motorcycle then the least you could do is avoid speed bumps or tire down people really need to start rethinking their wedding traditions for example carrying the bride around on top of a table is that such a good idea but then again if people stop doing stupid things who would we laugh at carry on my friends carry on speaking of tables here's another example and never mind carry on my friends carry on I got you I got ya I don't get yourself on e sorry about that sorry about the prisons I still love you though so if you ever wondered what it's like to be carried in someone's arms then wonder no more it's a lot like this Brighton grill ain't marriage grand hi and welcome to my instructional video on how to ruin a wedding step 1 make sure you get really drunk step 2 make sure to grab the groom away from the bride while they're dancing step 3 treat any pole like a stripper pole step 4 make sure the bride leaves bloodied and bruised thanks for checking out my instructional video for ruining a wedding there's very good reason why you don't see weddings at the circus and this goofball proves my point nothing wrong with having too much to drink and not remembering all of your wedding yeah fine but there is lots wrong with getting knocked out by your new husband and not remembering your wedding so unless you want your wife to feel like she just married Bill Cosby don't do self-talk backyard flips at the reception hey but I'm no fashion expert but personally I think the worst thing a woman can wear on her wedding day is fire here comes the bride all dressed in fire why do I get the feeling stop drop roll we're part of the wedding vows hey honey I know how we can save a few bucks on the wedding let's forget the candles and just like you on fire now before I finish it off I just want to say a quick thank you to all of you the viewers for all your support the channel has been grown at a steady pace so I can't tell you how appreciative I am towards each and every one of you for checking out the videos and taking the time to comment giving your feedback your suggestions amazing keep it coming I really really truly appreciate it
