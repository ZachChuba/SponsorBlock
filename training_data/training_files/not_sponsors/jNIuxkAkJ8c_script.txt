greetings well the fact is my name is
Sam and today I'm going to be talking to you all about the cheery subject of
prisons yes sadly the time has come my myriad of pun based crimes against
comedy and inhumane omits pronunciations of foreign words the new room has gotten
me sent to internet prison but please don't weep for me my adoring fans I'm
quite looking forward to it actually I'm gonna get all tatted up and get in shape
running away from all the people trying to shank me silly can't wait but what
are the benefits of building a circular prison how can reading as many books as
possible help you if you've sent a prison in Brazil and what should my
prison name be I'm thinking something intimidating like scary Sammy or Sam the
fact man / 2 out of 3 those questions are gonna be answered so put on your
orange jumpsuits get comfy in your bunk and prepare to shower with large groups
of other people as we count through 101 facts about prisons number 1 in case you
were curious a prison is a facility in which people usually called inmates are
forcibly confined separated from the rest of society and denied a variety of
freedoms under the authority of the state got it ok good moving swiftly on
number 2 prisons are primarily used within a
criminal justice system in order to house those charged with crimes who are
awaiting trial as well as those who have pled - or been found guilty of crimes
for which they are sentenced for a specified period of imprisonment just
getting the basics out the way you know number 3 prisons are known by a variety
of colorful terms often used to avoid the negative connotations of prison such
institutions may be referred to as a jail correctional facility Penitentiary
Detention Center remand Center or internment facility number 4 naturally
there's also a wide range of slang terms for prison including but not limited to
the slammer the can the clink the joints the calaboose the hoosegow the pokey the
big house or being banged up behind bars or up the river a particularly British
expression for being imprisoned is to be at Her Majesty's pleasure would you say
hilariously quaint way to refer to being locked in a room with an aggressive
cockney who beat up a stranger and Apophis reporting live on football team
while we're on the subject of keeping even get 10% off the premium plan at -
lang comm / 101 facts number 5 during war time prisoners of war or other
detainees may be held in military prisons or prisoner of war camps while
large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps a famous
and particularly egregious example of this is when the United States
incarcerated up to 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry during the Second
World War most of whom were American citizens yeah it's getting heavy this
early strap in number six outside of what many may
consider to be necessary uses prisons could also be used as a tool for
political oppression by authoritarian regimes who may imprisoned received
opponents simply for criticizing those in power often without fair trial or
legal due process hey it's heavy I know but this is the way the world is these
days this is generally considered to be pretty illegal in its own right under
international law governing fair administration of justice so don't even
think about it kids number seven with in criminal justice there are a number of
motivations behind the decision to send someone to prison the first of these is
rehabilitation which seeks to change the lives of prisoners in such a way that
they become more productive and law-abiding members of society upon
their release imprisonment is a form of rehabilitation was promoted by prison
reformers in the 19th century who unforgotten prisons as a more humane
alternative to the harsh punishments of the past number 8 another consideration
is that of deterrence not a man called Terence but a concept which holds that
sufficiently unpleasant penalties in the form of long prison sentences will
prevent prisoners from reoffending upon release as well as
courage potential criminals from well becoming criminals number nine one of
the more basic motivations behind the use of prisons is incapacitation put
simply those who perpetrate acts of violence or illegality who are held in
prisons are unable to commit more crimes thus keeping communities safer see
number ten lastly there's the role of retribution in the imprisonment of
criminals which bears little consideration for the possible social
benefits of prison and focuses instead on inflicting suffering and misery upon
prisoners out of a sense of punitive morality given the extensive use of
incarceration in today's world you might be surprised to learn that up until the
19th century imprisonment played a relatively minor role in the punishment
regimes of most countries as bloody a less humane penalties were more often
preferred early prisons were rarely built specifically for the purpose of
imprisonment and most cultures used makeshift cages or dungeons in already
existing structures number 12 bloody blah blah blahdy blahdy blah as
such there are numerous famous structures around the world that have
been used as prisons throughout history for example the Kremlin Chateau d'If or
basically any British castle and there's a lot of British castles it's kind of a
thing number 13 regardless imprisonment as a form of punishment has existed for
thousands of years the use of prisons can be traced back to the rise of social
organization itself in the form of the state along with the advent of the
written language which prompted the introduction of formal legal codes
basically as soon as humans form societies they require presence in some
form because some humans are dicks number fourteen several thousand years
ago the ancient Babylonians utilized places of incarceration called bit
killing where debtors and petty criminals were forced to work off their
debt and another news bit kilee sounds like a metalcore band from the mid
nineties number 15 the earliest known use of imprisonment as a form of
punishment can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia described in the oldest
known surviving law code the code of ur-nammu which itself dates back to 2100
or 2050 BCE it's a great read by the way but to save you some time it states that
if a man commits kidnapping he is to be imprisoned and pay 15 shekels of silver
which in those days was a lot of money number 16 many ancient Greek
philosophers such as Plato developed the idea using punishment to perform
criminals rather than simply as a method of retribution initially imprisonment
function a penalty for those who cannot afford to
pay fines since many impoverished Athenians could not pay leading to
indefinite periods of imprisonment time limits were eventually set instead which
was that's nicer than I guess number 17 classical Greece and Rome employed the
sporadic use of private prisons called Casa privet us to detain slaves debtors
and those awaiting trial or execution Casa privileges that the named a bit
Kitty's debut happened to snip number 18 the prison in ancient Athens was known
as Desmet Aryan which translates to place of trains literally all these
prisons sound like heavy metal bands number 19 imprisonment with forced labor
on public work projects was a common punishment in ancient Rome in many cases
criminal to a sentence of slavery offered in something known as a gastrula
which was a primitive form of prison in which offenders were chained to benches
and forced to work number 20 T one of the most notable Roman prisons was the
mana time prison established roughly in 640 BCE by ancus marcius the legendary
fourth king of Rome the marmatan prison was situated within a sewer system
beneath the city of Rome and contained a series of dungeons into
which prisoners were lowered and held in exactly the sort condition to expect
from a literal sewer dungeon number 21 jails in the english-speaking world can
be traced at least as far back as the Year 11 66 C II where king henry ii
required that each sheriff establish a county jail in this Shire smart guy
number 22 oh yeah in the 16th and 17th centuries a number of small presents
known as bride Wells were opened in England as part of a move to suppress
vagrancy named after some Brides well in the City of London which was near such a
building these structures were designed to hold petty criminals who were made to
work usually spinning or weaving number 23 the introduction of cellular
confinement was an important step in the development of the modern prison it's
generally believed that the first examples of cellular prisons were
located in what is now Italy in the form of sixteenth and seventeenth-century
institutions like the hospices Sanfilippo in florence and the san
michele hospice in rome number 24 throughout the 18th century english
philanthropist and prison reformer John Howard worked to improve the conditions
in prisons after visiting one in Bedfordshire and finding the pretty dire
environments much the same as in other institutions
Howard's work led to two parliamentary acts one abolish traitors fees and the
other made improvements to the prison system leading to better prisoner health
number 25 in the 19th century the good old US of A took a lead in the creation
of naman prison with the development of two opposing prison models the first was
known as the urban system in which inmates were held in cells at night but
allowed to work and socialize in communal areas during the day the Albarn
system became the most widely used system in the US as it was cheaper to
operate and allow for the use of congregate labor to make money number 26
the second model known as a Pennsylvania system became more common in Europe and
South America and kept inmates in separate cell for 24 hours a day
throughout their entire sentences Wow that's rough this system was favored by
those who promoted the role of solitary confinement as a way to encourage
prisoners to reflect on their past behavior as well as a method of keeping
prisons as safe as possible number 27 the Pennsylvania system was pioneered
and Walnut Street prison in Philadelphia Pennsylvania which operated between 1773
and 1838 the original prison system held little guard for the well-being or
rehabilitation of prisoners as large groups of inmates were housed and dirty
in overcrowded rooms in which violence erupted frequently number 28 in 1790
however the Quakers of Philadelphia introduced the concept of the
penitentiary in which prisoners could reflect on their crimes as a mean of
reform and become Penn tenant lust a penitentiary bit this was achieved with
the establishment of a separate facility at Walnut Street prison Walnut Street -
sounds like a place in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory in which prisoners
were kept in individual cells with very little human contact and no work to
distract them from their intended self-examination number 29 Walnut Street
prison system a separation was further refined at Philadelphia's Eastern State
Penitentiary which exhibited a characteristic wagon wheel design at the
time of its completion the building was the largest and most expensive public
structure ever erected your bet from that camp in the United
States and soon after became the model for more than 300 prisons worldwide
number 30 in the late 18th century the English philosopher and social theorist
Jeremy Bentham designed a form of prison structure known as the panopticon which
sounds like a Transformers villain this is not a Transformers villain even
though it sounds like one but it is an innovative design which are ranged
shells in a circular or semi circular structure with a central tower from
which the guards can observe every single cell the prisoners though can't
see whether or not they're being watched which creates the assumption that
they're potentially under observation at any given time incentivizing or rather
scaring them really into regulating their own behavior number 31 though
there were plans to build a panopticon national penitentiary in Britain various
problems and concerns eventually met the project was abandoned and Bentham never
saw a panopticon built during his lifetime poor Jeremy since his death
though a number of prisons incorporated elements of the panopticon into their
design the most fully realized of which is the Presidium Modelo complex in cuba
which was completed in 1928 and closed in 1967 by which time had become
infamous for overcrowding and riots oh dear that was the opposite of what
Bentham was going for I think number 32 in 1870 more than 130 delegate convened
for the National Prison Congress in Cincinnati Ohio to discuss him define
standards for prison reform the attendees which include the wardens
governor's prison chaplains and judges agreed upon a declaration of principles
which placed emphasis on rehabilitation education and religion to improve the
conditions within an effectiveness of prisons good job number a 33 the 20th
century also saw the rise of Russia's forced labor camp system known in
english as gulags the use of these brutal prisons peaked during Joseph
Stalin's rule between the 1930s and early 1950s and a widely recognized
today is a major instrumental political repression in the Soviet Union by 1980
roughly 99% of all convicted criminals served their time in these labor camps
number 34 early 20th century Britain saw the rise of youth detention centres
called ball stalls named after a prison in the village of borstal near Rochester
in Kent where the first such facility was established
now these institutions claim to reform the most antisocial youths with a focus
on routine discipline and authority but they did gain a fearsome reputation as
hot beds of violence and abuse for this reason bosses were officially abolished
in 1982 number 35 in the 1980s and 90s boot camps and military schools became a
common approach for tackling juvenile delinquency as tough-love programs
emphasizing education exercise and military discipline and once again
became fashionable many young offenders were and continued to be offered such
institutions as an alternative to prison though in some states they can be
sentenced to participate in such programs
number 36 it should be mentioned though that as with borz fools that we
mentioned earlier research has shown that boot camps do not produce
recidivism which is a fancy word for basically going back to do more crime
producing only short-term changes in attitude and behavior the use of boot
camps and military schools remains controversial as like many other harsh
you've just systems they have a reputation for
bullying and abuse number thirty-seven across the globe more than ten million
people are currently in prison which equates to little more than the entire
population of Sweden that's not to say that the entire population of Sweden are
in prison unless Sweden itself is one big prison like Pascal Sauvage didn't
Johnny English Oh number 38 worldwide approximately 700
thousand women and girls are in prison meaning that about 93% of all the prison
people and then yay women I mean not on them Pro Crime kind of way but you know
what I mean number 39 apparently though it's not
entirely our fault fellas that we get banged up so often as apparently in
criminology there is a known institutional bias against men in the
criminal justice system which has been confirmed in several studies for example
from the University of Michigan men routinely received longer sentences the
women who is significantly more likely to avoid charges and convictions
altogether even when they are convicted women incarcerated at roughly half the
rate that men are number 40 by far the most prison happy nation on earth is
drumroll please but it's the United States with incarceration rates of
roughly one in every 107 people America imprisons its citizens at rates of
exceed even countries suffering with war or authoritarian political regimes
number 41 this translate to the staggering figure that approximately 2.3
million Americans are behind bars right now which constitutes the largest prison
population on earth the meaning of life as a result even
though the u.s. is home to less than 5% of the global population America's
prison population accounts of roughly 25 percent of prisoners world wide number
43 in case you were wondering by the way the current prison capital of the world
is the u.s. state of Oklahoma with an incarceration rates of 1709 prisoners
per 100,000 people that's that's a lot of people behind bars guys a lot number
44 another depressing statistic for you now
that states that since the 1980s the US prison population has more than
quadrupled quadrupled I say number 45 you may be thinking but sham why why
does this happen and well the reasons why the United States is imprisoned so
many people in recent years is multifaceted and frankly extremely
complicated two common explanations refer to increased sentence lengths and
the so-called war on drugs however many experts are beginning
to suggest that the main cause of America's unprecedented incarceration
rate is simply a generally more punitive approach to criminal justice compared to
previous decades leading to longer sentences compared to the rest of the
world and an increased tendency to charge people with felonies
number 46 there are over 5,000 jails and prisons in the u.s. to get a scale of
exactly what that means there are more jails in United States and there are
colleges number 47 the average annual cost of representing one inmate in a
federal prison is somewhere around $30,000 I have it on good authority that
that's enough to punch is quite a large number of processed chicken pieces
number 48 similarly state spending on Corrections
has ballooned by about 300 percent in the past two decades god that fact is
depressing but at least I got to use the word ballooned small victories a number
49 depending on who you ask the cost of incarceration for the
American taxpayer varies pretty significantly between seventy billion
dollars and 182 billion dollars annually without a lot of money just imagine how
many chicken nuggets we could all buy too bad it's all going on putting people
in prison well number 50 despite having by far the highest incarceration rate in
the world right now America's incarceration rate is actually at a two
decade low hots got a sting number 51 asked the u.s. the countries with the
most imprison people are China Brazil Russia and India case you were wondering
number 52 collectively England and Wales have the highest imprisonment rate in
Western Europe with roughly 149 people per 100,000 of the population behind
bars well at least with the rest of something number 53 meanwhile countries
like the Netherlands are actually closing prisons due to a lack of
prisoners all right guys so did you show off is there number 54 today most
prisons are surrounded by walls fencing geographical features and many other
barriers to prevent chances from attempting to leave prison before they
get their full dose of justice additional security measures often
include concertina wire and that provide fencing armed guards house security
lighting motion sensors trained dogs and roving patrols depending on each
facility's level of security number 55 in the 19th century in English convict
named Joseph police though Jones was transported to the British penal colony
of Western Australia where he gained a reputation for escaping from prison on
numerous occasions Jones who was commonly known as moon
Joe was eventually placed in an escape-proof cell built specifically for
him using concrete and railroad sleepers of course he escaped that too and was
free for two years before being recaptured number 57 if the idea of
escaping from prison using a helicopter sounds far-fetched to you you may be
surprised to hear that helicopter prison escapes Antley happen often enough to
warrant an entire wikipedia page devoted to the subject
whirlybird jailbreak state back to the early 1970s and succeeds surprisingly
often resulting in the liberation of drug lords gangsters and IRA members
number 58 in case you were wondering and I know you were your little tyke the
country that's hosted war recorded helicopter escapes attempts and any
other country is France with at least eleven this is in part due to the
exploits of rogues like Pascal Paille who has managed to use helicopters to
escape from prison on no less than three occasions number 59 in some countries
such as Mexico and Germany the act of escaping from prison is not an illegal
act because their laws recognized that all people have a fundamental desire to
be free as such escapees who are recaptured do not have any extra time
added to their sentences for skedaddling sounds good right number 60 except that
they almost certainly will have their sentences lengthened because there are a
few important terms and conditions through the company these loopholes in
many of these nations if a prisoner breaks any other laws in the course
their escape such as damaging the prison itself the individual is still culpable
of those crimes even if a prisoner doesn't smash a window or break through
a fence during their prefer freedom escaping while wearing prison clothing
constitutes theft the obvious answer therefore is to escape while completely
naked thank you for coming to my TED talk number 61 in many of the numerous
countries which retain the death penalty's our former punishments
prisoners awaiting execution often housed in the special section of the
prison generally known as death row the term is also used in a figurative sense
for condemned prisoners even in prisons without a separate death row area number
62 it's customary for condemned inmates to receive their last meal which as you
are probably already aware is a final meal of the prisoners choice before
execution in most American states such as Texas for example last meals are
limited to a monetary value of no more than twenty dollars however in other
states such as Florida and Indiana last meals are limited to forty dollars while
the sunny state of California indulges its death row inmates with last meals
worth up to fifty dollars number 63 in the United States and Canada Britain
is you misbehave or sometimes served a meal known as natural loaf which usually
consists of a blender concoction of leftovers made into a solid loaf
naturally I've contained all the nutrients and vitamins necessary to
constitute a healthy diet but has a deliberately unappetizing taste
sometimes had to resemble that of cardboard and I'm eating cardboard it's
not nice many argue that serving deliberately unpleasant food to
prisoners it's unethical while others say that natural Oh significantly
reduces violence nintendo64 somewhat unsurprisingly everyone's favorite
religion Scientology has it's very own prison ominously nicknamed the hole
despite insistence by Scientology officials that the hole doesn't exist
numerous people have given accounts of the facility where high-ranking members
deemed to have fallen short of expectations are held for months or even
years number 65 some prisons in Brazil offer inmates a chance to reduce their
sentences by reading books and writing corresponding essays prisoners
participating in the redemption through reading program can have four days
removed from their prison stays for every book they read up to 48 days a
year number 66 another prison in southeastern
Brazil gives him mates the chance to reduce their sentences by sitting on
stationary bicycles hooked up to car batteries and pedaling like there's no
tomorrow hmm that sounds familiar to me Charlie
Brooker the batteries are then used to power street lights in a nearby town
number 67 the longest sentence ever requested is thought to have been
leveled against the man from the Spanish island of Majorca in 1972
Gabriel March grana das was a postman in the islands capital city Palmer who was
accused of failing to deliver forty two thousand seven hundred and sixty eight
letters from which he pickpocketed and he enclosed valuables Oh Gabriel
prosecutors wanted to have him serve nine years Peron delivered letter which
works out at a frankly hilarious 384 thousand nine hundred twelve years in
prison ultimately though grana das was sentenced at the somewhat more
reasonable straight to fourteen years in two months
number 68 the longest prison term that was actually handed down to someone is
thought to have been given to Thailand made chamoy IPO so the wife of a
high-ranking officer in the Thai Air Force over the course of two decades
that BSO operated a Ponzi scheme that scammed over 16,000 people out of a
total of 8 million baht which I assume is a lot tibi so was ultimately
sentenced to spend one hundred to forty one thousand and seventy eight years in
prison but for some reason was released after only eight victims were never
compensated number 69 place of chains in 1979
computer hacker kevin Mitnick broke into the computer network of Digital
Equipment Corporation and copied their software a crime of which he was
convicted almost a decade later in 1988 after a short stint in prison
Mitnick hacked into the Pacific Bell Telephone Company for which he was
dramatically pursued by police for years before being apprehended in 1995 Mick
dick skills as a hacker was so overblown that it was rumored he could start a
nuclear war by whistling into a telephone and as such he spent much of
his time in prison in solitary confinement number 70 AD the DeCoteau
correctional facility in Illinois incarcerated women are allowed to keep
their babies with them in prison after two years these absolute mothers had an
almost zero percent recidivism rate compared to the same one average of over
50 percent number 71 in China many wealthy people who commit crimes higher
body doubles to stand trial and serve their prison sentences the practice is
so common it even has a name ding zuy which roughly translates to substitute
criminal number 72 surprisingly Wow my voice there people aged 60 and over
are the fastest-growing age group in the American prison system between 200 - and
201 five the number of sentence prisoners aged 16 over rose by
staggering 164 percent number 73 a prison in the u.s. state of Indiana
allows murderers to adopt cats and keep them in cells the program which has been
linked to better inmate behavior has been running for 20 years and is so
popular that there's even a waiting list to adopt one of the 75 cats who call the
prison their home number 74 though controversial it's been shown the
providing inmates with access to television is a much cheaper way of
keeping them quiet and subdued than it would be to hire more guards number 75
since 1999 several companies in America outsource call center duties to prisons
the presidency may be drug dealers prostitutes or murderers can generate
savings that would be waiting for them upon release programs like this have
proved controversial with many claiming that they take jobs away from
law-abiding citizens number 76 during the 20th century prison inmates
throughout the aforementioned cool acts of the Soviet Union maintained a tattoo
culture which was used to indicate one's criminal career and ranking the tattoos
themselves have symbolic meanings for instance skulls represent murderers
while religious I could three of the Orthodox Church and
somewhat bizarrely cats are used to indicate thieves number 75 arguably the
most infamous prison in histories Alcatraz federal penitentiary often
known simply as Alcatraz or the rock it was located on the island of who guessed
it Alcatraz which sits in the San Francisco Bay approximately two
kilometers offshore from the city of San Francisco California in the United
States prior to the notorious prison the island was also home to a lighthouse a
military fortification and a military prison it since become a popular tourist
destination which was in roughly 1.5 million visitors a year who can leave of
their own accord number 78 Spanish explorers discovered the island in 1775
and named it home la la de los Alcatraz's which roughly translates to
island of the pelicans or island of the gannets this is due to the number of
seabirds which lived there at the time before they were driven away by human
activity number 79 many of the actual buildings of the island were built in
the decades before the prison opened in 1934 including a hospital and a mess
hall a new cell house measuring approximately 150 meters in length
was completed in 1912 and was said to be the longest concrete building in the
world at the time number 80 Alcatraz was used to house some of the nation's more
dangerous criminals who often caused trouble at other prisons the average
inmate had a sentence between 20 to 25 years and would span between six to
eight of those years at Alcatraz before they were considered reformed enough to
be sent back to another prison number 81 the Alcatraz federal penitentiary was in
operation for almost three decades before it was finally closed on the 21st
of March 1963 during this time the infamous prison house numerous
high-profile criminals including the likes of Machine Gun Kelly Mickey Cohen
whitey bulger Alvin creepy Karpis and the notorious gangster Al Capone who was
moved there as his mental health slowly declined from the effects of syphilis
far safe number 82 another notable inmate at the rock was Robert Stroud aka
the Birdman of Alcatraz Stroud was a convicted murderer who'd become an avid
bird keeper and respected ornithologist while serving time at a previous prison
where he kept hundreds of Canaries and contributed to the academic
understanding of the species his reputation both is in all of the file
and psychopath followed him to Alcatraz where he was imprisoned for 17 years
number 83 Alcatraz has also hosted over a dozen escape attempts such as the
violent Prison Break known today as the battle for Alcatraz in which six inmate
attempted to free themselves by stealing weapons from a poorly protected gun
gallery and taking a number of guards hostage for several hours between the
2nd and 4th of May 1946 the belligerent prisoners exchanged gunfire with
remaining guards until the cellblock was finally stormed by Marines under a hail
of grenades and rifle bangs number 84 three of the six would-be escapees were
killed at the battle Alcatraz while in another two were ultimately executed at
st. Quentin State Prison the final conspirator was sentenced to
an additional 99 years in jail though he was finally released 27 years later two
guards were also killed during the attempted breakout which constituted the
bloodiest episode of the prison's history number 85 a few years later on
the 11th of June 1962 three inmates by the name of Frank Morris John Anglin and
Clarence Anglin managed to escape their island prison on Alcatraz over the
course of six months the intrepid trio had used improvised tool to chisel away
at the salt damaged concrete of their cells into an unguarded three foot wide
utility corridor the team used paint and cardboard to hide their progress and
disguise the noise by playing the accordion Wow
not kidding number 86 on the night of the escape the three prisoners crawled
through a hole in their cell wall climbed up a network of piles of the
prison roof then descended a 15 meter wall by sliding down a kitchen bent pipe
to the ground from there the trio inflated a raft made of more than 50
raincoats using a small concertina as a bellows they then disappeared into the
fog of the San Francisco Bay never to be seen again number 87 the prison guards
didn't realize the inmates were missing until the next morning when they
discovered the vacant beds contain nothing but bedsheets bunched up into
the shape of a person and eerily realistic paper mache heads made of real
hair and closed painted eyes though the official determination was that the
three men drowned numerous sources have conceded that it's not impossible that
the men survived number 88 only a few months later after the most
famous Alcatraz escape another inmate John Paul Scott again proved that
escaping the infamous prison was at least theoretically possible on the 16th
of December 1962 John Paul Scott and Dahl Parker squeezed through a window
and swam into the San Francisco Bay wall Parker was caught on the rocky outcrop
known as this allow Petrus Scott was found by a group at the foot of the
Golden Gate Ridge unconscious and suffering from
hypothermia though his escape was ultimately unsuccessful Scott is the
only known person to have escaped Alcatraz alive
number 89 in some kind of sarcastic mockery the prison's former security
staff a triathlon in touch with the Escape from Alcatraz triathlon is held
every year to prove that it's possible to swim from Alcatraz and live in
addition to the one and a half mile swim to San Francisco the event also includes
an 18 mile bike ride and an eight mile run number 19
interestingly Alcatraz was once the only federal penitentiary in the US that
provided hot showers for its inmates this was based on the belief that
inmates who released a nice warm water would not be able to withstand the
freezing San Francisco Bay during an escape attempt also probably didn't help
that these people had been locked in cages for years on end number 91 well
our trial developed a fearsome reputation in its time it apparently
wasn't quite the hellhole it's often made out to be many inmates for example
appreciated the large ratio of guards and the one man once held policy which
made one less vulnerable to attack from disgruntled prison mates number 92 not
only that James a Johnston the first warden of Alcatraz knew that low-quality
food would often cause the prison riots so he made sure that the inmates have
served good food of which multiple helpings were allowed many prisoners
considered the conditions inside Alcatraz to be relatively desirable and
several inmates actually requested to be transferred there number 93 somewhat
surprisingly during its time as a prison the guards and officers of Alcatraz
lived on the island with their spouses and children at any given time roughly
300 civilians lived across three apartment buildings one large duplex and
four large wooden houses for the senior officers they had access to a small
convenience store a soda fountain shop and their own bowling alley
there's even an Alumni Association for people who grew up on that Island number
94 another infamous American prison is the maximum-security correction facility
in New York State there's two sobbingly known as Sing Sing the name of the
prison is derived from the sink sink band of weapons and Native Americans who
originally inhabited the area nominally five Sing Sing cellblock a is the
largest prison cell block in the world the second largest is Sing Sing
cellblock B it's a big prison basically number 96 in the 1920s and 30s the New
York Yankees would play exhibition games against the Sing Sing prison a team who
are known as the black Shi hello again friend of a friend I knew
you will forget that reference you're a winner number 97
sing-sing state prison is located 30 miles north of New York City on the east
bank of the Hudson River which gave rise to the phrase up the river which is a
popular American slang term for being sent to prison I'll never do that again
I'm sorry number 98 today one of the most notorious prison facilities in the
United States is San Quentin prison in California San Quentin actually predates
an out lives nearby Alcatraz having open in 1852 making it the oldest prison in
California prides of the 1940s the prison house inmates in substandard and
violent conditions which often included head shavings and irregular meals as
punishment number 99 San Quentin currently holds the largest
number of death row inmates in the USA with 746 condemned killers residing in
the facility this is more than twice the number of death row prisoners in the
second-ranked state of Florida which is home to 347 people currently awaiting an
end to their life number 100 less depressing Lee San Quentin prison is one
of the few inmate run newspapers in the world titled the San Quentin news which
even has its own website and Twitter accounts number 101 not only that San
Quentin prison was also home to the very first meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous in
a prison since then hundreds of other AAA groups have been set up behind
prison walls and that can only be a good thing so that was 101 fact about prisons
did you learn anything new have we missed any daring escapes out let us
