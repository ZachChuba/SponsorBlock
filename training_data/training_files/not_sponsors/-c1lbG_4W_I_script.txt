platform to build a beautiful online presence the times were changing the world was changing powerful men were being toppled their misdeeds exposed one second you are on top of the world in the next hashtag me dude but what about for the good guys the ones just trying to do the right thing had the game changed for them to forgive please forgive me look I know it's easy to feel paranoid about all this stuff so let's talk about it and to start things off I think that if this is something you're worried about you're probably on the right path you care about other people and their feelings and in my experience there isn't really much of a gray area here you have guys who are trying to do right by women and then and then you have everybody else the creeps the middle ground is very small non-existent on the one hand I want to treat women with tiny same respect but on the other there so why does no one understand how difficult this is so across the bear dude what like for example catcalling I really can't believe catcalling is an actual thing some guys do I don't exist in the universe where that is a reasonable life decision to make but apparently others do so I've just had to make my peace with the fact that other people live in a very different reality than I do I can't help the cat callers they're probably hopeless okay you understand that when and when you make that sound you sounds like an animal it's like a mating call dude I just call it like okay let me pray this way do you love your mom I love my mom seriously okay so imagine if someone did that to your mom oh dude that is disgusting exactly and why is that gusting because my mom is not hot you're a sicko Oh the problem is we all kind of get lumped in with these gentlemen even though a lot of us out there cannot even fathom a situation so desperate that we would treat a woman like this I'm going to murder your entire family unless you objectify this woman verbally right now [Music] I'm sorry I can't do it I can't do it get my family what here's the thing I think the more things change the more things stay the same I think that those of us who worry about treating others in a respectful way while we're getting the last laugh and sure as the saying goes nice guys finish last we've all heard it but remember what Jesus himself once said the last shall be first and the first shall be last this was Jesus way of saying that the hot guys in high school will eventually get old and fat and have a crippling midlife crisis what I'm saying is eventually things work out for the good guys you shouldn't be a good guy for this reason but I'm just saying it might be fun in the very very short term to you know get with the pros and create a computer program where you rate one girl to another girl and say which one is hot or not Zuckerberg right evil you're you know who you are whatever this is not a world I know what in the long term I promise it's cool to be a good guy super cool yo yo yo we're the good boys and we're here to say it's super hip when you treat girls appropriately when you treat a girl like me a party you die to respect passes I think all it really takes to avoid being a creep is three simple ideas number one just be her friend she's probably got guys hitting on her left and right all day every single day in this crazy mixed-up world just give her a break don't assume she's interested make friends not love number two don't objectify her yes girls are pretty very attractive to the eye and it's okay to recognize those things in a healthy way saying something like this wow you look really nice seeing is very different than this I'm sorry I just I I have to say this you are adorable II pretty I had to say it no I sorry I just I restart thought-form has five minutes to say everything again and finally number three treat her like you want to be treated pretty self-explanatory when you're interacting with a girl thinks to yourself would I want to be treated this way yes I would make out with me I trust you know what I mean by this please please know what I mean by this stay tuned for bloopers guys I know you of a website or domain that squarespace.com slash cow super cool yo yo yo we're the good boys and we're here to say it's super hip when you treat girls appropriately [Music] it ain't fly when a guy objectifies when you treat a girl like meet a party you dies I'm probably too close to the mic let me do one more going to treat a girl like me a part of you dies [Laughter]
