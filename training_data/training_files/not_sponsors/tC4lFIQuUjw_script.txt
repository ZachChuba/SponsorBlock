strange device the only word that comes to mind is ball despite your reservations curiosity gets the better of you you progress deeper into the earth as the air becomes stagnant and hot oztak one you find yourself going farther the caverns widen in the distance stands a derelict pyramid using the ball you have no choice but to solve another set of elaborate puzzles is here where things get progressively worse inexplicably you realize that you have now con and with the reinanimated bones of monkeys yeah [ __ ] i'm down with it you gotta find your friend and platonically handshake him tomorrow say it the ball yes yeah the voice actor said it pico de gallo mexico 1940. this looks [ __ ] great looks similar to the other ball game so far are you going to get the lights yes i want to get immersed in the ball tomar once again has turned on the dark thank you i only speak in affirmatives chris little people yes are you all right that was quite a fall you took i laughed a lot but now i'm concerned i thought you were doing a bit you're doing a bit by ragdolling explore the area that's a really bad idea if you are it was a good one you should have said stay put we'll try to find a rope what a [ __ ] just walk around down there maybe you won't die put on here put on your indiana jones hat it won't let me pull it from under the door control his jump what the [ __ ] shift is crowd oh you this is already a broken game no this is a good game chris keep going keep going [Applause] ah this is his fault he told me to wander your guy cannot stop falling you can press h any time during the game to display a help message i'll only do that if necessary which help message well let's try it thank you thank you please beat the ball oh [ __ ] it's the giant ancient slingshot that's meant to fire the ball what the [ __ ] all right uh hold left it's called the hammer hammer hit the little blue button it is jerking itself off now what oh whoa okay what does that mean i don't know does anybody else know about this game i've never heard of this i don't know the ball someone made it the person who made this and his parents know about this game that's fair what's this um am i [ __ ] am i done no it said to hit the little blue uh signal with the hammer oh there you go wow look at that it was a little bit interesting of a choice to have a weapon like this on one of those games where if you get closer to a wall like the perspective on your gun gets [ __ ] oh i love that oh yeah i'm a little man wow okay wait are you yeah you are i mean this is just a giant [ __ ] door the ball the titular balls oh i love when things get titular give it to me whoa what what the [ __ ] wow oh holding the right mouse okay the ball will come to halt in front of you this is a weird little game and pressing holding q to make the ball temporarily transparent oh it's very quick there goes the ball why didn't they just design a transparent ball well like a crystal like a big christmas like it just had like a basic frame but it was otherwise look just like that yeah that'd be that'd be good and you know what it would be better also if you were like a little glove and then you could turn the ball into different types of balls maybe bounce the ball is that a reference to glover i [ __ ] know it i like the clan you know it honey holes wait have you not played it on like this channel oh i've never even seen what it is it's uh i don't know the monopoly on glover references i don't know if it was actually good or if i just [ __ ] like played it as a dumb kid but i i liked it at the time it was [ __ ] hard though i solved this puzzle you solved this puzzle evidently i'm really clever you know they probably should have put that button on like the right or left wall so i didn't accidentally hit it there you go come here you that's not a bad mechanic as far as mechanics go i'm happy so far yeah no ball has been uh anytime we roll the dice on a ball game it turns out good for us those spiders just fly what yeah they were on the camera which i guess exists in physical space okay i say we do an oni where skunk works game that's just called the land a ball you're being a ballist a ball ham lincoln almost a ballist man i know you could be a ball ham lincoln and abolish slavery and then they would all have a ball with their new freedom monkey what this is a good game monkey is happy about the ball monkey take care surrounded by little crackers monkey ate a bunch of meth by accident and now it's very itchy are you my friend oh my god what do you do don't crush that monkey with the ball stop moving can you hit it with the hammer don't hammer his skull in don't ever think of doing stop flying i can't believe this oh my god i hate this game it was it was by your own actions that monkey met it's you know i would never [ __ ] do that unless severely depressed then my eyes deceived me i guess maybe there's more monkeys what for you to for you to eradicate i don't want to do no he's got to make amends each subsequent monkey he has to help let me out of here damn it area complete there goes the bravest ball i've ever met the bravest well i'm having a good time yeah that's exactly what what i would say about this game tonight i'm gonna have a good time that's not how it goes what i'm gonna have myself a good time i'm having a ball push that their ball go ball go go go what no oh i guess i guess you just want to stand on it yourself and then pull the ball off yeah oh okay um okay all kind of [ __ ] sleeper kicks ass now what do i do i have to get over there do you shoot the ball at that yeah you should be able to get there you get that big cool olmec head yeah grab that grab that [ __ ] uh or hecatol that was a secret no that's that uh that's zardos dude oh is that what that character is called did i [ __ ] that up the gun is good ass what's that from the gun is good [Music] it's a [ __ ] old movie oh the the with the [ __ ] what's his name in the speedo where they have the gun cult whatever guarantee you if i google this oh it was sean connery yeah it makes more sense damn was that little thing not something you could land on the ball that little protrusion kind of i think i just overshot it i'm sorry i'm going [ __ ] nuts with zardos this thing czar does i've i know i've never never seen this no monkey you have to spare these yeah you have to make amends for what you did to their brothers to be fair in fact if you can help these monkeys find food and a new place to live i think you should they look even more sad than the monkeys on youtube that get like thrown around by their own parents monkey king popo didn't we find a video of a monkey that he was literally getting dragged around so much that he just [ __ ] dies halfway through the video monkey videos are like evil yeah they're sad a lot of the time i've come to learn the monkeys probably have the worst lives of any creatures they're [ __ ] evil sometimes they're little bastards they'll like just eat each other they don't even give a [ __ ] especially the ones in thailand i actually don't feel bad about that one you just killed he was probably gonna do some horrible [ __ ] he was probably gonna drag the other one around by the tail and kill it by sheer friction on the ground these guys seem to be getting along just fine careful little monkey okay i think you i think you did that i might think you're fine genius so that's open now it seems like everything chris theory is chris a genius yes yes yes wow magma schmidt is that thing on the right a button why would you what i just wanted to see what happened oh you clipped through it and death it broke the illusion in life i was above oh back here that's [ __ ] horseshit no wonder nobody played this that's not the end of the world you're right here it looks like they already everything you [ __ ] well you're officially a money a mass murderer of monkeys yeah one monkey death is an accident two monkey deaths is more than a coincidence he never did me no favors get that [ __ ] yeah wow now it's just a further fall to your death whoa were spikes ever really used in history or is that just something that like video games i i pretty sure they were at the very least they were used in vietnam really you know about the vietnamese oh yeah no that's true you're right they'd cut bamboo spikes and bury it under like a pile of leaves and covered in in human feces so it would cause a horrible infection yeah i guess i guess spikes would be a good idea what was their problem huh uh they were at war oh yeah they wanted to kill people oh yeah if if i was at war i would actually make that point and i think that the other side would probably acknowledge it if you were just like dude what's your problem we're at war yeah dude come on and then they were they would lay down their arms i did it i did it i did it you sure did what i don't know what you did but i'm really good at it whoa it did man get out of the way ball i want to see i want to see this blue guy oh he's blue yeah he's color he's he's awful leathery yeah you could you could grab his [ __ ] chest medallion just take it back up to that dude and sell it i'm honestly stupid not to yeah that guy's honestly stupid do not have to go down that way where he was no i gotta go back this way okay i should have given you a ladder or something got to bring the ball remember you're going to show up with that thing and that dude's going to freak out oh what oh come here ball no no [ __ ] well there we go over there there's adventures to be had yeah his clips play over each other place the ball in the block in the corner to press e hm move the ball to pull the block away press e again to disconnect it what oh so the ball can be attached to this ah this game rocks honestly that's so cool when did this come out uh i think it said 2010 is it really that old yeah actually looks pretty good if it's considering it's from 2010 i'll bet some studio that like doesn't exist anymore made this can you open the door and any can you use the ball to open the door can you stick the ball to the door and use the ball to open the door is there a thing you're supposed to drag that block onto that's what i'd assume oh oh what i don't know what you just saw was there a switch there or something i guess okay i didn't see it either that or maybe just because that thing was close enough to it it didn't register that oh this is like portal now this is a new shape i [ __ ] hate this that looks like you can hammer it this isn't round at all i think that's what they're trying to tell you hammer it into the wall no i think you hammer it into those slots that are shaped just like it oh wouldn't that be nice the smartest of the group i mean i i i passed shapeology as a toddler so she apology shapeology yeah there's like a whole hole and you have to identify the hole with the shape that goes in it and uh i have a shape iq of 196. so something is scaring me okay get out of here is this the scariest game i've ever played europe no would you ever find a place to actually put that there's four of them yeah there's a bunch oh keep up too much [ __ ] hard dude wait that's stuck like that did that work that looks like it worked supposedly the light went off on it so there's one down there and there's probably one up here uh there's two down there and there's a a big fan is that like is that like a murder oh that's so cool actually you've got moon boots son finally moonbolts to call my out oh no it's like a hockey table this is bad oh yeah it's air hockey get out of here i can do it yeah god i'm good no i'm bad get down get out oh i thought i really got it there's got it come on yes yay we should get a hammer gun with a skull on it yeah i i think it would spice up this channel a lot well now i have a good idea for a christmas gift it'll spice up our sex lives our family lives our uh our work lives yeah [ __ ] it would shut my uncle up thanksgiving uh i don't think you should hate your uncle dude no he would just see it and he would think it was cool and then he'd shut up i know your uncle is one of those horrible horrible racists but i still don't think we should hit him fine uncle albert is the most horrible man of the united states that is the family name just about every other guy in his family has the word lyle somewhere in their name uncle lil bird is actually legally dead we can't disclose that he uh he didn't die last year because oh otherwise the people will come after him check this out your best friend why did that happen oh [ __ ] i wanted to separate you from your uh your sense of comfort but i want my ball i'm never going to see it it's 500 meters away now you can't be thinking like that chris you got to keep a positive oh god wait my balls that far away yeah now a [ __ ] thing just swam up your dick oh my god you're right i'm i'm in this place the mighty candy roo you are i think you are in south america or mexico or something that looks like a great picture if this place doesn't have dick fish i don't know where it would my ball was surely supposed to come down with me right you think i think it was intentionally not supposed to hit that and you hit oh my jesus that was a [ __ ] ball scare where'd it come from that was a ball scare you got balls scared go why won't you hey it's just being funky there you go you got funky balls boy i can't believe we got scared by a big stupid ball oh monkeys monkeys killed as an objective oh good let's kill all the monkeys or at least it keeps track but maybe the amount of monkeys you kill is the amount of like giant evil apes that will attack you at the end of the game during the the end segment it looks like it was like a collectible like monkey's killed you can't escape monkey ah this place rocks i can't wait to go to south america and have fun with the ball hey who said that wasn't it supposedly like the aztecs that did invent some of the like earliest ball sports really oh yeah it was in the road tailed the race i was gonna say yeah they made a point of doing like a pseudo basketball in roe del dorado i too get my uh get my history from animated dreamworks movies don't we all that's how i know that the red sea really parted if i was moses i would have kept them as two seeds and then i would have two christmases two jewish christmases come here bowl come here ball
