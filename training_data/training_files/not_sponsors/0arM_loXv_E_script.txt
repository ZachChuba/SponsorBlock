these are things you're only gonna see once in your lifetime a one-in-a-million coincidence check it out guys we got this crab right here and it changes color when you pour water on it I've never seen a crab change color to so many different colors it's off with the red went to pink now to purple and is it gonna get too blue dark purple and oh it is it's blue down that is amazing I've never seen anything like it do you guys know what this is called if you do let me know in the comments I thought crowds were just always red maybe I'm wrong welcome to reaction time if you're new I'm telling the host if you guys don't follow me on the social zapped all fishman it's gonna be right here and Twitter this one was highly requested a one-in-a-million coincidence things you only see once in your lifetime imagine you're sitting at a soccer game only to accidentally go on mmm tinder yeah that's right you're just a single man trying to find the right one little did you know the girl you were about to swipe on is sitting right in front of you not only that she's sitting next to her boyfriend that's right on a faithful little girl oh what a shame well luckily for that guy he spotted her on site now this one is gonna be a little interesting that's sorry these are chickens who are crossing not the road but an electrical line it's actually too dangerous but they're not getting electrocuted I'm not sure how this is possible but good for them I'm very scared that maybe they will have been no no fried chicken today well these chickens are actually oh how do you get I didn't even know chickens I thought chickens were supposed to be on the ground if they ask thing call electrocuted that would be horrifying well luckily for us that didn't happen gotta love your chickens look what we got here we got a four-leaf clover but that's not the cool thing the cool thing is that a blind boy found a four-leaf clover now normal people can't find four-leaf clovers this blind boy found it is it luck or does he have some sort of sense that we don't that is astonishing a one-in-a-million chance maybe one in a billion that he would find this four-leaf clover as a blind kid can you imagine that he had to touch every single clover every single one of these just to sense the one that is four leaves this kid really has luck on the side now what do we have next we got a tattoo of a dragonfly pretty cool tattoo on your foot if he has no a dragonfly symbolizes put it down in the comments but the interesting thing is that there was a dragonfly that landed on the foot that looked exactly the same that's right this dragonfly is actually almost a mirror image of the tattooed dragonfly now the giant fly probably thought that was another dragonfly but it was deceived also what are the odds of this having the same color scheme as the tattoo it's absolutely incredible this will only happen once in your lifetime guaranteed okay let's just say you parked your car in the right spot next to the right tree the tree actually curved in such a way that it did not leave a scratch in your car when it collapsed Lord it's a miracle it actually looks like it complete conform to the way your car shaped now that's some good savings from a lot of damage you got lucky or maybe it just chance all right how about this moment where you took a picture of your friend blowing up a balloon only to get the exact but second that it popped now you can see what the point of weakness in the balloon was which is right here at the top that's where I popped what an amazing coincidence next up guys do you remember those chickens well they found a new spot these are chickens on trees like a lot of chickens I don't know where this is but I don't even know chickens hung out on trees I thought that was what monkeys are meant to do but I guess these chickens found a new home maybe they should want some shelter it was raining or something and being inside the tree helped them or maybe there was some sort of predator down there they had to climb the tree quick and they got it he's just so weird just like all their and they all look the same too what a weird coincidence okay next up we got a Pepsi and I actually exploded in the refrigerator while someone took a picture picture of course freezes time and therefore you see this amazing almost art like photography it's a Pepsi swirl and it's diet diced ography don't you diet just don't drink Pepsi actually if it explodes please stop it that is not funny someone dropped a keychain only to find out the keychain fell exactly in this screw what are the odds of this I would say zero to none that is incredible and they take a picture of it next up this guy is trying to pull out of sewer oh it might be like it may be like a snake or something so be careful I don't know maybe he caught it from the tail but yeah he just pulled it out something got stuck in there and is that sounds chicken what are you a puppy just by pure chance someone heard the puppy go into the drain and he was able to pull it out what a hero guys look at this puppy so adorable oh my god he's so scared feel so bad but they're able to save him no selfies on the always you know lifetime I posted to pick up my intro and the puppy gets stuck in a drain a little pipe next up whoa check tell me which one's your favorite and let's go back to the video let's go we got a carrot I grew into another care or kind of hugged it wrapped around another carrots one is perfectly straight and thick one is perfectly straight and thick another one it's thin and scared it looks like a baby's holding on to his father just because they saw a monster what do you guys think about this we're the odds we got Timmy looking at his Timmy Jimmy no you won't see this every day you wear the exact same thing kind of similar hairstyle and you look a little cynical at least you know the cat is getting the right nutrients if the exact same cat is on the packaging maybe it's meant for it you know when you have an alter ego that's right at Batman this is what happens when you accidentally open an M&M packet at the perfect spot to accidentally create two personalities from one mmm if you connect them let's just connect them right now I was yes conceit that's what it looked like normally you had a small smirk but when you take them apart again one is this face and other one is this not I guarantee you if you tried if you tried doing it again it's gonna be extremely difficult but you got it rest in peace all this it's a coffee tear girl it took a selfie and as you can see there's a small rainbow and also lightning lightning strike at the exact time she took herself then this should go viral when it's a little too moist in your house you might start growing some mushrooms it's a little disgusting fungi - mushrooms grew behind some furniture ill next please a laughing onion yeah that's the face you're gonna make when you tear up from all the cutting have sensitive eyes always tear up it's so horrible this onion just laughing in your misery whenever you tear up like yeah I make people cry for no reason no one of both lines that McDonald's have the exact same cars lined up at the exact same time at the same McDonald's location with the exact same model and year a week now this might not be a coincidence or it is is that Harry Potter Ron forgot her name what's her name I'm Annie Granger an apple way keeps the doctor wait why don't I just say an apple a day keeps the doctor away what about this Apple that has no color and look at the inside
