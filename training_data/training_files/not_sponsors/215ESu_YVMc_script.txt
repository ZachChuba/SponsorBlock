run your business [Music] what do you think of when you think of Antarctica ice penguins David Attenborough talking about ice and penguins but Antarctica isn't just a penguin paradise it's also a haven for astronomy and for weirdly some of the same reasons the cold keeps the air crystal clear a lot of the time and reduces thermal interference which is exactly what many telescopes need and dark toukas isolation also means the skies are some of the darkest on earth and its position at the South Pole means that there can be months of continuous darkness exactly what astronomers want if they're looking at something faint astronomers and physicists have even figured out a way of using the ice itself as a giant observatory and as a window into the solar system's ancient history the only downside of astronomy in Antarctica is that like it's Antarctica but Hardy scientists and hearty instruments mean that that's not as much of a barrier as you might think and to prove it here are five reasons why Antarctica is the place to be when you want to study space if you've ever thought that astronomers spend too much time looking up well the IceCube neutrino Observatory is for you they do astronomy and physics by staring down into ice near the South Pole is pretty much the only place on earth where you will find huge slow-moving expanses of ice that don't melt not completely that is Ice Cube stares into a cubic kilometer of ice near the South Pole in order to studied neutrinos which are fast-moving elusive incredibly tiny subatomic particles that we mostly understand except for a bunch of stuff that we're still trying to learn about them and neutrinos will pass through just about anything without bumping into them like a trillion go through your nose every second which makes them incredibly difficult to study in a laboratory seeing the unlucky few that happened to bump into something generally requires building giant detectors but in 1999 a team of scientists pointed out that they could just use the Antarctic Ice Sheet as one giant neutrino target which led to the development of the IceCube project si neutrino detectors don't need to be made of anything special but they do need to be pretty big and pretty see-through like a giant ice sheets most neutrinos will actually pass right through the ice but every once in a while one crashes into a water molecule and that collision sets off a chain reaction that eventually releases light that ice cubes detectors can see but the light doesn't just tell ice cube scientists that there was a neutrino there it's Direction intensity and other properties can show scientists a lot about the neutrino that caused it and where that neutrino came from lots of things in the universe make neutrinos but far fewer make neutrinos with as much energy as ice cubes detectors are tuned to notice and those detectors see a couple hundred neutrinos a day and scientists have used data about those neutrinos to study some pretty extreme environments outside of our planet like spinning neutron stars and the violent centers of galaxies but that's not all many scientists think dark matter which has mass but doesn't give off light might be made of tiny particles that act somewhat like neutrinos ice cube is an ideal observatory to search for evidence of those hypothesized particles so far though they haven't seen anything but they're still looking after all they've got the ice for it there are of course also more traditional telescopes in Antarctica including a few that study microwaves the type of thing that you might use in your kitchen to heat up a burrito microwaves have longer wavelengths than a visible light and they're used for heating up food because water absorbs microwaves really well turning them into heat in fact water is so good at absorbing microwaves that most of the microwave radiation earth receives from space never gets to the ground it's absorbed by water in the atmosphere but that's why scientists looked at Antarctica when they were planning out the background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization experiment or by SAP for short Antarctica is the largest desert on earth the air there is too too cold to hold much water so microwaves pass right through it but bicep doesn't just study any microwaves along with the nearby Keck array it studies the cosmic microwave background or CMB the oldest light in the universe the CMB is a sort of fingerprint of the Big Bang that lets scientists examine the universe when it was only a couple hundred thousand years old by revealing how matter was distributed all the way back then astronomers can test the Big Bang model by testing its predictions of how the universe evolved and where matter should be against the blobby arrangements of matter that we see in the CMB it's one of the best tools for understanding the universe and Antarctica is one of the few places on earth with a clear view and biceps already made some great contributions to our understanding of the cosmos the CMB shows us evidence of where matter was in the early universe and those measurements almost exactly match up with what we would expect from our models which helps us confirm that our understanding of all of this is on the right track best of all it also helped astronomers shed light on some things they don't really understand yet which means more science to do the name of the South Pole telescope is pretty spot-on it's at the South Pole it's also a telescope spt studies microwaves just like bicep and while it's also been used to study the CMB a lot of its time has been spent looking at what happened to the CMB z' light as those microwaves move through space because antarctica isn't just dry it's also high SP t has less light distorting atmosphere above it than many other places on earth because it's sitting on top of almost three kilometres of ice on top of that Antarctica is also dark at least in the winter the Sun doesn't rise for months so the sky stays dark and instruments stay at a pretty constant temperature so SPT and other telescopes can just keep looking out into the universe all winter with almost no interruption recently it's been used to study galaxy clusters some of the biggest structures in the universe gas and dust around these stirs distort the light of the Cosmic Microwave Background so SPT can understand the amount of mass in the clusters by looking at how much the light is distorted and by understanding clusters astronomers can understand the kinds of influences that formed them and that includes stuff that we don't fully understand like dark matter and dark energy dark matter pulls things in the universe together without emitting its own light and dark energy pushes things apart these competing forces both influence the formation of galaxy clusters so SP T's measurements can help astronomers inch their way toward understanding the behavior of the universe's most mysterious features and speaking of mysterious pieces of the universe SP T also participated in a global network known as the event horizon telescope this project famously combined images from lots of telescopes around the world to take the first picture ever of the hot gas surrounding a supermassive black hole the bigger the distance between the telescopes the better the event horizon picture would be and it's harder to get farther from most places on earth than the South Pole meaning Antarctica's remoteness was actually an advantage and dark teeka is constantly surrounded by some of the strongest circular ocean currents and winds on earth they make it hard to get to Antarctica in the first place and they make it hard to leave whether by ship or by plane and that might sound like a bad thing but nASA has found a way to use Antarctica's powers for good they've launched a series of football-field-sized balloons that get carried around the continent by those strong predictable winds giving us observatories that just float around kilometers off the ground with so much less air between them and outer space these flying instruments can see things that are much harder to find from the ground things like cosmic rays charged particles like protons that fly through space at nearly the speed of light cosmic rays come from all over the place in the universe but different kinds of objects make different kinds of rays so by studying the Rays astronomers can learn about the objects themselves Sobotka's mission was able to use cosmic rays to study how abundant elements like boron and carbon are throughout the universe scream and Anita to other high-altitude balloons have used cosmic rays from dying stars to understand supernovas the explosions made by dying stars other Antarctic balloons have studied Earth's magnetic field and still others have studied the magnetic fields of stars all these balloons don't just take advantage of Antarctica's plentiful winds daytime lasts for months during the summer so you don't have to worry about solar-powered instruments going dead at night and you don't have to worry about balloons cooling down as the temperature drops at night because there is no night all thanks to Antarctica's unbeatable location as an island at the South Pole now let's come full circle to another group of Antarctic astronomers who look down instead of up those working with the Antarctic search for meteorites which is about as well named as the South Pole telescope in the 70s scientists started realizing that Antarctica is so completely covered in ice that there are huge stretches where there are hardly any natural rocks and if you do find a rock there's a better than usual chance that it is not from Earth over the decades the Antarctic search for meteorites or ann's met and other teams have found about 50 thousand meteorites down there and it's not just stuff that fell recently the ice sheet acts like a conveyor belt as it flows carrying old meteorites along for the ride until it crunches up against something like a mountain range near the mountain range the ice bunches up squeezing trapped ancient rocks toward the surface most of the meteorite scientists find there are from when the most common types of asteroids crashed into other asteroids with debris from the collision eventually finding its way to earth these ordinary chondrites as they're known revealed the conditions of the early solar system when the asteroids first formed but not all meteorites are ordinary chondrite sand some of the others come with very specific stories based on what it's made out of scientists can tell which specific object in the solar system a meteorite came from lots of meteorites come from Vesta one of the solar system's largest asteroids but lots come from other places like Mars and in the 90s a team studying a Martian meteorite known as alh84001 made an announcement that is still controversial more than twenty years later they thought they saw signs of microscopic fossils traces they claim could only have been left behind by ancient Martian bacteria most scientists don't agree with those claims but everyone does agree that without Antarctica's isolated ice sheets this and thousands of other meteorites would never have been found and without them we would have a much worse understanding of our place in our solar system and in our universe so Antarctica might be cold remote dry and icy and dark for half the year but that's not enough to stop our intrepid astronomers and what are they're looking up into space or down into the ice they're teaching us more about our place in the universe than they ever could if we wrote off Antarctica as only being good for penguins purchase of a website or domain
