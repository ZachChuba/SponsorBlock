that the hell is going on six seconds five seconds well it's a one-on-one now c's just rotated on to the side foster's only got the three bullets but he's given time to reload and now it's all on seize he's gonna use that instead area to force him out into the open and flush out with the clutch how does that happen quad kill we are just on the edge of a loss here from the north in the first map he's trying to peek himself through but he's waiting for majes to at least flash him through that angle it does go out maybe pushing on the second one here as it does go through there's the second flash ad pushing nice pre-peek there does take down zero for the trade from death box it's all into magic he has to hurry the hell up as well because he does have a kit but not a lot of time to play with it he gets beat from two angles flicks back round angel gets his face removed but he's then fox on the side pistol in hand and he does it gets the clutch and north they're gonna pull it back for a two on three they make the round work and they keep the dream alive but for how much longer howard has have the money to play with and this still is a difficult row for north oh not not fully aware of headshot that i say we seem to get up there pretty quick and this off of black poison isn't gonna be able to have a ton of impact wait a couple more seconds although whoa okay there we go there's one kill it's all by jw of course yes oh my goodness what how did he know that that that actually connected i mean i i don't i get maybe a b split coming in here you can see our two players with the tunnels area i think they're just trying to show their hand towards a maybe drop ac down there it comes and get towards b if you can find a kill here they're back into it they go again directly past him is what we saw in the first half a lot of the time when jacob was playing here and easy spots it up how does he find that shot it's all off to best him in the end but that was an incredible display from easy just the patience to win this from simple and he spots the man on stairs and of course it's going to be an easy shot and guardian hit the first shot through the smoke on off as well that's ridiculous but nice come back here flusher getting a kill on flamey three on three obviously all the health and rifles favoring navi here to make it eight one now it's just flusher left and he's at least gonna get a kill on edward i mean it's a major player flusher is definitely uh up there as a clutch player as a clutch player too yes now would be one hell of a time to bring that quality to life he has no nades though and guardians got the angle here unbelievable hits the head shot regardless and now it's into the 1v1 ceases holding close to the connector will flush will be able to figure this out seems to have an idea of it that he could be learning oh my god the whole big headshot from plus lifted let's go right there quad kill oh what's up to hold him in position it's not a smoke though so kenny needs to be careful the hand was shown and he's gonna get the shot kyrie as he waits it out and now they've got the advantage turns back kyrie finds happy in the vents good awareness as well and suddenly mbk is left in a one verse three bomb has been dropped does manage to get cannarito that'll open up position he turns back torp he's got to answer that which kyrie has already done it's three kills for kyrie on 18 hp but only 34 for mbk a rifle might be the advantage if kyrie can get to one problem is kyrie has got vision of the bomb he knows nbk has to cross to actually do anything with this after those three frags he feel like he is in a little bit of a disadvantage right now the good news is though distinct lack of utility from mbk he needs to work out what he can do with it still has time to play with so he knows that orb is just poised and ready for him muscle positional awareness here though as he does push back the orb and we'll be able to get a plan now as well that was well done even to pre-fire and he did go for the peak but it pushes kyrie you can't be aggressive with that 18 hp bombs gonna get planted and kyrie's to try and take advantage of the time while he's doing so gets a position when nbk reads it like a book what is that craziness oh there it is now looks like clg is about to execute towards a here they're hopping around coulter all right okay cutler that's a fortunate bullet that goes a little bit sideways nothing's still on the site though there's skadoodle's response nothing's traded off but it seems like the damage has been done a little bit another kill almost through the smoke some rosa entering the site shroud is massively exposed sabrosas has a sick game sense right there almost hitting that shot like five times in the smoke yeah he's done some damage it's pretty it's pretty equal all things considered uh kit on skedoodle so there's a chance here for cloud9 still automatic he's been good for this team so far they because they have the kit they can let that smoke expire but subrosa with a very nice peak comes out on top of it and then right through the box why not sub rosa with three kills and that's the first gun round so 4-0 for clg it looked a little bit scrappy at times but subrosa just you know tapping away does it has a very good round here i like that move by clg how bomb has been planted he's up on the window rumors jdm looks for a pick he may find it he does what a flick to crims is now liquid they just burst off the back of that contact play as they now have the a side fanatic are up on a three on five retake and they're gonna have to do the almost impossible to stop this but the bomb it's down flusher finds you through the smoke and liquid they've lost a man a key man but no way he does it again flusher he's making this round happen liquid are going for so many open plants and it's gonna come back to haunt them luckily elijah's eventually dropped flusher but fnatic has still two players up in the ct spawn unfortunately i mean forest had that great position just too many players falling before he can really capitalize on it 11-2 for astralis you have to imagine this is going to have to be such an incredible defense from nip and device just tracking electro sees them around the edge of the smoke and follows it perfectly yeah clean rounds like this certainly boost the confidence in terms of the money for fnatic they're absolutely fine um the thing is now right if i'm the game leader for fnatic uh let's say it's a hypothetical situation um i'm thinking they've got the double up set up right now we haven't dropped any sort of execution like a wall of smokes towards b let's take a timer right now let's drop one of those strategies and that's why i'm not a huge fan of double ops on cobblestone ct side it can be powerful situationally if they're running defaults like this sure as soon as they know you've got the double upsell though i think you're in a lot of trouble because then i'm just waiting for the initial grenades to start dropping my wall of smokes and then trying to see what i can do after that 3b2 stewie taken out by sonny that flank is so strong and now skadoodle has to clutch this hold on skadoodle one tap throbs deletes him off the server goes for the second one are you kidding me skadoodle what is this he can actually win this 1v3 with three bullets essentially i'm getting goosebumps just watching this sky has a play he gets the bomb down he's on fire right now and he wants to win this round sonny has to feel the pressure right now he does have the kit so timing could be the most important thing here skadoodle hiding behind the bomb side he has to hit the straight headshot if he wants to he's going for it this is reliable he makes the play he gets that 3k coming in and cloud9 could this be what ignites another comeback oh my goodness car and phase i mean that was just a hail mary b play that didn't really go their way they can fall back into these slower t side rounds or just fall back into that i mean one tap through smoke that works you know if you can get it unreal for when that smoke does begin to fade so far and we'll have to make his move the rest of his team making his way out of ivy as well and the ops on the site is slowly gonna be overwhelmed crimson does find one but nice spray control from ferlin turns it down to just flush her who can get a fade away shot tries to shoot under the train and actually gets the shot to groovy and the final kill as well that was ridiculous from flusha and how does that work how does that work ever on land ladies and gentlemen give him a baseball but ligia now is going to try to play that retake sabrosa is towards that van it's a two versus two things are looking good for clg in terms of hp but not in terms of manpower now with the two versus one subrosa and the two new players step it up big here for clg that's big rather strong but he goes still alive and hiking does which is clutch but from behind lurking in the shadows fanatic they're just waiting for some extra kills i don't think they're just you know they're not trying to execute at any particular time if they can pick up one or two people coming out of the bomb site then it's still a pretty decent round for them considering how far ahead they are but if they if they let everyone live that's a big problem there's flusha oh god no there's enough time did he get it just in last second oh my god oh my god what a brilliant move ldlc will never be able to live this down for the rest of their careers they will remember this one moment where flusha utterly outplayed them headshot under rubino and zipnicks and kirby have got to set up a crossfire here there's nitro making his entrance known and kirby in a one-on-three the only one remaining there's a kit on jdm as well it's a big kill he's gonna swing out for the defuser but no they can't oh my word kirby liquid dropped the ball and somehow he wins a miracle [Music] [Music] you
