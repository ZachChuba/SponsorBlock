Hello~ Solarsido! (This side too) -ddo! This is Solar. Lately.. People have been enjoying drives in their cars. Since the weather is nice. So, I prepared a driving karaoke challenge. I'm just going to sing while going on a drive, it's a challenge like that. While driving, you have to listen to music. Yong-ke (juke) box, we're going to let's get it. [For the first song]
Altogether. ♪ Spit it out with hot lips ♪ (Calm) ♪ Spit it out with my red lips ♪
(Calm) (Cut off) Up to here. Is there a song you want to hear? While driving, I think exciting songs are good. Ah, exciting songs.
[OK, received] I like the hook.I like the hook, for any song. ♪ My heart is like dumhdurum ♪ ♪ My heart fluttered a little ♪ (New song master) (Excited) Beauties blahlah distressed.. (Give up) (Listening to hip-hop suddenly...) For you... MC... [Suddenly wanting to make up a rap name] MC... (Let's see) KD? KomDol (Teddy [bear]) -Ah, KomDol.
-KomDol. Everyone... Our Yongwangnims. After my schedule ended right now I'm on my way home for a moment.
[Talking about her current whereabouts through a stream of consciousness] I have sudden fatigue coming over me right now.
[Fatigue] [Ah-ham] I'll sing a Disney song for you. ♪ Look at this stuff, isn't it neat ♪ ♪ Wouldn't you think my collection's complete ♪
(Even the dust is suddenly floating around like in a fairy tale) ♪ Wouldn't you think I'm the girl ♪ Do you know this song? -'Love On Top'?
-Yeah, 'Love On Top'. When I was a trainee... This is a song that I sang with Wheein and Hyejin together as trainees, and failed at it. The key keeps going up. (To that place, take off)
I'm going to go to that part. (Key that ascends to the climax) From this point, we... Slowly started failing
[KomDol cackling] ♪ Baby it's (youu~) ♪ ♪ You're the one I (love) ♪ ♪ You're the one (I need~) ♪ ♪ I need~ ♪ ♪ Come on, baby, it's (youuu~) ♪ ♪ De~spacito ♪ ♪ Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito ♪
[KomDol's restrained groove] ♪ Deja que te diga cosas al oído~ ♪ 'Titanic' was on TV not too long ago. -Did you watch it?
-Ah, really? It's my life movie. Jack... I won't forgive you! I did this song with Hyejin. (Copy+paste reaction)
Ah, really? Ah, did you not know?
[What do you mean 'Ah, really'...] We did it during our fanmeeting. Ah-hah.
[Embarrassed ah-really-bot] Let's go. [Excitement loading] Together with Yong DJ We're going to let's get it~ I played like this a lot in the past. Playing DJ. Shake your head! Your head, shake your head! (Shake shake)
[KomDol excited] Let's do drive talk. Solar's drive talk. SDT. Jaewon-nim... You once... Betrayed us and left, and then came back. *Not an interrogation, but a talk*
You didn't quit because you [worked with] MAMAMOO did you? I was really happy [working] with MAMAMOO. (Happy) Really?
[Answer that she really likes] -Okay, we're going to end the talk there.
-Haha (Why?) This is my mom's favorite song.
[Introducing mom's favorite song] One was 'Worth It'. ♪ Baby I'm worth it ♪ The second song, shall we let's get it? [Preference that is out of the ordinary]
Come on. (Right up MC KomDol's alley) ♪ I'm sorry! ♪ [Resonating in the darkness]
♪ Mommom mommae mommom mommae  ♪ Jaewon, what did you say?
[Say what?] (Mommom mommae) It's amazing, right? She likes exciting songs. [MC Dduk appears] Should I rap a bit? Are you ready, MC KD? Come on. We're going to the broadcast station.
