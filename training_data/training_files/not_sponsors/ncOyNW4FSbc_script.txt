hey what's going on guys my name is Tom spark and welcome back to another video today I'm gonna be answering ten of the most common questions about torque or VPN all right guys let's get into the video hey guys if you haven't checked as well anyways guys back to the video so guys number one question about torque or VPN perhaps may be related to this channel why do I make so many videos about our tour guard you know do our work for the company so guys I'm gonna first answer the sweat second question there do I work for tour gar VPN well I don't officially work for the company I'm an affiliate for tour gar VPN which means if you click on my links I make a small cut back it's only around 30% which is much lower than most other VPN providers usually give people take for example someone were to buy an or VPN product hidemyass cyberghost ipvanish search arc expressvpn on most of the popular VPN providers they provide 100% Commission's for the one month plan if someone would be an affiliate for it talk about only pays 30% and some other top rate VPNs like Wii VPN do the same as well as air VPN only paid 20% so I am an affiliate for all these companies and if someone was to say that I work for tour guard because I'm an affiliate for them well I guess if that's true then I work for around 60 VPN companies at the same time so guys but why specifically do I make so many videos about tour guard then well that's because they're my top rated VPN on the channel my favorite product here on the channel for many reasons one of the reasons being they're so cheap and affordable another reason being they have a lot of security features that I like and another reason being that I really trust a company you think it's pretty transparent as well as being constantly impressed on a daily basis by their customer support used use tour guard you know what I'm talking about you should get a response from four to five minutes from their support team whether it's handing out of streaming IP or something like that or just answering a basic question anyways guys now let's talk about question number two why is tour guards so cheap I see his question a fair amount on the channel of people asking me how is it so cheap why is it so cheap what sort guard is actually a pretty good deal for which you get the standard plan is around ten dollars a month and the yearly plan is around $60 however my promo code Tom sparc you could cut that in half by 50% one reason that tour guard does this is because it's just an incentive for people to buy the product if they could find a good sale on it they're likely to feel like it's a good deal and it really is these are permanent codes if you sign up for one month it'll auto renew and apply the code the next month as well so it's not like you're just using a code for one month and not having it auto renew again so I think they're very consumer friendly in that sense not only that I actually think tour guards true value is more around ten dollars a month and sixty dollars a year I think getting 50 percent off is an extra bonus that's just a little perk of the company they seem to be pretty generous with these promo codes providing me one for you guys and providing other affiliates as well that decide to use them [Music] torger keys easily just keep the price at $10 a month or $60 a year and still be much cheaper than other competitors like expressvpn which is $13 a month or $100 a year or they could just be a little bit less expensive than some other competitors like Nord VPN however at $5 a month and $30 a year for their core package they pretty much undercut everyone out there and I think that's probably one of the reasons why they're so cheap and why they're so generous with his discount codes is they know that this model works not only that but tour card is cheap because they have more margins in the product remember how I said noir VPN gives a hundred percent of the commission away for people who are on affiliates for them so let's say PewDiePie decided to become an order VPN affiliate which he is if he were to recommend you to buy an or VPN you clicked on his link he would make $13 that means that noir VPN gets zero money out of that and it kind of makes you wonder how these companies stay in business perhaps that's one reason why private internet access another VPN provider who spends a lot of money advertising for Linus tech tips has around a 50% of affiliate Commission rate but even they went out of business and had millions of dollars in debt Torbert however is able to maintain the slow price point because they have a local affiliate commission model around only 30 percent so even if I am recommending someone to buy it and to our guard makes a sale there they're still making more money than Nord VPN even though there's significantly cheaper because they're not giving a hundred percent of it to me so in fact I think that actually tour guard is a good price and it's a consumer friendly model that lets them make profit makes me make a little bit of money and it lets you pay not that much for a good product I think it's actually pretty genius the third question is what is the difference between tour guards streaming package and regular VPN package well this is actually kind of confusing and I've seen people get troubled by this and not really know the answer to it so I'm going to explain it in simplest terms possible in 2016 Netflix decided they wanted to block VPN providers and people who are using VPNs from accessing Netflix until this year you weren't able to access Netflix with a VPN unless it had special geo blocking abilities however now you can use Netflix for pretty much any VPN provider but you can only view content that is associated with your home country Netflix is able to kind of detect when you're using a VPN that doesn't unblock G restrictions but it's not able to detect specific VPN tricks and techniques that will lay you on blocks specific regions but nowadays you can even give VPNs that can unblock more regions of that flex so let's say you're in the United States of America and you want to watch the Japanese version on Netflix or perhaps a UK service that is G restricted like BBC iPlayer you can actually do that with some VPNs however some VPNs will only work with the home region of Netflix serving you only mostly what is Netflix originals you're not able to watch specific content to specific regions so comparing torger VPN streaming and towards regular package the regular package is more just a core VPN service that's not meant for streaming as much if you download towards regular package which is we have $5 a month or $30 a year you're gonna be able to watch Netflix original sync however if you buy the streaming package which is around $12 a month and 60 dollars a year with code Netflix you're gonna be able to watch a couple different areas let's say in the United States of America you're gonna be able to watch a Japanese version on Netflix on something like BBC iPlayer now you only get two selected locations which is a little bit of a downside but the unique upside is that these are unique IPS used only by you so they will never be blocked alright guys let's move onto the next question the fifth most common question I see about tour guard VPN is what are the best settings to use well for most people I would actually suggest just putting your login credentials connecting to a server nearby and keeping the settings as is this is pretty good for most every single person out there and one of you reviews say that tour guard is too hard to use or to customizable or something like that it's just being disingenuous because you can actually use the default settings - pretty much really good results now ever if you do want to customize and you want to tinker around with settings and you're the type of person who wants to do that chances are you kind of know what these settings do however I've even made a guide on the channel called the tour guard master guide where you can look at some of these settings and what they do in full end up an explanation of what you should configure go ahead and check that one out if you're interested in more detail on how to configure tour guard to its best potential you can do some pretty cool things like setup scripts in order to automatically open a browser when you launch tour guard automatically close browser automatically open up certain applications stuff like that you can even find more information about that on the tour guard forums the next question I want to talk about is how to use tor go its proxy or perhaps what is the difference between tor guards proxy and sore guard VPN well tor guard proxy is what is called a Sox via proxy so it's basically a server kind of subscriptions similar VPN but it's not actually a client itself instead you're just gonna gain access to their server so you're gonna type in kind of URL into BitTorrent or something like chrome using their extension and you're gonna be able to anonymize your IP now this isn't gonna encrypt your outgoing traffic but it's gonna give you some level of anonymity especially while torrenting because copyright swarms or anyone trying to find out if you're downloading stuff they'll only be able to see this anonymous IP not your real IP which is how you usually get in trouble with copyright companies the next question I see commonly is how do you store guard on our router now just like my tour guard master guide I've also made several videos on this on the channels where well I talked about in-depth explanations of how to use tor guard on specific routers mini routers that they sell is among other things to unblock streaming services and unblock gee restrictions on game consoles and stuff like that usually the kind of basic idea is that you're gonna get a tour card subscription make an Open VPN config file with the Open VPN confectionery easy you pretty much upload that file into your routers VPN section and then you're pretty much good to go it's quite simple and pretty cool in order to put VPN across house-wide Wi-Fi without the need for applications another question I see often is what is the best way to use tor guard on a TV now you can either use the VPN router solution or you can use what is called a Amazon fire stick these things around will range from around 30 to 50 bucks and you can find them on Amazon pretty much what you can do is lotor guard on that directly as an application and you can even unblock streaming restrictions with like I mentioned before the streaming IPS which work on Amazon fire stick as well I think this is the easiest way to get Toro it up and running on a TV if you specially if you want to unblock your restrictions or are you stuff like Cody or those kind of things you could even install it on Android TV boxes as well liked in the videos shield lastly another question that I haven't really seen you often but I think could be useful for people is how to turn on ad block now tor board actually allows you to add a a blocking DNS within their application settings not a lot of people know about this but it can be very useful if you want to block ads while using tor guard VPN and a dns level anyways guys these are just some of the common questions I've seen here about tor guard on the channel this sends a lot of the people on my channel like and used to Oregon a regular basis I do think that these videos are a help you've already seen the outlines some of the most common questions and give them pretty detailed answers so I hope you liked this video and let me know down the comments down below what you liked about tour guard and why it's your favorite VPN anyways guys see you on the next video very
