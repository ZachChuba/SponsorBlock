you think you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below Sukie check it out we'll start it off 196 this video is brought to you by the below and keep a lookout on Black Friday it'll be $30 off first up we have johann with a really clean looking set up a nice long white desk some pops of RGB in the very colorful wallpaper a light strip behind the desk and color matching peripherals but checking it out going with the single monitor here a nice ultra wide it's an asus 32 inch at $134,900 gb lights you know shine nice and bright with a matching white glorious model Oh Mouse they're both on the SteelSeries quick edge extended mousepad and ask for audio you could see in the background Logitech G 560 light sink speakers with the Fidelio x2 h our headphones now as for the PC we have that sexy looking case that is thief antics and do evolve X in silver insides an Intel i5 8600 K CPU with the courser h 110 a GTA i/o 16 gates of GCL tried NZ r gb ram on an asus z 370 gave me a 5 motherboard an EVGA GTX 1080 FTW 2 for the graphics cards and though RGB fans are actually fan frames from fantex B fantex halo digital RGB frames very nice very nice and all together it is definitely a nice looking setup and I think the wallpaper choice is a 10 out of 10 it really brings the colors together a nice accent with a silver and stuff it adds that nice splash of color pop know what I'm saying good stuff Johan next up we have Chris with the triple monitor orientation although it's two monitors and the mounted TV as the overhead but it's still triple displays in the white and black kind of layout here for the color theme and lots of Dragon Ball Z in the wallpaper is the prints even the mousepad so checking it out those two bottom monitors are 27-inch g-sync displays from Dell with a 49 inch Samsung TV has that stacked overhead house for the peripherals we be course our gaming k70 RGB keyboard with logitech g502 proteus spectrum mouse and then a Dragonball Z custom mousepad which I assume is you know custom printed and then four speakers in the back Logitech G 6:23 with the audio technica ath and 50x headphones in white over to the PC now the NZXT eh 700 i case we have an Intel i7 3770k CPU inside with the coarser h1 15i a IO 32 gigs of course er vengeance RGB RAM on a Mesa saber-tooth z77 tough motherboard in the EVGA GTX 1080 TI graphics card very nice and clean build though a color theme here as on point matching everywhere then as you can see across the room some more collectibles with some things like Gundam figures the Dragon Ball Z stuff comic books hung up and overall a definitely cool gaming room so good stuff Chris and I gotta commend you for spanning the wallpaper so it all kind of lines up even though he kinda looks like the Canadians in South Park oh baby now we've got Michael and this is super clean all around the practically floating design to the monitor so great job of mounting that great job of cable management as well loving some RGB setups like this and another set up featuring a Dragonball Z print thumbs up for your fan so all three of those monitors are the sigh ma g27 CQ so they line up perfectly at 27 inches of peace and I can't tell if the cables are being routed actually into the wall or just off the right side of that monitor behind the PC but either way it is beautiful down to the peripherals for the keyboard it's the razor Huntsman elite with the Razer Mamba chroma Mouse on the eraser chroma extended mouse pad you can see there the whole drove to the middle of desk to wrap the cables down there and for audio the Razer naari ultimate headset with the Razer chroma base station so literally for all the peripherals we're going Razer changing things up going with Corsair for the case now this is the course their suspect Omega RGB case inside the Rison 720 700 X CPU with the NZXT kraken X 52 a IO 32 gigs of juice cult right and z are GB RAM with an asus rog Strix GT X 1080 graphics card so Michael hitting us with the beautiful Razer chroma RGB to the T set up here really really liking what you've done it's like I said like for a third time now a beautiful job with cable management and mounting those monitors you can't get any cleaner than that next up we've got Sean dem 29 or Sean Dom 29 I don't know but the triple monitor setup and not in the traditional orientation we have to as the stack two monitors set up with a larger monitor as the primary some serious audio game you saw the drums and stuff but let's dive into the gear which is what you guys care about so his primary is asus rog PG 34:8 q so they're very popular 34 inch gaming model with two dell 24 inch monitors side by side method as the overhead option for his main peripherals the keyboard is a cursor gaming k70 RGB siz actually they're older vengeance lineup so shout outs path from one of them and the mouse is a razor or a bose wireless and then for audio those puppies are the ke f LS 50 speakers and that nice bright red got the amp and DAC and the mixer on the desk free Amazon echo show 5 and 4 headphones and headset we have the SteelSeries arc 2 7 and the ath m50x headphones then over to the PC a beautiful custom water here really nice job love the the neon issue blue like the fluorescent pop it has this is the Lian Li PC 0:11 ROG case from Asus inside Intel i7 7700 K CPU on the ASUS Maximus 13 motherboard 64 gigs of course our Dominator platinum Ram and a GTX 1080 TI graphics card but like I said just a real good job on that custom hard line loop so Shawn Dom Shawn Dom I'm digging it all around I like seeing an unconventional you know monitor setup like this and with those drums and all that audio gear I assume you're into music production or mixing and stuff like that so good job utilizing the space for your hobbies guys my name is Julian bright and here's my college room setup since this is my bedroom it's a place I like to relax do homework and work on video and photo projects as you can tell I have the popular white walnut theme circulating through the entire room I like to keep the theme going in every area of the room including this vintage camera shelf I made in the corner at night I normally like to watch YouTube or Netflix so I got a TV off Craigslist on top of a media stand that's either connected to my Apple TV or Xbox for my desk I have the ever-so-popular IKEA countertop on top of the Alex drawers above my desk is a clock with no battery for pure aesthetics and some art that my roommates love to make fun of on one side of my desk I have a plant to add some color and a fridge on the other side under my desk is a custom PC I made a couple years ago with the GTX 1080 and i7 processor inside this gives me enough power to edit videos which is the main purpose I use the setup for I have an audio technica mic on it rode boom arm that I'm talking on right now and on my desk I like to keep it pretty simple for peripherals I have a Corsair k70 keyboard and a Logitech MX master mouse all the wires go through the desk and then along the wire rack I screw it into the bottom of the desk for my speaker's I use this Edifier bookshelf speaker along with my headphones that I like to put on this glass head huge shout-out to Frank for having me on and if you want to see more of my desk feel free to check out my youtube channel alright
