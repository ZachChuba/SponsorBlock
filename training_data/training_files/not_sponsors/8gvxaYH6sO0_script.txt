patiently waiting for BTS members and PD PI I feel like this list is like my make-a-wish for some reason they're always so generous to me I mean to PewDiePie so how does it work is this voted is that why it I I don't understand I'm like Tana when she win the award I don't deserve this guys look I'm not that dead right there why are you riding LML huh what's with these laughing emojis huh what's so

should have been number one god damn it suck it kpop stands number two baby - we went from 18 was it - you know what I just want to say thanks to everyone who voted for me I really appreciate it thank you next dose so basically the way I find out about all this was that I was literally googling myself I don't normally google myself okay because I would needed a picture of myself for thumbnail I don't I'm not dilute sir I swear I don't think I would go myself what is this now media portray pewdiepie is a loser to sell his success story says huge damage it never ends there's so many articles coming out lately I'm just like I can't keep up with this I mean that goes for anyone I thought it was so obvious when I said that it's like when you sorry this is a complete sidetrack by the way just happen to see this it's cuz I did the Q&A video and a lot of people had a lot of responses to that or just echoing what I said he said this in short pewdiepie things media portrayed tried to pretend my as a loser so that his success story could be sold okay I mean obviously I was kind of a loser but not just like epic loser I was in-between loser okay there is a thing there is such a thing don't even try to pretend it isn't so another thing I mentioned in my past video was that media always under evaluates me after all the controversies before it was like beauty pie make 200 billion and now it's like oh pretty pie made less than I don't know some other youtuber I'm like I'm pretty sure like I don't know their personal business or whatever but I'm pretty sure okay 14 billion views okay 14 billion views I mean four billion sorry but then the Sun was like okay all right well then we over valuate the you then 54 million in 2019 apparently I made 54 million guys it's just so crazy it's every good so it was like I get that people want to know the exact number so people are just gonna make up a bunch of stuff but this thing doesn't make any sense it says January I made five point eight million and then it says it in December I made two point nine it should be the opposite because December is usually at least almost like three or four times more than January but here they evaluate January almost twice as much as December like that makes no sense and what's the brofist logo what does that mean I'm so confused so this study was based this was based on a study this research was carried out by online Marketplace on Viacom what is that they just link to the website I try to find the study I cannot find it um Papa s'more eeeh and I do research I am so confused nothing even shows up when I search PewDiePie but my favorite part of this article is the little fun fact window PewDiePie scandal you know in case you forgot you remember this huh you remember this you remember this and then I want forgot about this just in case you forgot we just in case you forgot we have to mention this also we made it a bullet point list just so it's easier for you to in case you forgot in caves anyone's forgotten it seems to me that a lot of times when people bring up bad things I've done then fans wants to respond to me like well actually you know he's done a lot of positive things like look he's done charity and then the response is like just because you did charity doesn't mean it absorbs order yours bad behavior but it's like well the point is just to contrast it if you're constantly bringing up all the negative over and over and over then yeah you're gonna paint a bad picture that's the whole point people aren't saying if the charity he's amazing that's not the point everybody why you're only allowed to make one side of the argument you would never see a PewDiePie's charity deeds or whatever like a list randomly in an article that's just not happening that's my point I'm not saying what I did was okay it's just like it's always there always okay so apparently I made almost three times more than dude perfect so there you go thank you the Sun for not at least under evaluating me I appreciate that I think that's fair there we go are they they they kept going how would they keep going oh wow all right you know what I take it back I take back my thank you I also like the headline from the Sun before quitting YouTube I'm not quitting YouTube it's how hard is it to understand I'm not quitting Jesus next news this is pewdiepie related Pianist why are there so many articles I don't understand it shows up on the front page here Swedish youtuber pewdiepie describes fans in Malaysia and Singapore as hectic and screamish did you guys know about this I said there's a week ago and it's posting now I'm so confused reset you thinking today about the news a week ago that isn't really news I want to bring this up mainly just to clarify what I said in the video was that I was comparing fan culture from different going in the more Asian region compared to smaller Scandinavian countries you know it's very very different so that made me think that that's a train behavior the reason I was so annoyed in Malaysia was because people were literally entering our hotel and it felt like we couldn't leave our hotel because people were just looking for us and it felt like we were being hunted almost but I will say you know I was being a bit dishonest when I spoke about Singapore because actually the first time I got recognized in Singapore that was like a huge thing for me because I've never been recognized as a celebrity before quotation mark I don't know if you have footage of that but it was absolute madness it's something that I've learned that I I personally don't enjoy but I would be lying if I said you know I hated it the first time it happened especially back then as well because YouTube wasn't really a thing back then it wasn't recognized even by the media or anyone so to see the effect that had on fans was kind of it was kind of cool to see you know I just wanted to point that out I'm sorry if I was a little harsh to you at Singapore and Malaysia it's not your fault okay like that was fun I'm not gonna lie just so we clear all right Sorry Sorry I'm sorry next juice alright this is one of my favorite things I've heard it in a while because it's just so funny so there's this new meme called new guy that trends this as well when I go to myself new guy meme trends following controversial PewDiePie comic I'm just like how does that relate to me I am so confused so basically what happened was only ng pointed out that he saw someone else who made this webcomic and it goes like this I won't show the artist because it's it's besides the point but basically it's saying hey hey oh what's so funny new guy hey that millionaire gamer bro - SH bag totally got robbed hey hey hey how do you like it if you were robbed new guy says oh wow I can tell we're gonna be the kind of co-workers who become good friends wow really hell nah he'll now the thing is like so this is the person that made the webcomic and this person is trying to vilify a new guy but that person is so tone deaf they didn't understand that they make themselves look like an idiot it's so weird what's the word for it it's so unselfish this is the first thing I saw today and people started parroting it saying baka it's not like I wanted to be your friend or anything new guy Oh new guy later that night Oh new guy if only you knew we could be so much more than friends so good great everyone Helga from hey Arnall if you guys saw that comic new guy empathetic caring places himself in the shoes of his fellow man questions sociopathic behavior it was happy when he thought he made a friend even one lacking empathy he has all landmarks of a good protagonist if he were real he'd make a good friend I want to be friends with new guy he seems great he's not judging so the artists also made this comic where she misinterprets this blonde girl is saying that she has a girlfriend when in reality she just meant that she has a friend that's a girl and then she follows up with saying okay well sorry but that is infinitely less interesting to me okay great so let's look at that way I don't use Twitter anymore how's it work hashtag new guy I just love had this spawn this new guy thing how can you not love him he's so cute I love how they try to make him as a bad person and it's just like and I love how his base of probably a real human interaction that happened over someone celebrating me getting my house robbed people who are hurt hurt people ever since realizing that I swore I would never hurt anyone the pain ends with me I really like this message cuz I don't know anything about this person who wrote this webcomic and and I really highly don't want anyone to seek out this person or anything like that I think it's more the point here is that to react in a way that is so I don't want to boohoo me or whenever I'm looking at this outside of my own context but the fact that you know people who react in this way about something unjust happening to someone to me is you know it's not normal they I feel like it's not normal behavior to react this way I think a lot of times when people project anger on the internet or in what towards other people it sounds like they're probably dealing with something their own and they're just lashing out on other things which it's not new it's always gonna happen you know I sound like that guy we're really haters hate themselves you know but there's a clear distinction to me wishing actual harm on someone or something illegal to happen to someone as a way to celebrate it even if you don't like him it's not normal to want that to happen to someone genuinely like haha that's the weird part of me and and and how that line is blurred because I'm a millionaire apparently when it's not about the money it's about the personal space and it's weird how no one understands that and that's what new guy's saying it's like well you wouldn't like it if it happened to you so yeah man I'm explaining to this poor late but I hope you understand hey there's really hate themselves with the point of new guy is that just understanding that yen just because people who are hurt hurt other people doesn't mean you have to attack them back you know even if they have a bad take or a bad idea so now you have this comics about this person being canceled insult but new guy steps in I was created to be the part of an insensitive joke but through love and kindness you turned me into something amazing for 20/20 new guy new guy I just also like it because it's clearly gone so overboard a lot of these back and forth interactions on it on the internet that it's it's nice to see just someone be like all right from now on no more of this you know so yeah there's a ton of really funny fine arts and comics about there's new and memes about this new guy I also like this person who pointed out just how shape language usually aggressive and active is triangular and static and trustworthy are square shape so they literally just made themself into a villain and this person they try to make it as a bad person as somewhat trustworthy it's so unintentional and tone-deaf that it it created this really strange phenomena which I endorse I think it's great when you're supposed to be the dumb guy but at the end you turn into the good guy you're part of the reason I wanted to delete Twitter because I are so sick of people just jail yelling at each other it is felt so unproductive it's like what's the point of this what's the end game it's this waste of time and energy so yeah I hope that spirit carries on it brought a smile to my face and it's nice to see as an outside perspective even though I'm technically and involved in a really weird way new guy Employee of the Month so that's it for all the news this week also World War three is happening ah and guys for watching I'm published Moorea signing off hey though hey
