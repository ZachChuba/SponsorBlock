hey what's going on everybody we got new update coming in the car here it just finished its upload here so we're gonna go and check it out we got twenty twenty dot 12.6 which should have let's take a look at those release notes and that should have come on now there we go the traffic light and stop sign control which is beta I'm so excited about this because it is so helpful and anything to help our drive to keep us safe is going to be that much more better for us so let's take a look at the release notes here and it says traffic light and stop sign controls is designed to recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs slowing your car to a stop when using traffic aware cruise control or auto steer now this goes against some of the things that I see in some of my past ones that the previous even the previous one is not designed to be used except for on the interstate well continuously Tesla keeps telling us that this is designed to be used while we're using traffic to where control cruise control or the auto steer so if their cars are becoming ready to be on the road here and use them in city streets if you will I've been using in the city street for since I've got the car so I don't know and it says as your car purchase in the intersection your car will indicate the intention to slow down via a notification slow down and stop at the redline shown on the driving visualization to continue through the stop line push down the gear selector once or briefly press the accelerator that will confirm that is safe to proceed as with all autopilot features you must continue to pay attention and be ready to take immediate action understandably so because that's what we do now and lastly here in the last portion of it here it says be ready to take a media action including braking this feature may not stop for all traffic controls this feature will be conservative slow down often at first and will not attempt to turn through intersections and what it says here is over time that as we learn from the fleet the feature will control more naturally which is pretty cool that's what everything does it's supposed to anyway it's enabled issues we got to go into the park to enable it what we have to do is put the Garden Park and then tap controls autopilot traffic light and stop sign control beta they say it as beta in here and then the note on here says when this feature is enabled the maximum speed set while using auto steer is limit to the speed limit of the road so no more offsets if you know what the offset is it's you know but if you don't it's either you can set your offset if the speed limit says 45 then you can make it jump up and be at 50 or 50 to one of those numbers like that so that's what that's what that is right there and also the other thing that's you know important here is that camera calibration may be required so if you get that warning or that note says you have to do that that's what you're gonna have to do and also the latest version of navigation maps must be downloaded via Wi-Fi please refer to the owner's manual for additional details about that I think we already have that so what we're gonna do is jump into our settings we're gonna go in here and then it's under autopilot and then as you can see here we got to put it in park track plate beta it's gonna give us another warning right here I'll put that on the screen you can pause and read it and it's asked me if I want to control it while it's in beta yes I do all right we're gonna get out here and drive that's pretty much it y'all ready to go let's go to this garage now the reason why I think that they need the maps download it is they might be identifying where stop signs are on that map you know in conjunction with the cameras being able to view it so we're gonna come up to the first stop sign up here so the speed limit is set to a max of 35 as it indicated in there and as you guys can see that it is straight 35 I can't go any faster than that which that's the warning that they gave all right so I want to make sure my hand is straight on the steering wheel here and just holding on to it and we'll we'll be coming up to this stop sign here in just a few seconds kind of nervous about it I'm stopping for traffic control in 500 feet 400 300 200 100 that is so cool I'm not doing it I know there's a car in front of us but I'm not doing it my foots over the brake let's see let's see I have to use the accelerator to start going again okay it's still pretty interesting alright so I'm off of it we got another one here stopping for a trap control and 500 feet again and what we're gonna be doing is going I think straight here I don't know see you know we'll turn left so we have to brake autopilot there and auto steer and we'll get out of that it would have done it the green lights on here are there they're glowing a lot more than they normally were maybe it was just a glitch there because there's two traffic lights in there so so we're back in autopilot now we're gonna be here we have a big major I'm sorry this is not a major addition we have a small intersection coming up for all you people that live in California and all the other cities that are like extremely large it's one of our major intersections so we're coming up to that lane change was smooth everything's good we'll tap that and bring it up to the speed limit that car turning and making that right-hand turn that was a lot smoother than then it had been before I've noticed before that the car will come to like this this stop like almost like a it needs to make a full stop and then wait for the car to clear and then go that last one was really smooth a couple cones popping up all right so we've got an intersection coming up here there is traffic at it let's see if it gives us the warning 600 feet so 600 feet seems to me the magic number of when it cut when it happens well let's jump over here into this Lane get back on auto steer as quick as we can coming to a stop is it will it all right we got a green light and it's still singing to come to a stop of that at stop bar the stop bar is very accurate though which is wild all right here we go we're gonna get over in this lane hopefully I'll make it up here all right back on autopilot tap to the speed limit oh we got an offset of 2 miles an hour on this one they said it didn't do that but we have that offset on here see if you can see right here it's 52 and let's see if it's gonna stop here 600 feet 500 feet there we go my foots not on the brake temper this is so cool I'm so excited about this the red bars they're a little jerky at that last moment right there but that's still not bad at all really clean stop and it's behind the stop bar hit this car over here is in front of the stop bar just a little bit it's not as far as it is on the on there but oh maybe it is no it's not and it gave us a warning on there says he was accelerated to to proceed and that was good because it doesn't want to just jump through the intersection there but soon as you know it's supposed to be promised last year at the end of the year but I'm happy with it now as long as it's working really relatively good I'm extremely happy about that so so 600 feet seems to be the magic number that this the car can actually detect where that where that traffic light is on or off hopefully we'll get a green one here stopping for 400 feet no I don't want to stop so for whatever reason in that last one the the car was trying to stop there there is a left-hand turn signal and that might have been interfering with it thinking that one of its one of them was red I don't know but it was slowing down for that again beta we get that but I am noticing on here if you guys can if we pinch in and zoom these red lights are brighter and they have such a more of a haze to them there goes coming to a stop again but see it still shits its green light so that might be a little annoying to some of you guys if you're not you know you'll have to tap the accelerator even though there's a green light you got it you got a guy go through it because it's requesting that it that it slows down no matter what alright so we've got a green light here in the middle no cars in front of us and let's see what it says stopping for a trap control device and 500 huh so there's definitely gonna have to be some learning on this this is going to be where every traffic light it seems like is going to be requesting to slow down or stop and then you have to override it and say hey let's let's go ahead and keep on going Tesla yep that's exactly what's happening every single traffic light it is it's slowing down and then you have to have some input in there and so I wonder if there's any other controls that will you know bypass or override the the traffic signal so we got one coming up here we're gonna have that 600 feet so if I push up on the on the wheel here to increase the speed it doesn't do anything so you are definitely gonna have to come in and either touch the stalk or you're gonna have to put your foot on the accelerator there so a couple glitches with the the offset it wasn't bad I'm happy about that it's fine because if I go a couple miles an hour over it's not too too bad it's not detrimental hey it's doing kind of what we wanted to do not exactly but at least at the intersections it slows down and makes you kind of wake up so just halfway down tapping that will bring you back to normal drive right there so in this version I'm not noticing too much difference with the autopilot driving it seems like it's really good it seems like it was before averaging out a wide lane that's coming into like two lanes coming into one seemed a little bit smoother but I really can't tell a you know a significant difference so we're gonna do here is we've got this green light coming up I want to see what happens if I don't touch it will it come to a full and complete stop I think it will yeah definitely will that so we have cars coming so we're gonna move over oh it's so cool though yeah I'm super pumped up bad because there this is pretty nice to be able to have this especially if you're coming up to traffic lights in and you know you're just if you glanced over something the safety factor of it it'll wake you up with having it on so that when you do are comin up those traffic lights you're like why is the car slowing down oh there's a you know traffic light this so when you are looking around or if you're looking at something something fell it's just another added layer of safety on here and that's pretty I'm pretty pumped about it hope you guys are strangely accurate so if one of you guys know can you let me know in chat is Tesla using like identifying on a map with whether it be like you know GPS coordinates or pens oh there's a traffic light here and someone coordinated 600 feet cuz it's always 600 feet that it starts at as you can see it's right here if you have the auto steer the traffic light and stop sign aware on then it's going to come to that stop but if you have it off then the car in front of you dictates what you do so if that car runs through that red light you'll run through the red light without it you'll be essentially stopping at that stoplight whether it's green or red and you have to override in order to go through it and we do have another set of traffic lights we're gonna go through and then we're gonna test my road that I always test when we get a new you know firmware or software update I want to see how this car treats that road and if you want to see it on a map it is literally right over here it's this 90-degree turn right here and the car usually just can't handle it it just doesn't it either cuts it short and then and then why'd it understeers over steers whatever you want to describe it as but it's that road right there and we're not too far away from it so we're gonna head over there we're right there we got to go down and and we'll be over there in just a second 600 foot for the stop sign picking that one up here we go full and complete stop to it and then once you get here you can use the stock I think to continue on I did and it's handled that little opening right there perfectly and flawlessly awesome alright here we go resumed it right there I put my foot over there just in case but again we're gonna turn over here we got off autopilot a little bit jerky on that disconnect there with the autopilot oh we got fifty two we did that offset again so there is a little bit of a glitch eNOS in there that you can kind of bypass that offset I don't recommend it just in case you start blasting through you know red lights and it can't calculate six hundred feet based off of your current speed and then it changes I don't know just just try not to the offset so that is pretty sweet and awesome I'm so happy about that that is really nice I'll probably have to drive a little bit more while I have it on but I know that it will stop at these stop signs and stops like stoplights for me alright we have one last test we're gonna do is we're gonna try to go through this stop sign right here with the car just driving and I want to see if it detects anything or does anything do you have a car coming up here not the technical slowing down and nothing so you do have to be on auto steer in order for it to like either slow down or warn you of the stop sign simple as that alright so I hope you guys appreciate this video here we're pretty much finished up with that it works great there's a little bit of a you know kind of a quirkiness to get used to it because you do have to drive a little bit more you got to put your foot on the accelerator whereas if you're in a heavy traffic situation you might not want this on because you are going to be in traffic anyway and the traffic is going to dictate you unless you're at the front of the line right there but but nonetheless you can use the stock to do it just a half touchdown or all the way down like you're putting it in Drive but the rest of this video here we're gonna go check out this 90 degree go through it twice and that's it the video liking and subscribing it's been a real treat be able to show you this here I'm excited to have it I got a road trip going from here in Daytona Beach to Tampa tomorrow so might do some more time lapse on that so that Bell button we'll put some more videos up for you all right here we go 15 miles an hour that's what the warning signs over there and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna bring it down to the 20 because I've been testing in at 20 seems reasonable that did its thing again it went real wide caught inside and then went real wide so we're gonna go through one more time and that'll be that on this pass what it normally does is almost goes into the guardrail cuts inside here and there it goes it launches out to the outside of the guardrail and can't do it so no change in the autopilot algorithm there's nothing that I can tell that's different in there we did get the we did get the stop sign and stoplights though that's a little bit different but with guiding the road and guiding sharper than like a 40 degree or 45 degree turn it's really difficult for 90s on this one particularly that's the only one I ever tested on so when that one improves you guys gonna know about it I don't see you guys again soon have a good one
