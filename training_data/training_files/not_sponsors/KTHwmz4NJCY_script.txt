okay so today I would like to have a wee chat with you about the difference between shells sub shells and orbitals this is something that was never really explained to me properly in secondary school these terms are just kind of used interchangeably with each other and they were never there just never differentiated between each other so I'd like to try and explain to you the difference if you're in the same boat and you're a bit like I don't know so what is the difference between shells sub shells and orbitals so with gar electrons and they orbit the nucleus of an atom at different ranges which we call the shows it could be helpful to think of the electrons as planets orbiting the Sun so we've got the Sun in the middle that will be the nucleus and then the first planet orbiting the Sun is I should look this up mercury is mercury so mercury um four versus on and that could be known as the first shell and then in the second shell we've got three Venus we've got Venus and Mercury Venus okay so second one is Venus and that is the second shell and I'm very desired then right and so on and each planet is certain distance away from the Sun like the shells are from the nucleus and each major shell has sub shells so we've got sub shells in the shells Ursa Major shells have different numbers of sub shells and therefore a whole different number of numbers of electrons atoms contain an infinite number of possible electron configurations the configuration associated with the lowest energy level of the atom is called a ground state and the ethical principle shows how energy increases in subshells by filling the lowest energy sub shell first the ground state is built up as the energy of the atom increases the number of sub shells filled increases the shells have which in turn have atomic orbitals so we've got we've got the shells we've got the sub shells and we've got the orbitals so the quantum numbers we've got s P and F they designate the sub shells and then say we've got the P sub shell that has three orbitals px py and PZ or P's that each orbital can hold a total of two electrons making six the total number of electrons that P sub shell can hold the T sub shell has five orbitals and can hold a total number of 10 electrons the F sub shell has seven orbitals and can hold a total number of fourteen electrons it might be too helpful to think of a shell as a neighborhood and then a sub shell as a house or a block of flats and then the orbitals they would be the different rooms inside a house the general idea is that you can't tell exactly where an electron is but he will be in his room probably on the ground floor flat electrons are in the ground mistake they don't need to release much energy to get out of their house but the ones higher up they do need to release more energy as they've got all those stairs to climb I hope that has been a little bit helpful or else just it's confused you all the more um if it is the ladder feel free to pop some questions below down in the comments and I will do my best to answer them before else if I can't answer them just point you in the right direction thank you for watching an awesome 20% off their annual premium subscription
