Good morning and welcome to another day
of landscape photography in a spectacular spectacular Scotland. Last week it was difficult I had a hard time bringing the huge landscape down it
into an interesting composition so what we're doing today is we're going to head
over to Glencoe where you've got those stunning scenes with that quite
famous mountain which I'm hopefully going to capture again I've shot it in
the past but I want to do something with it today though. On the way though we've
stopped here at Ruthven barracks and there's just this stunning scene going
down to the barracks at the bottom of the hill here and that is what I'm going
to capture just look how beautiful that morning light is as its striking those
mountains and that's going to feature in the background of the shot I've put the
barracks which is raised up on a little sort of mound on the rule of thirds and
I'm gonna let that carry up into the stunning background of these mountains
here it's just gonna work really nicely as a shot. There is a visitor's center
quite close to the castle but we've come up a little way past there to get this
viewpoint and I'm sort of hiked up through very very deep snow to get to
this little spot I've therefore got the 70-200mm
 lens on the camera because I want to get in a little bit closer to
the barracks and frame my composition properly at the moment I'm at 100mm
 to get the composition that I want and then I'm at f11 just because
it's about right for this scene shutter speed I'm at 1/25 of a second and I've
just got the polarizer on the front just to lift the Blues and the contrast in
the sky because it is quite flat there's a little bit of haze in the air as well
and the polarizer will help with that just a little bit so it's gonna be a
really great shot to get the day started off so I've got it composed already I'm
just gonna fire the shutter off I'm bracketing just to be sure
let's have a look That's looking absolutely beautiful now
I've got a long drive to get to Glencoe but that is a perfect start to the
morning After a very long and difficult Drive we
have arrived at Glencoe and it's been a little bit of a blessing in disguise
actually because when we arrived at the place we planed to go where you get
that classic shot of that classic mountain which I can't pronounce..... the
carpark was rammed. Part of the problem is just the snow is so deep and
there's about two feet of snow at the moment just have a look at this and you
can see how deep it is and that's the same on the road where the ploughs pushed
it to the side of the road and there's literally nowhere to park there is a
little road you can go down as well but that's totally blocked so we've had to
turn around and find another little layby to park in which, like i say, has
been a blessing in disguise because what I found is this scene here with this
mountain here is what I'm shooting at the moment the Sun has just risen over
the peak of the bigger mountain there and that's now making the shot a bit more
difficult but I did manage to capture something just as it was coming up so
I'll talk you through that now what we have... very bright ...is a mountain here which
is the main subject of my image here and the beautiful mist just coming down the
valley and sort of just settling in that little area there and it's just looking
absolutely magical like a winter wonderland. The Sun as well just makes it
feel beautiful and gives it that extra wintery Mountain feel and it's just it's
incredible to be here there's a little bit of noise from the road but that's
okay and that is creeping into my image a little bit just cutting off the corner
of my image I may clone that out or I may just leave it because that's the scene
I'm shooting but certainly this it's not the road I'm thinking about. It's giving
such an incredible feel it's gonna be nice and hopefully low in contrast as
that golden light is shining across it's perfectly unspoiled snow it's just so
bright as well, I'm struggling to keep my eyes open as you look at the
surface of the snow as well you just get these sparkling reflections catching the
light and reflecting it back into the camera and it's just adding another
element of interest to the scene it's been a difficult day so far
a lot of time more time than I would have wanted in the car to be honest the
roads are horrendous as well it is making a bit difficult but when you're welcomed
with this at the end of it, it's all very much worth it Like I was saying it was really really busy
down at the car park and there was probably about a hundred photographers
capturing an image of this mountain here today we have trekked up one of the most
difficult sides of a mountain I have ever trekked up. The snow is probably in
this bit about two feet deep we have trekked up to a bit where no one else
has been today over some deer tracks using the poles to feel the way but it
was extremely difficult but now I've got to say look at this it's just been so
worth it the Sun is just teasing the top of the mountain there as it's moving
this way through our scene behind us there and it's just a magical moment
really we've had the drone up as well there are some deer just over there I'll
try and get in nice and close so you can see them as well but it's just an
absolutely magical surrounding so with that I mind I then want to capture it so
I'm trying a couple of things I'm actually shooting back at the same
mountain that I was shooting before. I'm really sorry I don't know the names of
it but it's this one over here the fog keeps rolling in down the valley and
covering the bottom of the image and then there's some trees over this side
that are leading you in from the bottom right-hand corner of the image the road
sort of snakes its way through the image as well and then up into the
mountain and then there's a little bit of the mountain behind me in the image
and the Sun just, just poking out into the image. So I'm using bracketing
because there's a big dynamic range I want to make sure I can capture that
little bit of Sun that is there and then still capture the detail in the
foreground shadow area as well so I think I've managed to do that that
should be a really nice shot once I get it back into the computer later. That's
it really we're just gonna now sit here fly the drones around, enjoy the moment
as the Sun starts to set, with a mate in a spectacular place like this,
nothing better. So what an absolutely spectacular day it
has been difficult at times like I said getting in and out of the car all the
time can be a bit frustrating since we've got out and had a bit of a
difficult hike up this mountain though it has got a lot better I feel a lot
happy about it that bit of exercise getting up high
away from the crowds away from the other photographers is what it's all about for
me and I have enjoyed it immensely I hope you've enjoyed it as well just
