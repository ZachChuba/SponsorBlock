Let's do good work today. Oh! This is... - It's you during the award ceremony.
- Yeah, it's the award ceremony... [Cake showing her in award ceremony outfit] Thank you. I want to take
a picture with it. Thank you. (Dance)    (Dance) [Giddy] [Chung Ha spraying perfume everywhere] (The camera smells nice thanks to her) It smells so nice! I think the purple outfit
and the yellow perfume go so well together. Right? Don't you think so? It smells a little like springtime. It's sweet but not too sweet. There's warmth but it's not too hot. It's like I'm in a pleasant-smelling
flower garden. I think I may have sprayed too much. It feels like I took a spoonful of it. Like I drank it. (Calm) I'll go get changed now. Oh, this thing? I was dancing while
I was prepping an MV. And then I just... I was doing this move. Reality. Reality. Bear paw. [Bear paw] [Transform!] Next! (Ta-da)
Next! - Let's take a Polaroid shot!
- Let's take a Polaroid shot! [Dash!] [You were dancing in
a previous photoshoot as well] I'm always dancing. I can virtually do anything
they ask me to do now. I'm just worried that the photos
would all look the same. [Still, she looks like she got this] This is our last outfit. The last look. Last look. [It sounds like you're saying
entrails (in Korean)] Entrails? Spicy entrails? Sounds delicious! (Stream of consciousness...) Entrails! [All the photoshoot is now over...] [Finally to recording voiceover!] [Finally to recording voiceover!]
Sweet mango and grapefruit essence. Fresh jasmine... Okay! Thank you! [Going home!] Thank you for your great work today!
