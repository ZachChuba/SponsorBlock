I've lusted after many cars before that we've driven particularly the i8 the eye and the model SP 100 d where two cars I lusted after so much but I do lust after this even more than either of those two like this [Music] coming to you live from beautiful la it's not really somewhere around where generally there today we have a very exciting car oh my gosh yes we do well Lamborghini horas the only Lamborghini that JT and I have ever driven yep this is the only one I've really ever cared to drive on I think that's baffling but you only want to drive the SUV I know I mean the other ones they're cool yeah they're they're awesome super cars they're really fast but this is dumb well do you call this a super car or is the rest of your SUV a super sub yeah okay there's a distinction there this is incredibly fast yeah I wouldn't say it's a supercar I don't know it's a Lamborghini you don't consider a Lamborghini a supercar it's not an illness massive supercar that is so fast that is so fast and it's an SUV and it waves of time all right let's get some quick specs out of the way yeah there are 60 in quoted by Lamborghini 3.2 seconds yes the Lamborghini quotes a 3.2 seconds zero to 60 time however people have done this reportedly I've seen online and as quickly as 2.9 seconds yeah which like that's like you're pretty comparable to the Tesla Model X P 100 d yeah and this is a gas Lambo what's a monster it is such a beast but as a monstrous gas-powered car mpg mpg is 12 miles a gallon city and 17 highway my heart fuel economy not crash not o incapacity great 7,000 pounds 7,000 pound towing capacity and you can get an option to get a trailer hitch so you can tow your Lamborghini in your Lamborghini to your tractor yes if you want and you have an Aventador something else that's wild you can use this yeah to tow it if you can afford this car you can afford the gas for it yeah that's all on premium gas too yeah you gonna blow through a lot of gas if you're doing this any more than like a weekend thing yeah what you'll want to do because this is the most comfortable supercar I think it is that ever been this is by far the most comfortable supercar I have ever personally sat in or driven it's incredible when Lamborghini announced that they were making an SUV I was a little like apprehensive about how they would make it look but I have actually done a great job with this oh I totally agree like I don't really like SUVs I like bigger cars that are comfortable and spacious but SUVs are just kind of they look dumb and bloated yeah this thing the proportions are just right like all the lines are perfect they're aggressive the front is so mean look I think it looks like an angry beehive yeah yeah pretty much a weird way this thing this is like I mean Lamborghinis the bull this is like the bull of their lineup it is really this is the most bull like car that they probably make yeah now the interior is just as I think it's actually more stunning the interior is more insane this is the nicest interior of any car I've ever sat in and for clarification again I've never sat in something like a rolls-royce or a Bentley so as far as I know this is the best interior I have ever sat in in a car it in one rolls-royce and it is really nice that's like a lounge you're gonna lounge but this to me is a nicer presentation this is astonishing but this does it does feel a little boy racer oh yeah but it's like cool it's really good local I love it everything about it I mean this it looks like this kind of interior would fit in like a civic type-r oh yeah same with the red the red and the black and then like the little aggressive bits but this has done so much better nothing's cheap like there's Alcantara so nice there's they've got a Lamborghini logo on the passenger side and there's not a sharp edge anywhere on this yeah just little touches like that attention to detail is incredible in this let's get a couple of cons out of the way here it does have gloss black around the center aisle I mean you're not gonna be jabbing and there's there aren't any buttons there so you're not gonna be poking it so you're not gonna get a bunch of fingerprints but there is gloss black there there's gloss black on this around the screen here which you will be touching a lot they've got two screens it does leave like gross fingerprints smudges everywhere which like I'm not the biggest fan of but it looks out of place in a car that's nice yeah but I mean as long as you're just like anal about cleaning it with wipes and stuff I mean it's gonna look great it would look great if it wasn't for the smudgy sure and most people aren't really gonna notice that but if it's your car and you're driving any like everything is perfect except for those fingerprints I was tapping the touchscreen like nothing's happening this is dumb this is stupid you have to actually physically like press on the screen it's like kind of like force touch on a trackpad yeah they're naturally like vibrates yeah you got it right back yeah when so it confirms when you've pressed a button on the touchscreen and once you get that once you figure that out it's pretty responsive nothing stellar but definitely good enough it's not something worth complaining about I like all of this stuff a lot actually I really like the center console my one gripe is that a lot of these things are kind of separated like parks down here to reverses on this paddle thing manuals over here your parking brakes way over here that's a minor minor nitpick though I mean if yeah if you're used to having all your controls on like one dial or one stick yeah this will seem like a little bit of overkill but it's such a nice presentation yeah I can't complain it is just like the theater that Lamborghini pulls off in this car is nominal and like that's really what I think this whole thing is about what any Lamborghini is about it's about the theater yeah you don't need this no one needs of course not this is ridiculous the driving house yes this is like as expensive as a house and we didn't mention that the price of this is $200,000 in retail so base price 200k boom unlike every other Lamborghini this is practical is practical ish you actually have back seats that are genuinely you read of them three seats in the back to normal size and then the one in the middle there that Center thing does come down which is nice if you got just two people in the back yeah cheering put your various cups of chili we're a couple more serious cups of chili and your Lamborghini Hertz in the Hollywood Hills I love it I love it more did you get that pop yeah in the tunnel yeah this is so fun this is big too much fun it really is this is the most fun car I've ever driven yeah anyway [Music] you give up a lot and have been a real supercar like you have to give up a lot of times even stuff like air conditioning and then a infotainment Center but this you get all the benefit of a bigger car like an SUV and you still have the performance you do and speaking of that just the features there's an endless list I feel like basically what I'm going to talk about is this confusing as hell gauge cluster like a millennium from here it it rolls yes it does feel like you're in the Millennium Falcon or you're in a fighter jet or something like that so right now we've been driving in strata mode which is chill mode and it's really a mystery does it yeah okay so it's sure it means Street and it's been chill laughs this feels like I'm driving a Toyota it's very refined it's super pleasant it's it's not jerky or anything this feels like straight-up I have been driving a Toyota SUV that it just happens to be ludicrously fast and ludicrously looking everything it's so mean when you put it in a Corsa and that's track mode yeah would you track an SUV probably not but yeah you could you could this is a trackable SUV which is great it makes it even angrier even louder even more aggressive the coolest thing I think that you can't see is the gauge cluster literally turns into a video game looking cluster it doesn't show you well it does show you the speed but it predominantly shows you the Rev yeah counter your rpms and it shows you your power torque with like a chart of how much power you got as gauge there in the corner - so the last one is nev nev e and f a and that's snow mode or also off-road mode so when you set it into this it shows you like an angle departure that you're at like you're off-roading or rock crawling okay that's great what you take this wrong wrong no but absolutely but you could you can so this is the all-around just insane car okay so like you can drive it and it's a chill Toyota and a chill mode you can make it an insane track animal monster when you put into a Corsa and you can take it off okay technically thing is so Duncan literally setting it to Nev a mode and setting it to off-road I love it that is so dumb everything about this is so stupid and I I love that Lamborghini made this okay I would open it up here yeah do it this is a good stretch hold on go from sight dropped a second in it Oh got a shift there it's funny will complain at you yeah so it's red lines only six and a half thousand okay only six and a half thousand to that SUV but whatever that's my main complaint I want it I wish you could hold it a little bit longer in those low gears because it just pulls and pulls and pulls and feels so powerful and even closing the doors and this thing is an experience it's such a solid thunk and but not like it's just a heavy door it's like I don't know it closed down and it seals you in the door feels like a bank vault door yeah it feels like you're just like off we go in Lamborghini and the Hollywood Hills oh yeah I forgot about this as soon as you drive the seat belt like automatically like tugs you and makes you all snug in your seat it's such a nice touch it's just a cool I don't know alright your security very unnecessary but I like it yeah what a little bit of engineering how many months did that take to get that just arrived via Italians yeah man you've also got analog controls for your suspension your steering and your ride quality your ride stiffness yep you can do up that really no you can set all of those yeah which is cool and you've got different modes so you gonna let us do it now yes its sportive smooth and medium we've got in sport of everything of course and even in sportive it's not I mean this roads ok a little bumpy but you're not getting jostled you're not getting beaten today at all like we've definitely driven other sports cars like the Lotus Evora and the BMW i8 that feel a lot harsher this is so comfy in comparison to any of those yeah it's very comfortable the fact that they could do that make this so comfortable even in the sport mode well duh it's phenomenal this is a masterpiece of engineering I totally agree on top of that just like other features that like I said earlier there's almost limitless features there's a sunroof yes that you can open this giant - it's huge though goes all the way back keep going keep going keep going still going okay there it is so you've got the the screen which comes across which is nice and that blocks out a lot of the Sun well you can also open this up one touch here and you get a nice and you go yeag open eric's it's almost like a pseudo convertible almost it's a little it's smaller than the P 100 D I would say yes it is but it's still really nice just driving this for the short time that I have I think I would keep this an automatic most of the time honestly I think I would - it's honestly really good at automatic yeah it's great its quick its responsive it knows what you want generally depending on the mode you're in yeah right now the steering wheel is so loose yeah but that's what it once I mean that's what it thinks you want and it's it's generally pretty smart yep I love it and then as soon as you start going it tightens up like alright now is my chance to go fast but I do like like this doesn't seem like it attracts as much attention as a regular like an aircon does I totally offended or and this has I almost the same level of performance yeah this sounds like the same speed as Oricon does and yet and it's it's a practical SUV and Ekta co2 practical air quotes and it doesn't attract like half as much attention oh yeah not even close I mean if you rev it yeah I mean we rev this outside the house the air B&B or stay out people like poke their heads Oh what was that and I think both of us we are the type of people that we like not having a lot of attention while we're driving because I'd rather just enjoy the car yeah I would rather enjoy the performance and enjoy the car itself rather than have people come up and like just harass you about it yeah or like I don't know just anything oh there we go pro cameras yeah yeah oh yeah yeah you can get those for the Gov Best Buy just Best Buy yeah good luck well interesting to note about that entire thing she wanted to know about our cameras not they are the Lamborghini that were here tried look like blast pass through this she'll realize what we're driving she what she only wanted to know about the GoPros okay so starting us out his performance which naturally we really oh my god so nine-and-a-half neither a half on perform and the only things I mean they're little that I would dock it for it is an SUV it is a little top-heavy you can't take it around corners all that fast and it doesn't have that instant feedback you get from yeah like something like a P 108 I will give it a 9 because it's still the handling is a little weird and not they're not weird but like it's accommodating which is what you don't expect that in a supercar it's not as like our family completely precise as like Aaron Cohen I assume would be or an Aventador which again I have never driven but I'm making assumptions here and I'm also talking it a little bit because it does have a bit of lag yeah only you hit on the accelerator unlike the Tesla Model S which is like that instant just hurls you back in your seat yeah this spools up for a second and then it throws you packing your seeds like that and man does it really throw you back in your seat like it really just like blew when it happens so you feel better about this than the Model S P 100 E right because I know that terrified that scared me a lot but this does this when it ramps up to that speed and I have time to like for my brand to process what's happening I have a great time yeah 100 D was a little too fast and I'd be interested to do it again yeah I know what I'm in for yeah and see but yeah this to me is more fun maybe it's good Leslie repairs you a little bit yeah because it does like prepare you with that second where it's like it's like I'm wrapping really are sound you don't know it's gonna come yeah yeah okay practicality that next which i think is actually I mean for a super this is the most practical supercar on the plant this no I think it is that's a blunder Ferrari Shooting Brake the what the wagon the Ferrari wagon this is more practical than you think so definitely this is death more practical than that I I think so the only way they would knock it for is that few look yeah like the fuel economy is trash twelve cities seventeen highway that's garbage with premiums really bad but I mean other than that I think this is actually quite practical and I'm going to give it an eight because of that Wow yeah I think I'm gonna give it a seven and a half alright because the fuel economy is trash but man otherwise this car is great it's super practical next up is the fun factor which is I think this is I've never had more fun in a car I've ever driven isn't it I think you might be right with that one I'm trying to think closer to the i8 the closest I can think of is the I ate the áfourá and the Model S t100 D however the Model S P 100 D in my opinion is kind of a one-trick pony yeah yes it is really really really stupid fast but that's about all you can do with it yeah it's a zero is really thinking yeah that's it I know the technology and handling is cool in that and I'm probably gonna get hate and the comments were saying that yeah from Tesla fanboys but it's a good car it's a good call now knocking it but yeah but I do have more fun in this I Jamie really straight up have more fun in this than I do in the Model S P one underneath I agree and I assume I've never driven the Model X but I do assume I would have more fun I think this is a horse fun car than the model ax oh yeah it's just about as fast they're roughly the same speed zero to 60 time but this has just so much more presentation in like craziness to it I see a trickle I love what a presentation I'm gonna get it up I mean I'm gonna give it a 9 and a half almost as fun as it gets I think I'm gonna give it a little less I'm gonna give it a 9 yeah but I do agree this is almost as fun as it gets I think for any reasonable person this is really all the fun you ever need in a car the only thing that I would rate as more fun than this would be stuff like like proper supercars like a Huracan or an offended or or that's just built to do what this does really well even better yeah to me it's alright this car is stunningly cool that to me yeah to us to car people people who know car I mean I'm sure there are a lot of people who do know cars are like this thing is stupid yes I hate it but to me I'm like that's the coolest SUV I've ever seen it is the coolest SUV ever that's the tire the title for this video and yeah I maybe have found the coolest SUV ever ever it's not flashy like it's a little flashy but it's not like super flashy like an icon or a defend Edoras we're like you see a Eric on an offended order you immediately know what it is yeah they are always on a hundred percent just loud like this is also like the color is silver it's kind of bland and like so you look at it like you don't necessarily know that this is a crazy Lamborghini yeah I'm gonna write this more for me than for the people who don't know what it is and I'm going to do the opposite okay cool place so for me this car is a seven and a half that's interesting because I was thinking I'm giving it a 7 huh so now I'm much different yeah but I do think like I mean there's definitely like I don't know there's calmer stuff yeah I'm explain like there's there's cooler stuff you could drive quality is next which i think is exceptional the italians just do such an amazing job on their super car interiors and this isn't an exception it's fantastic it's absolutely fab that's not straight up I'm gonna give this a 10 a 10 I don't think I'm going to go that far I'm not gonna go quite with a 10 I'm going to go actually it seems significantly less I'm going to go with an eight-and-a-half yeah my reasoning for that instead of giving it a 10 is because one I do think Rolls Royces and Bentley's are better than this and I do want to give those higher scores second is long-term reliability I think this could have service could have reliability I mean it probably will okay you can leave your knees out reliability I didn't take that into account I'm gonna dock it at I'm gonna take it down to nine okay because they are notorious for having some issues there and then next up is value which i think is kind of hard because yes this does cost as much as a house this is two hundred thousand dollars which is why all the same but holy cow this thing is so cool I never thought I would say this is worth every penny of $200,000 I've been climbed to agree like this is I actually think worth $200,000 it feels like it's worth $200,000 like from the moment you open the door it's worth it yeah but it's still a lot of money it's a ton of money and so much I can't probably give it much more than a six and a half I think that's a proud where I have to give the value yeah it's a goofy car it probably won't have that long of a run honestly but how exciting is it to think okay that's like the base price of this is $200,000 how much is this going to depreciate in like five years oh yeah this drop to like 130 or a hundred thousand 50 percent depreciation which is not unheard of for cars like this I would snap that up man honestly I love this thing I would roadtrip this thing roadtrip the salary obscenely expensive that would be with our 12 mpg yeah I'm gonna give it you're right it's a six and a half I can't I said I can't in good conscience give it anything higher than that right I just can't do higher than that yeah all right with that we're gonna add it all together and then do the average score [Music] average score is a massive forty eight point two five Wow which is by far the highest rated car we've ever reviewed on the show so far yeah and that's got a hold the record for a while I think so I think and you know what we say this with a lot of cars but man does this one deserve it yeah this this is my favorite car we've ever reviewed on this show and like I said my verdict is if you have $200,000 sitting around and you want to slap your kids to school and back and you lecture got extended to just do it just go and do it just go ahead and get it so I can live vicariously you please you will not regret it man what a car if this is your first time watching thank you for stopping by we hope you enjoyed this episode as much as we enjoyed making it stick around so we can make more of these we've
