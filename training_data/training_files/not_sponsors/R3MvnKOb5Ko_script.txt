and so now it's time I think to to add a second focus which is in the home you know people like to use their iPods not just individually but you know with their families or in groups in the home in the living room the kitchen the ski cabin wherever and and there are some products on the market that help you do that they're powered speakers there they're all reasonably priced this is a probably the you know one of the better quality ones the bose one sells for $299 has been a big hit but the problem with these products is that none of them really offer home stereo quality well you might get one of these you're not getting rid of your home stereo you know because the quality level just isn't quite there and you know what what is home stereo quality you could ask well if you're an audiophile what you'd say is is four things one if you close your eyes there's a soundstage around the speaker's you don't the speakers disappear acoustically and there's like a stage around the speaker's where you can hear the performers performing that's much larger than the speaker's right so a large soundstage the second thing maybe the most important in some ways is precise imaging and separation each instrument you can you can place in space individually right each instrument you can you can imagine where it is in that soundstage and it's not they're not all muddled together right they're separate they're clear and you can almost imagine you can almost see where they are if you close your eyes in that soundstage the third thing is a wide frequency range you know you want to be able to have great bass but you also want to be able to hear you know the highest frequencies as well and lastly you do want room-filling power but without Distortion and most of these products you know a lot of products really distort when you crank the volume so these four things and there's some higher end products of higher-end stereos that certainly do better at these than the powered speakers that the iPod has in its economy today you know here's a higher-end Bose product that's that's certainly much better you know there a lot of stereos like this this is a Denon one with some speakers on it that works pretty well we're going to introduce one today that has some of the attributes of the iPod speakers that are out today but really the home stereo quality that we see in products like this that are very competitive with products like this and even exceeds some of them so today we're introducing the iPod hi-fi and it's a companion product to the iPod it's really home stereo reinvented because what we see is your music is not in CDs in your cabinet anymore it's on your iPod and so your stereo is really ready to move to an iPod based stereo if we could just get the quality up on the rest of the system and we're doing that today with iPod hi-fi this is iPod hi-fi take the grill off it's a three driver system this is what it looks like from the top a little bit and one of the keys is right on the top we've got a place to plug in your iPod we've got a universal iPod dock built right into the top of it and we've got these plug ins for every iPod that has a connector on it that we've ever shipped and so in our two most recent ones there's the one for the Nano there's the one for the fifth-generation iPod but there's inserts that come with the iPod hi-fi for every iPod we've ever shipped with a dock connector and there's even an auxilary input on the back so if you have a shuffle and you go out and buy a cable you can plug your shuffle in too if you want to and you can see the volume controls and everything right on the top so you can actually just drop your iPod right in it whether it's a nano or fifth generation iPod now let's take a look inside this thing is a lot more than it looks like on the surface you can see the handles by the way built-in handles right on the side let's take a look inside though there's a lot going on in here the first thing we see let's take a look at the back we've integrated not only the electronics but the power supply right in there so there's no power brick it just plugs right into the wall because you get tired of all these power bricks dangling around especially you know in your kitchen in places where you see them right out in the open and you can power this off six D size batteries so if you want to take this out you know to the Cabana or the pool and listen to it out there you just pop in six D cells and go out and listen to it for several hours outside and get great sound wherever you are then we've got two eighty millimeter mid-range drivers and these are in a sealed acoustic suspension so these are sealed chambers to get the most out of these mid-range drivers they're actually kind of wide range drivers that handle from the base all the way up and now the base system we've got 130 millimeter dual voice coil woofer and it is a ported bass reflex design so you can see the ports coming right out the front we get great bass out of this thing and it doesn't distort when you crank it up a lot of work went into this so this thing's a lot more under the hood than it seems like and on top of that of course the universal dock connector and the integrated handles and again to make great sound you've got to have a sealed enclosure that doesn't vibrate this thing is a sealed resin enclosure and it's really really good and when you hear it you'll be hearing the results of partially that so a lot in here we've also done a lot of work integrating it with the iPod one of the little things we did was we made it so that when an iPod plugs into this there's a little software update going out for the iPods it actually puts a speaker menu item in the main menu right software updates going out it's already out great even better and speaker main menu item and pops up and when you look under there you can set the tone control for flat or you can boost the treble you can boost the bass you can have the backlight always go off or always stay on while things are playing and then there's a large album art which I like you can basically rather than watching this you can just have the screen go black and put up the album art and leave it on which is really nice in the fifth generation iPod especially so integration with the iPod of course you control it with the Apple remote the same exact Apple remote we use on the computers so you'll be quite familiar with it hopefully so this is the iPod hi-fi let's take a look at some of its features again 280 millimeter mid-range drivers 130 millimeter dual voice coil woofer ported this bass reflex design so we get some great bass out of this universal iPod dock apple remote we've got auxilary and spit F optical audio inputs and integrated power supply so there's no brick battery-powered and integrated handles so we're pretty pretty happy with this and so home stereo quality we think we can deliver this really for the first time in the iPod ecosystem and how much does this cost well you know this bose product cost over $1000 these kinds of products you know $800 and up a lot of them cost over $1000 and we're delivering audio quality that is absolutely competitive with these products in the new iPod hi-fi now we're going to price it really more in the iPod economy space at $349 349 dollars and it goes on sale today so you're probably saying oh by the way here's one right here it's really nice so you're probably saying okay so when can I hear it right well rather play it in here because this is a slightly larger room than it was designed for we actually have some rooms upstairs that we want you to visit we have a kitchen that we've set up we have a dorm room that's set up we have a living room that's set up and we have a study that is set up so some of these have all the products in them some of these just have the iPod hi-fi but you can listen to the iPod hi-fi in all of them and you will get a real feel for what this sounds like and so right after we're done here we'd like all of you to go upstairs and take a listen so iPod hi-fi it's home stereo reinvented for the iPod aged and I got to tell you this thing is so good I've been using one for the last month keeping it you know little cloth over at home and stuff I'm an audiophile I've had stereos costing uh but I won't save it you think I was crazy but a lot and I'm actually getting rid of my stereo that cost a lot to go with these things they have phenomenal sound and I think a lot of our customers are going to have more than one of these around their house they are really really good
