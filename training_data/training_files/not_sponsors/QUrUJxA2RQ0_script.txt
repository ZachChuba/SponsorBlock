this video is sponsored by Skillshare I don't know how many jokes I made in the past about learning through osmosis before I actually learn what it is but now that I do know the jokes everyone makes kind of make sense a little bit kind of oh gosh so if you stick around long enough I will try and show you what happens during osmosis using my favorite vegetable and yes I'm gonna call them vegetables sure Jay the song they've been through enough already and that is the humble spud so osmosis is basically all about balancing out solvents and solutes I solve into something generally a liquid that is able to dissolve something should probably called it as a dis solvent oh my gosh the solvent is already a worry oh my god I never heard that word before apparently means the same thing and then a solute is something that can be dissolved in a solvent or a dissolvent so when you will stick to solvent because that's like the main term so when uses all a solute such as salt or sugar in a solvent such as water then you get a solution and if you're not part of the solution you're part of the precipitate yeah how many other people's chemistry teachers made that joke raise your hand anyways osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane and a semipermeable membrane is a membrane that allows certain things to pass through easily it's selective up the things that last through so cell membranes kind of act like security guards for yourselves they control what comes in and out things like water molecules can pass through it really easily without any extra energy required such as ATP but some other things floating around like solder sugar molecules can't but that's not to say that only water can pass through a cell membrane cells have got transport proteins on them that recognize things that the cell might need to be transported in or out and that's how other things such as ions get through but that's a whole nother kettle of fish so let's pretend we've got a membrane over here and we've got water on both sides one side of the membrane has a lot of salt unless water and the other side has less salt and more water the water will move the crosses concentration gradient so it will move from where there is a concentration of water or where there are more water molecules and less salt to an area where there is less water and more salt to add a few terms into all of this a solution with a high concentration of solutes is said to be hypertonic it's got a high concentration of solutes a hypotonic solution has a relatively lower concentration of solutes and then solutions of equal concentrations are said to be isotonic so a hypertonic solution where all of its solutes is gonna attract lots of water a hypotonic solution on the other side does not have lots of solutes and will probably lose water quickly to a hypertonic solution and then an isotonic solution on either side of a membrane means that water will stay equal while it goes back and forth across a membrane it could be helpful to think that when you have say a salty ol bag of crisps your brain is going to tell you that you need to drink water so you've just put a whole bunch of salt in your body and you want to sort that out biding water a lot about analogy somewhat in a somewhat similar way if you put a potato right if you put a bit of potato in salty water the water in the potato will come out and try and sort out the saltwater bonds which we're gonna try and do now okay so what I've got here is one glass that has salt and on one glass that is just plain water which I'm going to remember by having a little water thing there I've got two little bits of potato and what I'm gonna do is put each one in a glass of water or else a glass of a salty solution what should happen what we hope will happen is that the blader that goes into the salt water the fact that there's more technically more salt or water in the potato it's going to come out and into the salt because it's like a higher concentration of water in here then in the salt water so it's going to come out and go into the water and then that means that this should do its weight and on this one because there's more water outside of the potato it should go into the potato and this potato should gain weight so we're going to weigh them up first and this one weighs 80 no 19 grams and this one weighs 18 grams so let's try again 1918 so we're gonna put the 19 gram one into the salt water now we're gonna put the 18 gram on into third clean water and we're going to leave that for about an hour and then you will happened you okay so it has now been an hour assault one was 19 grams and the water one was 18 so now we're gonna see if this has changed from it's been 19 17 so it's lost two grounds and the water 119 grams so it's gained a gram 20 grams gained two grams so this one has lost weight as we expected it to being in salt water and this one has gained weight so the salt one has lost two grams and the water one game two grams so the salt one has lost water was two grams of water out of it and this one game to come to water this video is brought to you by forward slash science
