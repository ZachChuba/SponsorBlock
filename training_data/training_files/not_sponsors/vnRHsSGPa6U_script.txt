months of Skillshare absolutely free when people think of great musicians we tend to place them in a specific historic period or define them as a monolithic archetype Elvis Presley is the king Johnny Cash is the man in black Bob Dylan the voice of a generation but there are some artists that we just can't put our finger on and I think no artist embodies that better than Neil Young Neil Young has meant a dozen different things to his audiences he's worked with Rick James and David Crosby he was a hippie icon but also the godfather of grunge his name dropped Marilyn Monroe and Johnny Rotten and been named dropped by Lynyrd Skynyrd and Kurt Cobain through a half-century career Jung has put his fingers all over popular music leading many of us to ask the same questions who exactly is Neil Young and what exactly is his place in our cultural landscape let's take a closer look perhaps the reason it's so difficult to define Neil Young is because of the contradictions in his music ask somebody to describe Young's music and they'll probably give you one of two descriptions the first is a calm subdued music acoustic guitars thoughtful folk with the country damaged the second is a roaring loud artist sludgy guitars and low heavy mix of course yung himself has leaned into this dichotomy before it's the driving theme behind the rust never sleeps live album that album features wanna COO stick side from young on his own followed by a grungy electric side with Crazy Horse the point is driven home by the first and last tracks on the album the songs are alternate universe version of each other yin-yang pair showing how young can consolidate two sides of himself into one and this is one of the things that gives young his strength other artists have oscillated between acoustic and electric Dylan's bringing it all back home is famous for just that but if you can do it with Neil Young's cohesion Young's acoustic music seems to tap into a rustic escape to a pastoral countryside but he's also always been at the cutting edge of technology this is evident on the controversial trans a strange electronic tinged album young adopted quickly to digital and was even on the forefront of the high fidelity movement with his own audio player the poem but it goes beyond the tech Neil Young is also woven into the fabric of two different countries he's revered in his native Canada and often slips references of his home country into his lyrics the opening lines of helpless might be the most famous example and while Neil Young is name-dropped beside Canadian greats like Leonard Cohen and Gore Downey his music has also tied him to the cultural history of the United States though he didn't write it Neil Young's guitar on Buffalo Springfield's for what it's worth provided a soundtrack to the American 60s counterculture movement four years after that song young would write a protest song against the backdrop of one of America's bleakest historical moments it was Young's lyrics that propelled Crosby Stills Nash and young Ohio a historical document of the Kent State [Music] and that political edge is something that has remained in young's music regardless of time or sound in his solo work Young was a staunch critic of racism in the American South both southern man and Alabama tackled that issue Hannah neil young's protest songs go outside of just one era though he's been writing political songs across several historical periods one of his most famous protest songs rockin in the free world was released two decades after young's time in the 60s counterculture rocking in the free world is a rally against George HW Bush's Americans it even references the elder Bush's inaugural address and Neil Young would stick around long enough to criticize HW Bush's son too in 2006 he sang let's impeach the president about george w bush part of an entire album protesting the war on terror neil young can do anger with the best of them but he can also do calm introspection this has stuck with him across several points in his career and several bands in his early days in the Canadian folk scene he wrote sugar mail a calm reflection on age this is a theme that would return in 1970 to moon may [Music] his time with Crosby Stills Nash and young saw him sing of escaping to the country on helpless and those country themes returned on 1992's Harvest Moon and despite being twenty years apart heart of gold and one of these days work perfectly together as reflections on Young's life and his relationships with all of these different styles and influences you'd think that Neil Young might fit alongside David Bowie in the chameleon archetype but he's not quite like that Bowie's hippie songs of the 60s are a far cry from his experimental jazz of 2016 but for Neil Young 2017 s the visitor still contains all of his signatures it opens on a heavy grunge rant against Donald Trump but two tracks later he's calmed down to the harmonica driven almost always almost always shows the subdued acoustic guitar work that has guided the calmer parts of Neil Young's career though people aren't quick to put him up with Hendrix or Clapton when it comes to the all-time great guitarists young can hold his own against the best of them on both acoustic and electric guitar some of Young's finest moments come in the form of open songs that let his guitar Arrangements breathe tracks like down by the river and Cortez the killer show that Jung is capable of stretch of long passionate soldiers in the end the reason we don't have any clear idea of Neil Young may simply be because he defies definition he's a Canadian icon who has helped shape American history he's an outwardly angry political rocker equally capable of calm reflection he's a legendary solo artist who's just as well-known as part of several bands he was a hippie in the 60s a country singer in the 70s and a grunge pioneer in the 80s but through all these contradictions there's something consistent at Neil Young's core he manages to wrangle all of these different identities into one unique figure distinct to anyone who knows him upon just a few seconds of listening so try as we may there's really only one monolithic identity that we can apply to Neil Young above all else Neil Young is and always has been Neil Young listening to Neil Young has two months free and
