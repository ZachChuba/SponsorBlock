so I got an email from Becky she says hi Leon got someone for you to check out uk-based Antonella the reviewer used to be straight-up indecent now flogging these god-awful body detox foot pad things which claim all sorts see what you think cheers Becky body detox footpads you say that right in my wheelhouse hello everybody welcome back to a brand new casket full of condoms my name is Leon lush and this is my sidekick Nigel of the [ __ ] and we are just very pleased and thankful to have you here for a little bit today so I went ahead and checked out Becky's recommendation and headed over to antonella's Facebook page just a real treat here this is Antonella the uncensored reviewer she's got 1.3 million fob Facebook page likes I guess which I don't really know how many Klout tokens that equates to not really I'm more of a YouTube Twitter guy I imagine that's pretty good I think she makes a living doing this like I don't know as you scroll down her page you realize it's she's very personality driven her brand she just does a bunch of random review style things about products that seem completely unrelated there's very pretty much no editing at all the Lighting's pretty garbage I think it's the UK accent honestly that probably gives her most of her leverage in telling you about it so we're I am sure yeah exactly what they like I've always believed if you're an internet personality from the UK right it's like you have a cheat code when you start now like even if you're doing nothing you're still baseline kind of entertaining because of how funny sound right I've been using these as your norm on a massive health journey to get really healthy and really sick so I have been using these overnight to dry toxins from my bottom I mean you talk about relatable I too I'm also always on a journey to get massively healthy and massively fit and I just forget about diet and exercise and all that [ __ ] right I'm thinking right off the bat first order of business grab a couple of these pads throw them on the bottom of my feet and watch the toxin just fall out of my body you're talking weight loss you're talking curing disease this is the [ __ ] and this is the move but before we get into the meat and potatoes I want to talk about who Antonella is a little bit more you know I don't have really much of an issue with people that do reviews and stuff to give their honest reviews on products and maybe you know push some links for things that they enjoy using or whatever but the more and more you look at her page you really realized that she's just chilling absolute horseshit in order to push a couple of affiliate links and it's this that this video is the one that really gives you the full picture on what she's doing come back with a new review so I am going to review the belly wing my wonder patch pulse to lose weight on you tummy than me Nelly v my wave is supposed to be an absolutely fantastic wonder patch for going mad for it in Korea it's as cheap as chips and it's a safe way apparently to lose weight the Wonder patch you just slapped that baby on your fat stomach and after eight hours you have a new career as an Instagram model and best of all you can keep throwing double cheeseburgers down you throw it at 3 a.m. after a night full of binge drinking it's just pretty neat anyways let's see how it works out for ho little heads-up would have been nice Nelly 5 belly's Christ on a bike I have not oh man I haven't heard that before that is my definitely my new favorite saying anyway she measured the circumference of her belly and clearly just a lot of quality control no room for possible error here no no way she slaps that baby on and then eight hours later where our 54 so we've actually with one complication lost three inches I have no words I have no words Wow and yeah the more times you use it the more often you see results better results but you have lost three inches over the course of one day so yeah I definitely say click the link above and try it for yourself yeah so clearly Nellie five bellies has abandoned any shred of credibility moving forward but let's see what her facebook fans think of this review hmm the reviews on Amazon are not great I use these over a year ago left a big kind of burn mark on my tummy the size of the pad you stick on and the mark is still there now a year later is three inches it's great Antonelli you're adorable I'm gonna try Thanks my [ __ ] sheep just ordered I wonder if you can wrap them completely around your body I'm sure you can Jackie just make sure you order a bunch put it on every little ass [ __ ] into your skin why not lose inches everywhere so now that we have a better understanding of the deluded reality in which some of these people are living let's get back to this idea that slapping a pad on your feet overnight will somehow pull toxins out of your body by the way can we just acknowledge how much of a marketing buzzword toxin is like people don't need to know anything else right if I told you you know what do you stick this pad on your feet overnight and you'll may be healthier they'd be like that sounds ridiculous but the second you say oh stick this pad on your seat and it pulls toxins out of your body you've got crunchy idiots lining up around the block to get a hold of these things Oh toxins these tape toxins out of my body well toxins are related to cancer and other bad things get the toxins out Oh I put the bomb every single night ripped them off in the morning after 8 to 12 hours depending how much you like to sleep I'm usually eight hours and the stuff that's on them in the morning it's absolutely vile take note of that common you know the stuff that's on them in the morning is absolutely vile because that's part of the drawers you get to visually see these toxins they've been sucked out of your body and this is important we'll come back to that don't disturb me oh you got you pound on the stove and you literally literally I just pulp it home I think come on this sham products aside the accent That's Entertainment 101 right there you don't even know that the pads working on drawing all that horrible auxins um I'll see you in the morning and sure yeah what's up bothering me fate what's been drawn out overnight oh so she goes to bed wakes up the next day and this is her reaction and review of how they work let's see what toxins we removed so that even though I vile and disgusting it makes me feel a little bit like being sick in my own mouth that's right Vinny oh my god look at the docs I can't believe she's even alive was that many jobs that must have been flowing through her bloodstream thank God she put the foot pads on so all the toxins could get sucked out and be green and gross all over that pad these things must really work wonders thank god she's safe now I apologize if my sarcasms have been over the top and comes off a bit judgey I'm not a doctor and I haven't yet to try these myself but fortunately with a quick google search we can realize that every single educated person in the world realizes that these are in fact to just scam products that are meant to prey on people that are easily influenced by words like detox and toxins in restoring balance there is no evidence of any bodily response to detox pads most claims about these types of products include removing heavy metals toxins and even fat from the body they do not there has not been any published scientific studies to prove that any thing happens to the body while using detox footpads so those are just a couple statements from doctors I was able to find online if he did a little more digging you'd be able to find about a hundred million more that say exactly the same thing now you might be sitting at home thinking Leon you have some nerve talking all this smack about my detox footpads without even trying them for yourself well fear not because I went ahead and purchased myself an 8 pack let's take a look alright guys so I got my ultimate foot detox in the mail and I'm just thrilled I have to apologize for the raspy voice and your skin over sicknesses the timing couldn't be more perfect because I I plan to wake up you know after getting rid of the toxins in my body through the soles of my feet hopefully a hundred percent healthy and they'll definitely be some restored balance going on so I'm very excited and apparently it also cures scurvy aids and a leaky anus as well so that's just an added bonus so I mean look out toxins it smells terrible literally you just pop it out I see kind of burns a little bit I'm not sure if that's good but I imagine it's just the toxins screaming for their life am i right [Music] alright anyways I'll see you tomorrow [Music] hey guys good morning it's the moment of truth as you can tell I smell fantastic I feel great already so ooh look at that you see it turned green here so it must you can actually see the precancerous toxins just being shuttled right out of the sole of my foot it's really incredible how I feel I feel great I mean that was just last night and I am biting my tongue talk about a transformation just look at this look at the glow right here anal leakage gone depression what's that oh [ __ ] I even got an erection this morning without having to use my usual MDMA and viagra combo I just oh my god it's insane I mean you saw the green stuff on the bottom of those things toxins toxins imagine all these years those were floating around my bloodstream Alden my back [ __ ] I can't even talk I'm so excited so toxins were holding me back from my real potential you saw the green [ __ ] on the pad that was in my blood and now I feel like [ __ ] Santos I mean there's no way that the green slime that shows up on these is the morning is just a product of you know the [ __ ] that's inside of this little pouch right here reacting with moisture because of course when you put this on your foot it's trapping your pores and your foot sweats overnight there's no no it's definitely toxins it's it's hundred percent those that that green slime was just in my blood streets and I'll prove it to you okay I took an unused pad I put it on this plate and I'd opened a fresh spring water and just poured a little bit of that spring water onto the pad to introduce a little moisture as if you know it was foot sweat and let me tell you I let it sit for 12 hours and here it is and it's oh wait a second oh that's the same green slime that was on my it's the same green slime those on my foot and that was just from [ __ ] I've been I've been scammed they're brilliant disgusting to take off and see what's on them but at least it's not in my body now comfy to wear also oh my god I've only done one night but felt so much better I'm going to order more I used them they are amazing on my second lot now really good product I've tried these they are gray who's these last night was amazed at the stuff that came out in the comments go on and on and on it is just jarring to me how easily people are willing to abandon common sense around this kind of this herd mentality around certain products like this on the internet I mean this is case in point a demonstration of how powerful the placebo effect really is like this one youtuber oh my auntie she tried detox footpads for five days and had this to say near the end of her experience yes you nailed it that is exactly what it is a placebo effect a beneficial effect produced by a placebo drug or treatment which cannot be attributed to the properties of the placebo itself ie the footpad and must therefore be due to the patient's belief in that treatment there's so many companies making millions of dollars selling products just like this one because people so badly want to believe that you can stick a pad on your foot that contains bamboo vinegar powder green tea powder dextran vegetable fiber chitin - Moline and vitamin C and that that's gonna cure all of your ailments by sucking toxins out of the bottom of your foot honest to god I could probably sell a sriracha glove detox program and make like a cool million dollars in 2019 so for $29.99 I will send you one thing of sriracha and this winter glove you just want to open up the sriracha top here then just open up that glove and just start letting her rip baby oh yeah give it a good 10 to 15 seconds easily want to make sure that gloves really filling up with sriracha and as soon as you've done that you just want to slide that glove right on Oh ultimate coverage and you're probably thinking yourself Leon this seems like kind of a scam but let me tell you the secret it pulls out the toxins that's right listen you heard it here the science speaks for itself you put the sriracha glove on toxins just start screaming out of your body I mean everything you can think of that is cured you're gone you're healthier you're younger all the above thing you just use the now as a youtuber myself as youtuber economy if you guys can do me a favor if you haven't subscribed yet it would mean the world if you did go ahead and leave a comment and before you go if you wouldn't mind just grabbing two of these ultimate foot pads I actually have a spare you could use take those puppies off slap them on the bottom of your feet sleep for 12 hours wake up the next day pull it off and if you see those toxins you look down there and you see those gross nasty toxins that got sucked out of your body you rejoice because you have been cured in the second you're done rejoicing you stand up out of your chair and you hip thrusts that [ __ ] like button for me thank you guys so much we'll see in the next one peace [Music]
