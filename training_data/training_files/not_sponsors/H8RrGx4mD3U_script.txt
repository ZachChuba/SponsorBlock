a few weeks ago I took a break from my usual pretentious video essays that I make and decided to do a more practical tutorial about Photoshop and I got such a positive response from it so many people saying they found it really helpful that I decided to just knock out another one because I've got loads of these tips so here are 25 more Photoshop tips tricks hacks and techniques for you [Music] so in keeping with the tradition sap on my last video before we jump into tip number one I'm going to show you something weird and pointless that Photoshop can do and this one is in your interface settings in your preferences so on a PC you go to edit and preferences on a Mac you go to Photoshop preferences an interface so here in your appearance box you can select your color theme and you can change how dark or light the interface is but if you hold alt and shift or option shift on a Mac when you click these these turn it to toast but if you're not happy with toast if you hold command or control on PC they turn into coffee and like the banana tool in the last video I have absolutely no idea what the point of this is so the first thing I'm going to show you is feature called droplets and this is a feature that creates a little icon that you can keep on your desktop or in a folder somewhere and it will apply a Photoshop action to file simply by dragging them to that icon without having to go into Photoshop and go to automate and all that normal stuff so let me show you how this works so the first shop you go to file and to automate and create droplets and I'll bring up this dialog box so under this section here in titles play we have a list of all the actions I've created and I've created a set called Photoshop tips and within that I'm going to select this action here called Instagram and this is an action I've set up that will resize my images and put a board around them how I like to have them when I upload to Instagram so I'm going to send that to my desktop and click OK so if I go to my desktop I've got this little icon here that is the droplet and it's called Instagram I've got this folder called portraits for Instagram here and here we can see all my portraits they're all very large and they are not ready for Instagram yet but all I need to do now is drag this portraits for Instagram folder to this droplet icon and you can see these resizing so now it's applied the action to that whole folder without having to go into Photoshop and do loads of stuff I can just keep that on my desktop and every time I want an image for Instagram I can just drag the folder or the image to that droplet and it will create something Instagram ready for me this next one is a nice little one and it's how to identify a font in an image so I'm just going to take this easyJet image here and to make the type a bit more legible I'm going to crop it using the perspective crop tool then we go to the type menu and go match font it brings up this little dialog box here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag this around here and here we go Cooper black which is the font there you can download that from the Adobe cloud and use it in your image so this next one is to be used sparingly it's quite destructive and it's quite temperamental but if you just do a quick mock-up or something it's a really quick way to change the color of something this is the color replacement brush so say you want to change this easyJet Orange to something like blue like that or something I'm just going to cycle through my brushes right shift and B this is the color replacement brush recommend my brush a bit bigger and I'm just going to paint in the orange areas here and you can see that is nicely changing that to blue and that's done so this next one is something I do that I find makes my layers easier to navigate so when you've got a document like this I've got all these w's here and they're all on separate layers and the default Photoshop view just shows it like this but if you go to this little icon here and go to panel options what you can do is you can firstly change the thumbnail size but secondly and more importantly I think is you can change the thumbnail contents to layer bounds and what that will do is crop the thumbnail of the layer to only the contents of the layer and not the whole layer so it makes it much easier to see what's going on of course you can change these options as you go to best see the document you're working on but this is my personal preference I find for most documents so number 5 is a way I like to fix skin tones in Photoshop and this is a variation on the matching colors with curves that I did in the last video so let me show you how this works so you've got an image from a wedding I shot it's not the best image but it shows well the problem we had on this double-decker bus there this beautiful Routemaster bus but it had this horrible very greeny yellow fluorescent ceiling that was bouncing off onto everyone's skin and giving them a horrible greeny yellow tone on their skin so a good way to fix this is to and add a curves layer and that's before we got to make sure we select the curves not masks I'm gonna double click this mid-tone eyedropper so I can pick an area of skin tone one important thing to mention here is that you must make sure the sample size isn't just a point sample 5 by 5 or 11 by 11 average is good because that takes an average of a group of pixels so I'm going to click here and here we have our skin tone taken from here so now what you wanna do is edit this color to a better skin tone and this is tip number 6 and this is using Photoshop as a calculator so if you read around a lot about skin retouching and getting the perfect skin tone a kind of rough rule of thumb is that the magenta should be twice what the cyan is and the yellow should be two and a half times what the Scion is and that's not what we've got here so the cyan is probably a little much because of all this green so I'm going to just take that down to maybe down to maybe 14 so this is the maths bit so we want magenta to be twice 14 so angrily 14 times 2 and it's gonna give me 14 times 2 and the yellow we want to be 2 and a half times the cyan so we're going to be 14 times 2.5 and that's going to give me 14 times 2.5 and so this is our new improved skin tone so don't want to say this as a z4 I'm gonna click no tiny doing this once and we're gonna click back in the same area and that has changed our skin tones a little bit magenta reso I'm gonna click back in here and I'm going to take the magenta just down by a little bit that's taking just a little bit a magenta out the skintone - that's where we were and that's what we are now and that is a much better skin tone so this next tip number seven is how to get a much better shadow and highlight feature in Photoshop and for some reason Photoshop doesn't seem to prioritize shadow and highlight very highly not like it does in Lightroom because in Lightroom it's right there in the first box it's right there with your exposure in your contrast and everything and it's generally something people change quite a lot and if Photoshop is hidden away in the image menu and in adjustments there's not even any shortcut key for anything so anyway here is an image I took a wedding it's a bride and a groom I took them out at the beach as the Sun was just about to set and they are dramatically underexposed here and then all the detail in the sky is quite bright so if we bring up the exposure we're gonna lose detail in the sky and if we bring it down to get the detail in the sky we're gonna lose them so you would normally go to your shadows and highlights so we go to image adjustments and shadows and highlights and brings up this little dialogue here a shadow slider and a highlight slider but if I do that it looks absolute rubbish it looks like one of those horrible HDR things so what you do here is click show more options and then you are presented with all these other options and the key one here is radius now tone affects how much of the image it classes as shadows and how much of the tone it glosses highlights the amount is how much it raises it by and the radius is the feathering around each pixel by which it will apply the effect so if you want to soften that effect down a little bit just pull out the radius and then we can recover the shadows and the highlights without it going to that horrible HDR look and we have a much better much more natural looking image but of course there's another way to do this and this is tip number eight a lot of you will know this but some of you might not and this is the select subject option so to get this option you need to go to your magic wand tool or your quick selection tool and when you do that you'll notice this select subject button appeared select that and it's given us a marquee around what it thinks to the subject and there's a little bit missing here so we just fill that in and we've got a selection of our subjects and eight or nine times out of ten that will work pretty well so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go to a curves layer and because I had a selection it's automatically made that a mask I'm gonna bring them up in exposure wise and to avoid any sort of rough edges I'm just gonna feather that mask by a good bit there and that's a nice quick simple way just to raise the exposure on your subjects a little bit so this next tip number nine is for files like this where you have a very large file with lots and lots of layers in so if I open this up normally takes a little while because got to think about it and it's got loads and loads of layers I mean I've got pretty fast computer so that opened relatively fast but if you've got a slower computer this is what you can do if you just want to open it without all the layers and you just want to have a flattened image you hold shift and option or alt and shift on the PC click open and you get this dialog box asking if you want to read the composite data instead you click OK and it quickly just opens just a flattened version of that image so I've read open the layered version of this this is tip number 10 using blend modes with adjustment layers so I've got this image here but I'd like a little bit more contrast in it so I'm gonna add a new curves layer gonna put a point here and I'm gonna crush the black slightly and just lift up those light slightly but with this contrast curve whilst adding contrast to darks and lights it's also increased the saturation and I don't want that I would like to get the saturation from this version of the image but with this extra contrast so what I do here I guess my blending modes Aust on the curves layer I go to luminosity and what that does is it only applies the darks and lights and leaves the colors alone I can just pull that back a little bit I think that's a little bit much there we go it's got a little bit of punch there but the colors have remained as saturated as I want them so number 11 nice simple one and this is good for when you finish doing a massive big document like this and you want to just save it as a layered version in case you need to come back and change something so from when you finish you've got all these layers that you didn't end up using some of them are hidden away and loads of folders and the document is much bigger than it needs to be cuz it's got all these unused layers rather than going through one by one and finding where they are take a layer delete hidden layers and that will just delete all the layers that you're not using and then you can save a streamlined version of your layered Photoshop file so tip number 12 is another one for a big layered file like this if you hold shift option command e or shift ctrl alt T on a PC what happens is it creates a new layer at the top of your document that's a flattened version of all the visible layers below it so tip number 13 if I wanted to maybe just take his head here and just copy that to a new document as a flattened version I don't need to flatten anything I just need to go to edit and copy merge and if I create a new document and paste there there we have a flattened version of that selection so number 14 is a very useful one and this is perspective warp so say I've got an image of these films here and I've got another film that I want to place with it but I've taken it the wrong angle for this you go to edit perspective warp all I'm gonna do first is I'm just gonna draw a box here and I'm gonna move these pins just to the edges of one of the sides here and then I'm gonna do the same over here and if you notice these have gone great that will snap we're gonna put that there just move this in slightly and we're gonna do another one from up here I can move this down to here that's gonna snap there and then that's going to snap there so what we do now is we change this from layout to warp and now we can warp our box here I'm pretty happy with that so I'm going to click the tick here and it's going to just apply that there put this down here just get out of shadow we've gone from that to that this doesn't just have to be done on objects it can be done on scenes as well edit perspective warp gotta go from the corner here I'm just gonna lift that up well you want to be wary all these that these lines here are running parallel to whatever's on the image so you can kind of see there that's that's about right you know from this corner and I should snap and then go down to about there so I mean I'm gonna click the warp button again and if you hold shift and click the intersecting lines then you can move two points together and it will straighten the lines this is obviously quite an extreme example but you can do this a lot more subtle ways just to match up perspectives on an image you've taken just tweak things slightly it's a very useful feature so on the subjective perspective tip number 15 is the vanishing point feature so here if we have a building like this and we want to maybe a clone stamp it up or you can do it on a pavement or a row of buildings or anything that has any poor perspective in it go to filter and vanishing point and now this dialog box opens the grid tool is automatically selected so I'm going to draw a grid to match the perspective of the building now that I've drawn that I can grab these side points here and extend them out and Photoshop will extend the grid but it it'll extend it proportionally to the perspective plane of the building and now I'm going to select this tool which is the clone stamp now if an alt or option click here you can see as I'm moving the cursor around the preview is adjusting the perspective to the perspective of the building so I can clone in more building like this and you can choose whether it's a regular clown stamp or a healing brush etc and this is a very useful feature for extending buildings or roads or any flat plains that have a perspective in them so this is tip number 16 and it's an easier way to use the drop shadow so what I've got here is I've got a gradient and I've just typed the word YouTube if I double click the layer or bring up the drop shadow dialog box and rather than going around with your angle and messing around with all these controls here you can just go straight to the document and drag it around it's a little bit easier to position it but the drop shadow is very limited and tip number 17 is how to use it on a 3d plane so let me show you so now I've created that drop shadow I'm gonna right-click it and go to create layer and what's this done is its created its own layer that is just a drop shadow on its own so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna command T or ctrl T to free transform this so I'm just holding command or control on a PC I'm just moving these handles to get a bit of a perspective look to this and then we have our 3d drop shadow because of course once you create a layer you can do whatever you want to it you can change the blur with the field blur you can stretch it warp it do whatever of course the major downside to this is it's a much more destructive way of doing it you can always create a smart object once you've created the layer so you can always reset all your your transformations but the drop shadow itself is kind of locked in but it gives you a lot more scope to create different effects with the drop shadow so tip number 18 is displacement maps and this is useful for something like this where you've got a t-shirt and it's got wrinkles and creases and you want to maybe put a YouTube logo on it so one of the many things you may do is reduce the saturation of that logo slightly they may want to add a multiply layer to it but when you zoom in it's not moving with decreases is just flat on so this is where we use a displacement map so I've created a displacement map for this t-shirt image it's very simple it's basically just a black and white image as a PSD so this is it here this is our displacement map so I'm going to do here so I'm going to select the layer I want to apply the displacement map to which is the logo I'm going it to filter and distort and displace so first of all it's going to ask me how much you want to displace it by 10 pixels is the default so gonna try that and then it's gonna ask me for my displacement map and this is it here so watch this anything that's black in the displacement map won't move in anything that's white will move by 10 pixels as I asked it to and anything that's in between will move by that relative amount so that's quite a lot of movement there so if I'm gonna double click this and maybe go down to 6 6 pixels see what that does displacement map this t-shirt there we go there we go that's probably better I was just picking out the texture there just a little bit and it's just going up on that crease there and it looks much more realistic than that so tip number 19 is the content aware scale so here I've got a picture of a wall and the picture of frame and a picture of the word content aware scale now I want to fit this frame around that word to make it look like the word is framed so if I were to just free transform it like normal what would happen is it would look like that which is obviously stretched and it just doesn't look very good at all so instead of command or control T to get you to a free transform what I'm going to do is I'm going to a content aware scale and that a shift option command and C or shift alt ctrl + C on a PC now watch the difference now if I pull this out the proportions of this frame are being maintained because Photoshop is using some algorithms to work out what it thinks is important detail that shouldn't be stretched and what it thinks it can stretch without being detrimental to the image and it's doing a pretty good job here with this frame so tip number 20 and this is targeting specific tones on a tone curve by clicking the image and this is how you do it so I've got this image here and I'm gonna turn it black and white and I've added a contrast curve I'm gonna click this little hand tool the target adjustment tool I'm going to slide down maybe that bit there but then I'm gonna want maybe this skin tone to be a bit lighter and maybe this is a bit bright and I want like to come down you see every time I'm clicking there's a point added to the graph so obviously the more you do it the more complex is gonna get and the more difficult is going to get but we're adding contrast here we can be specific about how we want that contrast to look but this is a very good way of targeting specific tones in your images and making sure that they are light and darkened exactly how you want them and then you end up with a complex kind of tone curve like this that you probably wouldn't have drawn if you were just trying to place the points yourself and this also can be done on a black and white adjustment layer like this I can target specific colors and doing this with the black and white panel is especially useful when you're working in black and white because you may not remember what all the colors of everything are so you may not remember what color that jumper was or what color that book is behind her but with the target adjustment tool you don't need to worry about that you simply just click it and drag and you can see the adjustments in real time so she's tip number 21 and this is how to make selections with calculations okay so calculations are a little complex but I'll try and explain it as clearly as I can it basically is a feature that uses the channels in order to help make selections and cut out complex elements for example this image here has a lot of complex edges where the trees meet the sky and if we go to our channels we have red green and a blue channel so the red doesn't show much contrast the green shows a little bit more contrast but the blue Channel this shows a lot of contrast this means that we can use that information in this blue channel to help make an accurate mask to cut around all the trees so we access calculations by going image and then calculations and this dialog box will open and basically what you have is you have two channels that are mixed together with a blending mode that you choose and then you can tell it whether you want to output it to a new channel or a selection or a new document I'm going to change this to selection so I can make a mask out of it so imagine source 2 as the bottom layer and imagine the source 1 as the top layer and then the blending mode is applied to that top layer so because we know the blue channel has the most contrast I'm getting put blue over blue so the 3 blending modes you're probably going to use most or multiply and add and subtract now what we want here is we want the sky to be dark and the trees to be light so we're gonna invert both of these channels so there we go that's basically just made a negative of that image but when you invert one channel over another channel you can get some quite interesting and clever selections with this now multiply as a blend mode isn't quite doing enough here so I'm gonna go to add to see what that does now that has given us almost a nice solid white here by a few areas but it's made the sky lot lighter so I'm gonna fiddle around with the offset and the offset is basically where the base point of your darks and lights come from so if I increase the number the image will get lighter if I make it a hundred the image will get lighter but I can do a negative number minus 100 and the image gets darker but where it was going to complete why you still have more information above that so what we found now is that we're getting a very good contrast between these edges here and that's kind of exactly what we want there's minus 100 so I'm going to click OK and then I'm going to click the mask tool now I'm going to option or alt-click the mask and now we can edit the mask first of all I'm just gonna pick the lasso tool and I'm just going to draw very roughly around just to get darks and lights in the areas we need them because I've got black as my foreground color I can click option delete or Alt Delete and that will fill that area with that color so now I'm going to select some of the whites with the lasso tool and I'm just going to go around like this and to reverse this I'm just gonna press X and then optional Alt Delete again just to make that white so what we need to do now is just tidy up this edge a little bit and make sure we've got a nice contrast so I'm gonna go to my brush tool and this is a clever bit with the white selected I'm going to change the blending mode of the brush to overlay and when I draw on here now it's just gonna raise some of those lights but it's not gonna touch the darks if I switch it around to black I draw on here anything that is under 50% brightness will go down to black and anything that is over it won't touch so now we have a nice mask there so now I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this layer by command J or ctrl J on a PC I'm gonna select that mask on the bottom layer I'm gonna right-click it and delete that layer mask so now we can do things like select this dinosaur and paste it in here and we can have a dinosaur emerging above our trees or we could grab another sky image we can paste that sky in and then we'll now have got a different sky behind there anyway that's a very useful feature it's a very powerful one and it's a little bit complicated but it's worth checking out this is tip number 22 and this is how to smooth out a background so I took this portrait here and I was using a pop-up background but it's got a few creases in it you can kind of see I'll add a curves layer here just so you can see that texture in it a bit more so a nice quick easy way I found off fixing this is to click on your magic wand tool or do a direct selection and go select subject now I want to expand selection a little bit maybe by 50 pixels that depend depend on what your image is now I'm going to invert that selection and I'm going to command or control J to make a new layer and then I'm going to command or control click that layer to make a selection of that layer I'm gonna make a mask of that layer and I'm gonna unlink those right you with me okay then what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna click this I'm gonna blur it this is the reason we unlinked them because if I blur it while they're links the mask will blur as well so I'm gonna add a Gaussian blur until all that detail has gone I think around there what's happened there we've got our mask kind of protecting our subject we can always feather that slightly if it looks it's looking a bit harsh and we've got a layer kind of the smooth that's kind of blurring back into the texture just around the edge but because it's only a tiny bit you don't really notice it and then we've got our subject there so I can now apply that texture and we've got a smooth background so here's tip number 23 and it's using calculations again but it's a little bit simpler it's more kind of feeling your way through it and this is how to create dramatic black and whites using calculations so this is another image from the same shoot and if I wanted to create a black and white version of this we could just add a black and white layer and maybe tweak the curves a little bit but you know that's limited what we do have is we have our channels here we have different kind of levels of contrast we've got red where the skins very soft and light we've got blue where the skins very textured green somewhere in the middle so we get the image and calculations and then we can change our mode to something like overlay and we can just have a fiddle around the different channels until we find something that's working nicely green Avery his that's quite interesting blue over greens nice and dramatic maybe that's a little bit harsh maybe take it down to 80% opacity and we change the results to a new document so that simply takes that image and makes a new document here but look how brilliantly dramatic that is and it's not over sharpened but you've got so much detail there so because this is an alpha Channel now we're gonna change it to grayscale and I'm gonna change that from grayscale to RGB so we can work with it but that is a very nice interpretation of that I think and that's a nice sort of simple way to get some read rheumatic effects so have a play around with that because that's probably one of my favorite ways of creating black and white images so this next tip is tip number 24 and here's the frame tool so I've got an image here it's 1080 by 1080 is instagram size and I've got some guides up here if I hit K I get to my frame tool this tool here I'm gonna draw a frame here and go draw another one here so as I say this is a PSD I can use this as a template I can just drag in any image I want to into the frame once you've selected the layer you double click to select removing the image within the frame and moving the frame itself that's a nice little way to make templates if you want to do things like Instagram or magazine spreads or anything like that so number 25 it uses the new features that I've just released in the updates to the warp tool this is 2019 is November at the moment so it's that recent update if you're watching this at another time but this is how to protect an area when you are warping an image so we have this image of a woman sat on a rock here and we've got a loaded text here that we're going to put as an article on why she likes to sit on rocks and the problem is is that she's not ideally placed for this text it's going over her face the text becomes illegible what would be nice if she was done has moved out here so we just need to warp the image a bit so if we were to hit command or control T to get the free transform then click this icon here it will change to the warp tool and you know we could move her over but what happens is she starts to get stretched and it don't look good so what you do is you hold alt or option then you get this little crosshair I'm just going to draw a box around her like that to the floor so it's now split this into six if X X in the middle of this box and I pull this over the proportions of whatever's in that box are being respected and everything around it is getting stretched so I'm happy with that so I'll click the tick and here we go so I just noticed that this channel past quarter of a million subscribers the other day and thank you to everyone who subscribed and to everyone you leave such supportive comments even though I might not have the time to respond to everyone personally I want you to know that I greatly appreciate it and thank you also to my patreon supporters and to anyone who buys my Lightroom presets as this is what primarily funds my channel and allows me to bank the videos that I make I have a massive list of ideas for future videos so watch this space for lots more to it's definitely worth checking out I'll see you next time [Music]
