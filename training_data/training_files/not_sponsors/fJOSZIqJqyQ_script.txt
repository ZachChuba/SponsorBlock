website or online store make it with Squarespace michael crabtree is the best receiver in the country I tell you what he catches the football he runs past people that says this is going to be a shootout for sure still one timeout left here for Texas Tech eight seconds sucker down down deep strike the big man [Applause] the fans have stormed the field they're gonna have to clear the field there [Music] think about this most players are out of their program in five years so to say that college football has changed would be a massive understatement 2008 was a time where Alabama wasn't thought of as a powerhouse yet Missouri seemed like a legitimate title contender USC was still relevant with Pete Carroll as their coach the NCAA football franchise was still alive and well and the dreaded BCS system still existed but now let me take you back to what college football was like a decade ago the hype and college football really boils down to two things a the best teams in the nation and B the best players in the nation let's look more into the second part of that statement back then if you were like me you'd hop onto your computer which probably ran Windows XP and you'd head over to ESPN's website there was a popular voting poll made every year by college game days analyst Kirk Herbstreit it was called the Herbie Awards who's the best veteran running back James Davis LeSean McCoy from Pitt Knowshon Moreno was a total beast tomorrow Murray was great and Javan ringer was the man before Le'Veon Bell at Michigan State and lastly my man beanie wells [Applause] who's the best wide receiver there was a bunch of good ones but come on Michael Crabtree was a showstopper best pocket passer the two names he probably recognized our Sam Bradford and masse Stafford but don't forget about Curtis Painter he served the honorary role as the suck for luck quarterback in Indianapolis for one year best mobile quarterback chase Daniel was good and he was supposed to leave Mizzou to a national title and then there was Pat white who was the most electric quarterback in college football but most people probably would have voted for Tim Tebow let's look at some of the top story lines going into the 2008 season number one another BCS crown for the SEC it seemed inevitable that at least one of the SEC teams were going to appear in the national title the year before it was LSU in the year before that was Florida number two Kim Tebow match Archie Griffin Archie Griffin is the only player to ever win the Heisman Trophy twice Tebow was only a junior and he already had one plus this team was looking much better than the year before many people felt like this was a possibility number three the Buckeyes hope three is a charm Ohio State had gone to back-to-back national titles and lost they did return most with our starters and many people felt like they could make a run with a huge game early versus number one USC they were about to find out really quickly what they were made of number four whose the bcs Buster this was a common theme over the last few years which of the non BCS schools would sneak into a BCS bowl game many people like BYU led by quarterback max Hall but this wasn't the only team that had a real shot I'd go into a BCS pool number 5 can Michigan turn it around they were supposed to be one of the powerhouses of college football the year before but after being completely embarrassed by Appalachian State and firing their head coach Lloyd Carr Rich Rodriguez was going to try to turn this program around number six the big 12 power struggle there were so many good teams in the big 12 in 2008 it's pretty insane to look back on both divisions offered a host of potential title contenders and the only thing that really anyone knew was that it wasn't going to be easy to make it out of the big 12 South alive after three years on the sidelines the Mark Sanchez era begins here at USC steps away this second touchdown [Applause] [Music] [Applause] never seen any player in the entire country plays hard as I will play the rest of the season and you never see someone push the rest of team as hard as I will push everybody the rest of the season you never see a team play harder and we will the rest of this season god bless they're gonna be a top five club I think they'll be three you know that'll be in the top five out of the big 12 with Oklahoma leave the country at number one throws for incomplete Texas football two and a half minutes to go bouncing Texas wins from the 28th the throw goes to the right side for Crabtree it's three is better [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they can Tibo back TiVo it's caught touchdown Riley Cooper with the conclusion of the port Alabama game this wrapped up the first portion of the year with the complete dominance the big Club offensively we saw the top five feature all but one player from the conference with that other dude being Tim Tebow this ended up being one of the narrowest margins of victory in a while the best part was that Sam Bradford was going to be facing off against Tim Tebow in the national championship going back to the storylines before the season number six Oklahoma won the big 12 South by some controversy to be clear it was close enough to go all the way out to the fifth tiebreaker but I don't want to get too much in depth into this because this year in the big 12 deserves an entire video on its own number 5 can Michigan turn it around not even close number four this year is representative of all the small schools belong to Utah and it was by the help of the BCS computers because Boise State went undefeated as well but even though Utah with 12 and oh they weren't getting any respect going into the Sugar Bowl versus Alabama how does Utah handle a very big very physical and pretty fast Alabama team can the Utah hold up against those big Alabama front lines number three the transition of terrelle pryor had some growing pains but they did finish the regular season 10 and 2 then they lost the Colt McCoy in Texas in the Fiesta Bowl number 2 Tim Tebow finished third in the Heisman race but he did have the most first-place foes to be honest this didn't matter as much to Tim Tebow number one out of the SEC the Tim Tebow led Gators were on a sensational run after losing early in the season they were stabbed and ready but Sam Bradford was going to be tough to stop after throwing 50 touchdowns to only eight interceptions the only question that remained who was going to get it done on the biggest stage [Applause] [Music] still looking close and a touchdown erisa ball loose it is a touchdown fake it to Chaney Bradford to the end Bradford not looking at wood it's bad [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] video I'll see you guys next time [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
