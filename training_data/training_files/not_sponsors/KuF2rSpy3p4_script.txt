hey what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so today I bring you guys loot from 3000 Abbas coolest nights and I want to say that this video was meant to be uploaded sooner but in all honesty I just really did not enjoy this update and to make matters worse after killing 2000 of these nights there was a second update where they did increase the HP and at the difficulty of killing them so that kind of made this video a little bit longer than it should have been so I do apologize for that just got to get those quick excuses in there you know but with all that being said let's go ahead and get into today's video so the original boss colas came into the game January 26 2005 and fast forward 14 years here we are with the new and improved boss last night and I will say that you know they do kind of look like the original one but they also kind of look like a dark beast as well as a Drake kinda combined into one in my opinion so the graphics on this thing definitely do stand out now these Knights are located in the Jormungand prison beneath the island of stone and of course you do need a sixty Slayer in order to kill them with the completion of the quest the Fremen ik exiles just like the other boss Gliss you do have to equip a mirror shield or preferably the shield that I was using which is the V shield now the shield is definitely required because if you don't have it on then you will get your stats reduced and it's just kind of one of those things that is necessary to always have here and it is important to note that all of this was done for me off tasks and the rare drop that these boss killers have to offer the jaw is 5 times rarer off task so unfortunately I was kind of going into this video knowing that the odds of me getting that jaw would be extremely rare however I just did not have the Slayer points that I needed in order to consistently get assigned this task and be 5 times more likely to get that rare so while this video might not be the luckiest in terms of drops at least you guys are going to get a pretty good idea of how to kill these Knights and why you should kill them if you should at all and of course their normal drop table and all of the untradable drops that go along with that so these Knights have two different attack styles one of them being and the other one being Mele and you will always see people praying magic here because that is their main attack style that hits the highest that the max hit being 40 so you got to be careful and make sure that you're always praying may cheer as it goes for your inventory and your choice of gear you know that's up to you there are a lot of people that do safespot these with range inside I personally went with the max strength setup firstly using a whip and a Nessie a little bit of varrock sand then I switched over to a rapier and full Bandos with a serpentine elm only I do regret now using a serpentine helmet because if I would have used the fighter hat the whole time I think I would have had a better stab bonus I probably would have had faster kills so yeah your gear choice is really just all about your budget but it is important to always bring food and always make sure to bring prayer potions here for me for the first 2000 kills I was bringing 4 super restores and one super combat and pretty much just the whole rest of my inventory was filled with anglerfish with of course the exception of the bottom row being my teleport to the bank teleport back the gem bag and of course the bone crusher which is one of two ways that I did track all of the kills for this video and the bone crusher was a nice addition because I did get a free 45 K prayer XP from doing this and if you are maxed or if you are someone who has the Diaries done always make sure to bring a bone crusher and something that I didn't start bringing until the very end of the video was a dragon war hammer and that is the best in slot special attack weapon for this monster a hundred percent the reason for that is because these things like I mentioned many times before is such hide defend such high HP and the dragon Warhammer special attack really helps lower the defense and just speed up the kill and I honestly think if I would have brought a dragon Warhammer every single inventory from start to finish I really think I would have shut off probably like three hours off this video just because of how effective that Warhammer spec really is so if you can't afford it I believe it's only like 37 ish mil right now very cheap just like a lot of other items in game would recommend investing in it because of course you can't bring a saradomin god sword here or anything like that well you could bring a saradomin god sword here you could also bring a scythe any two-handed weapon you can bring but again if you do get attacked by that one specific hit and you do not have that shield equipped on you will have all of your stats reduced so that is something to keep in mind it is a risk to bring a special attack weapon that isn't a dragon war hammer but like I said it's all about your budget and all about your prep and speaking of preference you know if you don't like this room in order to kill these Knights there is another room to the east of this one and I did use that room for a very short period of time which you will see a little bit in this video but for the most part you will find more nights to the West all the way south in this room and I will say since this update provided a new best in slot helmet this was very crowded on release and for the very first 4 days it was just hard to find any world let alone any total level world to find these nights to be available there's always multiple people in one spot and I was very hard to find kills but it quickly died down after those days went by and I really wasn't having that problem anymore so that was good now one downside of these nights is that you can't use a cannon down here unfortunately you can only use a cannon down here in the Dagon ethroo and not the boss classroom so that is a downside but one upside to this monster is that they are very afk to kill and even after jagex did buff them and make them a little bit stronger than they were before providing them with an extra attack that kind of freezes your character for 1 or 2 seconds even after all of that I was finding myself almost never dying and pretty much never having to click you know I mean the kills would take so long I would never have to move throughout the whole kill start to finish yeah I really didn't require that much clicking so that was one upside was that I was on my ironman from start to finish all of the 50 hours that this video did take me to do i got a lot done on multiple accounts so that was a good thing i mean that's kind of one bonus about this monster is that you can really just kind of zone out as long as you keep your HP and your prayer up and you don't die of course you can pretty much do whatever you want right so moving on from all of that let's talk a little bit about the drop table of these boss coolest nights and just how good or how bad it is now you can't tell throughout the video I was getting in the occasional hard clue scroll and I did end up doing just about 11 hard clues through 3000 nights I'm not too sure of the drop rate of the clue Scrolls but it was a nice transition you know going from killing the nights consistently to taking a little bit of a break and getting that clue scroll with the potential for some extra profit so you will see all of those open caskets towards the end of the video as usual and as I mentioned before you know these boss coolest nights only really have that one rare drop which is considered to be the which is what you put on a Nessie helmet to make it the new best in slot face card helmet and while I do find it weird that they decided to put that drop on a level 60 Slayer monster I still can't understand that especially the difficulty of this monster with the level it just really doesn't add up to me but nevertheless you know that is what makes this monster pretty profitable now if you happen to be unlucky and you don't receive the jaw then the second best tradable rare that you can get from these boss coolest Knights is a golden mystic hat and it is currently valued at just under 10k and at this point in the video I was nearing at 2500 kills overall and that was pretty much all I was seeing was white mystic hats and of course the occasional long bone the occasional boss callous head and you know nearing 3000 I was not too sure if I was going to get that jaw drop or not I really wanted to see my jaw drop over the jaw drop but did not unfortunately happen we did get to that 3,000 points and unfortunately all I saw towards the very end of the video was another head with no jaw to go along with it so there you go 3,000 boss coolest Knights have been completed I'm not gonna lie I am pretty disappointed that I did not get the jaw drop but since I was not on task at all throughout this video I completely understand and I am curious as to see just how rare it is and I'm sure I will update the description just as soon as I get the exact number for the drop rate of it on an off task but for now we are left with all of the normal drops all of the Alex the runes the herbs and the gems as well as all of the clues scrolled caskets just to confirm all the 3000 Bonecrusher charges were used and as you can see there in at the slayer helm log of 3,000 Knights have been killed pretty ironic timing there with the global announcement there but anyway I will say it was a fun experience I mean it was kind of boring at times not gonna lie you know the afk and just kind of sitting there but you know I did have my iron man foursome side entertainment and again the clue Scrolls always kind of gave me a break from the grind itself so that was nice something I do want to say though is that I did bank probably 25 times more than the average player would if you're going to be killing these bossless Knights most of the time you are going to be bringing high I myself had to Bank all of the individual rune items that you see in those tabs as well as all of the ADI items so I was banking a hell of a lot more than the average player would so this did take me a little bit longer because of that but with all that being said let's go ahead and get into the price check as we can see right away we already have 629 K that is just from the coin drop so those do add up to be a little bit you know overtime 3000 that's not a terrible amount from that and if you are curious as to how much we made from all of those clues curls we did walk away with just about 1.1 millets go ahead and price check all of these drops all of the rune all of the runes the herbs the gems as well as the GP everything does come out to be just about thirteen point six mil from 3,000 bas coolest nights now of course we have to add in the infamous golden mystic hats as well as the long bones and let's not forget the heads ten long bones six heads and seven hats that is the overall highlight of the video I guess unfortunately I didn't really make too much profit I mean that thirteen point six mil seems like a decent amount but for the fifty hours that it took to do as well as all the divine super combat potions all the prayer potions I mean I think I really only profited probably somewhere around three to four mil had we gotten the JA than I think this would have had a happier ending but nevertheless I hope you guys enjoyed the video on the upside I did get a lot of strength xp got a lot of long bones so that's free construction XP and yeah I mean I learned a lot about new monsters so I mean it was overall a decent experience hope you guys enjoyed I'm currently working on 10,000 a Burin spectres on my ironman that's halfway done and alongside that i'm also working on a loot video on mr. no sleep i think it's going to be loot from 100 chambers of Zarek's kind of do that as a test run and if people seem to like it I might commit to a thousand but we will see I got a lot of things on my mind right now you guys also might see a different style video on this channel very soon something that I don't think anyone will ever expect I'm kind of excited for it I'm not too sure how it's gonna go but that's also in the works and you will see that later this month as well has nothing to do with any monsters this time so I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys will think about that and I'm going to stop extending this now I just had to get that last word in a lot of things are to come thank you guys very much for watching and I will see you next time and until then mr. no sleep out
