since the early days of this channel i have advocated for more frequent reprints of magic the gathering cards i've done so because i believe that expensive hard to get game pieces hinder access to the game for players new and even old and that as magic is a game first everyone should have reasonable access to building a deck and sitting down to play at their local game store but magic is not just a game in isolation it is also a collectible card game and while i don't like the idea of key game pieces being worth hundreds of dollars apiece i do also enjoy collecting cards and i certainly enjoy those cards having value it's the ultimate contradiction isn't it i want cards to be worth something certainly the cost of a pack i am buying but not too much not so much that people get priced out of the game well presented here are five cards that i hope will never ever be reprinted but not for the reasons you might think when i say that there are cards that i hope never get reprinted i don't mean cards that are too powerful or perhaps too agonizing to play against nor do i mean reserve list cards which i have already been quite adamant about wanting to be reprinted yes indeed very much so no the idea of cards i never want reprinted came from browsing the enormous selection of possibilities on the list and seeing this a reprint of the player's reward printing of negate and disenchant for those unaware wizards of the coast once sent cards to players in exchange for regular participation in events at their local game store these player rewards cards were distinct with no text and a cool frame treatment i loved them here check it out ah cryptic command was particularly infamous because the already intense possibility of modes on it are made all the more cryptic when it is printed completely textless but that's not why i was disappointed to see player rewards cards on the list in fact my collection of player rewards cards are some of my most prized they're special they're different and yeah the cryptic command was illustrated by the same artist who did the original cryptic command art only here wayne england has stunningly drawn a mystical merfolk hand holding the elusive command there's so many little gems here i just love everything about them and yes part of that love comes from the uniqueness of each card's art this weird ephemeral offering that came and went and likely will never return again not just player rewards but specifically textless promos that wild circular frame it's all a relic of a bygone era and while all of these cards ranging from lightning bolt to negate to cryptic command have thankfully thankfully been reprinted several times keeping their prices in check these variations of the cards are one of a kind or at least they were until the list i want so badly for player rewards or something like it to return to magic someday but not necessarily for reprints of player reward card art in fact i think that having a heavy reprint policy but also having a highly selective artwork reprint policy goes well together in the example of negate it can be a 20 cent card and a 10 card this is super healthy for the game as it ensures certain artworks or treatments of cards have a high value but that their game pieces are cheap and accessible if wizards of the coast declared that they would never reprint the artwork used in player rewards cards again it wouldn't matter how expensive that full art negate got because there'd always be 20 cent copies mind you i do not think this should be true for all artworks or even most only some a select few i loved time spiral remastered what i could get of it anyway and the fact that they used the original artwork in that sets reprints what i am talking about here are the special artworks on special cards that maybe should be kept special by never reprinting and so here are my top five cards i think should never be reprinted using player rewards as my honorary mention since they already have been reprinted on the list or at least some of them will but coming in at number five i will say let's talk about friday night magic promos game day promos and gp promos if you've watched my channel for any time at all you'll know that i think the gathering is the best part of magic at events like gps which hopefully will someday return game day which hopefully will someday return and friday night magic which is it's starting to return you often got special printings of cards featuring unique artworks and or frames grand prix promos evolved over time and the last few we got were a full art lightning bolts and path to exiles which honestly are some of the most gorgeous printings of each card that has ever been game day was possibly my favorite overall event ever held and the way it worked was that you got a full art non-foil uncommon from the new set just for showing up and playing in the event so everyone walked away with something special and beautiful and in a style unique to that event but if you made top 8 you would also get a foil full art rare from the new set and if you won you got a special champio playmat these events were so great at driving traffic to local game stores energizing the community encouraging everyone to build standard decks right ahead of the new season starting they were just great friday night magic really took a turn when they tried to eliminate promos entirely and replaced them with foil tokens one of my more ahem infamous videos was sounding the alarm on this and within a few short months attendance numbers and feedback overwhelmingly convinced wizards of the coast that i was right and friday night magic promos returned but not quite as good as they had been where once friday night magic promos had unique art now they did not where once they could be of any period from magic's history now they were just uncommons tied to the recent standard set so in many ways wizards of the coast managed to get rid of friday night magic promos without really getting rid of them and it's a shame because the history of these promos has some really cool cards that again helped encourage attendance at events and at the local games store now as i have also covered no one knows what's going on another oddball series of artworks that i hope they don't reprint are the champ series of cards this is a style i do hope they revisit as you can see it's somewhere close to the game day full art with text but these champ series cards have ended up for the most part being some pretty valuable collector's items and as much as i would love to bling out my various merfolk decks with those outrageously expensive mutavault full arts i have instead enjoyed doing things like hey blinging them out with the foiled gp promos of mutavault featuring celebrated artist john avon you see we can continue to make exciting and accessible reprints of guards without reusing special event art that's kind of my thesis literally as i make this video wizards of the coast announced a secret lair featuring phyrexian language praetors including a reprint of the rare and coveted elishnorn phyrexian language judge promo i swear to you this video was pretty much already done when this news hit because judge foils legitimately were a type of card art that i included as something that i don't think should be reprinted judge foils for those who don't know are a thank you to the hard-working judge community judges literally go to events and choose not to play magic so that the rest of us can and i've always greatly respected that the judge foils have been a sign of respect to the judges and reprinting them to just directly sell as singles seems disrespectful of that i know it is a coveted treatment but i feel we can reprint ellis norn to make her affordable without needing to reprint a special offering of her that was given as a gift just to judges i mean just do the secret layer but use different elishnorn art perhaps that's enough that's all it needs to be that then makes the ellis norn you get in that secret lair special and it also keeps the judge one special what's ironic is that secret layers though i am not personally a fan of them were also an item i felt should retain the uniqueness of its art offerings and wizards of the coast has all but said that secret lair art will not be reprinted and will not be reused elsewhere so to take judge foils which should not be reused and then reuse them in a secret layer which is a product you promised your customers will not have its art reused well there's a weird combination of hypocrisy and trust issues there so what are the top two types of cards that i think should keep their artwork and unique styles from being reprinted [Music] coming in at number two are the special showcase styles of cards that have been included in standard sets in recent years you may be getting used to them but as an elderly magic player they still feel very new to me and i love them in fact i think wizards of the coast should make each set in both regular and showcase styles and that 100 of the cards in a collector booster should be showcases and that you could literally collect a showcase of every single car that's another video from throne of el drain to caldheim to aquoria to the stunning mystic archives from strixaven these are collectors pieces in the making and what great incentive to collect and play the game and yeah crack packs don't do that by singles but you know you're gonna do it then knowing that these artworks may never come again i would also extend this to include the alternate japanese treatments that planeswalkers got in war of the spark and mystic archives got and stricthaven doing more in this style is a cool idea adding cards doing more mystic archives of new cards i'm all for that and i'd love to see an anime style planeswalker for every planeswalker ever printed at some point but that special liliana let's leave her the stuff of legend i think that's good for the game too along those same lines my number one card style and art i hope never gets reprinted are the masterpieces and expeditions that showcases seem to have replaced i really missed these they botched them in almond cats sure but i really wish they had not thrown the baby out with the bathwater one thing i've been painstakingly collecting are the gorgeous kaladesh inventions and zendikar expeditions and while i would have both preferred to see masterpieces continue in every set and also be improved upon i would hate to see a secret layer just offering sets of five of the existing almond cap invocations reprinted for 39.99 these were wild chase cards unique frames and styles again i wouldn't mind seeing the frames and style used for new cards new amonkhet style inventions but as much as i want fetchlands reprinted and thankfully they are reprinting fetchlands i think using new art styles or the same art but with a new border or frame style as they are doing in modern horizons an exciting combination of both is the way to go reprint the card always keep cards affordable but let some very rare very special card arts and styles stay that way and to be clear this isn't a big deal it's just some thoughts i have had many of the cards i talked about here have already been reprinted in various areas like the list and the world by no means has come to an end but when i think of the reserve list i'd so much rather have cards like tropical island and mox emerald reprinted with new art in exchange for just agreeing to never use the original art in a reprint reprint the game piece make the game pieces affordable and then make some not all but a very rare sum of arts collectible but now i want to hear from you do you agree that certain artworks like promos and secret layers and masterpieces should never be used again or am i proposing something really stupid here let me know in the comments below is this just like another reserve list i'm talking about i don't want that or just tell me what awesome audiobook you'll choose for free when you use my code to sign up for audible start listening with a free 30-day audible
