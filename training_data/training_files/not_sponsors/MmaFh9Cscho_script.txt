to know the particulars of how i do what i do take a look at the book titled how to be a detective it's real helpful especially if you're new to the mystery solving business and be sure to check out my screen i put memorabilia from all my past cases in there a lot of them were pretty dangerous and at times really scary but don't say anything about that to my dad okay he worries about me enough as it is and whatever you do read what's in the file called case file that'll tell you all about the mystery i'm about to try to solve if you think you're ready to dive into that mystery just click on the plane ticket and you'll be on your way thanks nance all right that goes there this goes here hello chat all right all right what's new as always your mission is to solve the mystery by stepping into my shoes [Music] in this game you'll be able to sneak phone mode stores all the numbers you'll need to know bring up the correct contact or dial the number yourself to get from one place to another in the game just move your cursor around on the screen the headmistress at the waverly academy for girls has asked me begged me actually to discover who's been leaving mysterious notes for students there and causing these strange accidents that always follow them so malicious was the last accident the parents of its victim are threatening to sue the school if the perpetrator isn't identified fast and so pretending to be a transfer student named becca sawyer i'm going to go undercover i'm going undercover and hopefully find the culprit i have to use a fake name instead of my real one because of any of my soon-to-be classmates plug the name nancy drew into an online search engine my cover would be blown in an instant and to make sure no one sees or hears anything that could give me away the headmistress has forbidden me to contact her which means i'm about to be tossed totally on my own into a world of bright privileged click-conscious teenage girls this could be my scariest case yet that sounds hilarious uh i'm excited for that have we gone undercover before i think everyone has always like known that i'm that i'm nancy drew right dude time sandwich thank you for gifting 10 subs what a hamburger oh wait no time sandwich subscribed it was frisky dingus 89 the gifted tim's 10 subs dude you need to do that thanks so much frisky dingus what a hamburger okay

one have i been been doing have i everyone is telling me to do junior okay i'll just stick with you i'll stick with junior everyone is okay baby mode baby mode what a hamburger let me out hey hmm it could be worse right what a hamburger you're the new person oh she did it is she our roommate i'm karine the person who stuck rooming with you yeah she did it i mean you're the person who's stuck rooming with me yeah anyway welcome to my your our humble dwelling space it's the roommate it's always the roommate she's gonna be like really nice to us and be our friend at the end it's gonna be like you did this didn't you uh thanks sorry to barge in and bug you like this you look really busy busy that's the understatement of the year four days to finish a 30-page research paper that has to be fully annotated utilizing a bibliography that has to include at least six published no online stuff published sources any normal student would hate having you barge in like this but then i'm not all that normal so you can bug me all you want nothing what well you are technically but you're not really because i'm so never mind spoken like a true murderer has anyone been murdered yet spoken like a true murderer uh orient me i told you could help me you know get oriented oh yeah you bet let's see first thing you gotta do is read the waverly student guide which is online if you don't have a laptop it doesn't look like you do that one little bag is all you brought uh all my stuff's being shipped from france it'll be here in a couple of days but please go on anyway you can get online by jumping on the computer in the library just make sure you read the part in the guide about waverly's demerit system really well it's enforced by paige believe me you do not want to mess with her let's see what a hamburger oh yeah this floor is special because only seniors who are viable candidates for valedictorian live up here whoever's named valedictorian gets a full ride scholarship to the university of her choice so what's a pretty big deal of course the only truly viable candidate is me oh and i shall probably tell you about the curse the curse some of the kids on this floor have been getting these like threatening notes from someone calling herself the black cat but the first note's a warning but if you get a second one something really bad happens to you and last week the girl in the room next door megan vargas she got a second note and that night she ate something at dinner she was allergic to and had such a bad reaction that she had to go home somebody's obviously playing a prank but a lot of kids are starting to get really freaked out wait a minute you mean the only girls to get notes from this black cat person are girls who are in the running to be valedictorian i hadn't really thought of it that way but yeah i guess that's right maybe somebody's jealous of a smart kids or something or maybe it's one of us maybe someone's trying to scare off her competition whatever it's not gonna work on me [Music] okay well i mean she definitely did it um i i feel like a trend with me and these nancy drew games is i immediately find someone i think did it and i i won't let that thought go even once i find out who really did it so that's going to be maybe i could maybe i can overcome this in my uh detectiving this time also we got two seconds into our undercover operation before we had to make up oh my stuff is getting shipped here from france it's this is gonna go awful it's gonna go awful um have you ever gotten one of these black cat notes yeah i got one about three days ago no kidding may i see it sorry i took one look at it and tore it up but if you'd like to see the note my ex-roommate got that one's right here she had kind of a bad experience got locked in her black closet overnight see she was claustrophobic so when they found her the next morning she could barely talk and when i came back from class that afternoon she just left no note no call no text nothing just gone when she got this how did she react she tried to laugh it off but i think she was scared she was pretty neurotic what about the second note there wasn't a second note or at least if there was she never said anything about it to me hmm she's a horse girl too see up here just i'm seeing all the signs used a lot of sticky notes can't trust that hmm where's that cello music coming from next door that's mel corbilis [Music] does she ever stop playing depends on her mood when she's really really down i'll bet if they didn't give demerits for making noise after hours she'd play that thing 24 7. well guess i'd better go start meeting people yeah i guess you'd better i'm not so bad right what do you mean it's just that well you're about to find out that i'm not exactly the most never mind you'll see soon enough everybody knows i'm a murderer or a closet locker i guess i don't know no murder yet what are you doing go meet people go don't tell me what to do i wanted to snoop through your desk but do we have like a a we got like a planetary mobile up there [Music] rachel wants me to come to her room rachel hubbard she's in the room at the end of the hall welcome to waverly since you just so small uh the text on my screen since you just got transferred here uh and don't really have any papers due or exams to study uh for unlike the rest of us i could really use your help on this project i'm working on oh my god i'm gonna need some reading practice please come see me as soon as you can my room's at the the other end of the hall thank you so much rachel okay [Music] she's not even very good mr mr mingles says hi how do you say her name corinne corrin oh jesus jump scare your hair's on fire no wonder you're in a hurry my hair's on fire just kidding red hair looks really good on some people i'm missy romero i'm becca sawyer i just transferred here where are you from from the states originally but i came here by way of france it's a long story short let me have your cell phone my cell phone yeah so i can set you up on the local network it'll just take a second okay this way you'll be able to get texted and keep up on all the breaking news there you go look my room's on the other side of the study hall but lately i've been spending most of my time in the library so come talk to me i'm student body president which means when it comes to the lay of the land i got the best map see ya okay so far so good [Music] redheads suck right [Music] let's be friends [Music] help come on in oh well i like her already help something i didn't read oh wait she's the one making all the noise i love the room who are you uh i'm becca sawyer i just moved into the room next door oh yeah you're the transfer the one who got kicked out of some school in france what no i didn't waverly's primary source of all wisdom and truth has been suggesting otherwise hey look i don't really care but you got to admit it's kind of weird to be changing schools in the middle of your senior year and the fewer gory details you provide as to why the more kids are going to talk or should i say text look at her futuristic cell phone it's the age of the cell phone so i'm the source of rumors already welcome to waverly where's your roommate she's the one who was sent home because of an allergic reaction to something she ate after being cursed by the black cat you sound a little skeptical the black cat is just someone playing an idiotic prank end of story of course it's not the end of the story from my roommate megan who wound up having to go home sick with an allergic reaction that almost killed her but it's still a stupid prank she did it it's definitely this girl oh my gosh what exactly happened to her look enough about the black cat the other girls can buy into that garbage all they want but the p brain that's behind this i refuse to give her the satisfaction so if you have questions for megan i think you should call her yourself nine 845-555-1849 that gonna get added to my notebook or my phone should i write that down remember this number guys okay it shouldn't be that hard to remember uh how well do you know the girl i'm rooming with karine kareem probably better than anybody she doesn't have a lot of friends but she's incredibly smart plus she's a social outcast too so we get along pretty well don't care who's smarter what makes you say she's a social outcast she's so desperate for people to like her she gets on everyone's nerves me i don't much care if people like me or not but corrine she cares a lot and it shows you play that cello pretty well thank you i taught myself to play when i was 10. does waverly have an orchestra yeah but as you may have guessed i'm not much of a joiner i'll let you get back to your music sounds good okay i gotta check this room out uh search out followed by more wonder why it was spelled with two o's instead of one is this sampler as old as it looks it's old that's for sure my great great great grandmother made it she was in the first class of students to graduate from here everybody in my family who attends waverly has to hang that thing in a room it's tradition did your mother graduate from here and her mother and her mother's mother ad infinitum i come from a long line of waverly grads and what you call a legacy i was admitted automatically [Music] okay she's always like yelling questions she's like i can't get discovered as a detective but let me yell a series of of very pointed questions at you no one will know oh my god she has a uh what are they called a pop figure she's got her own uh youtubes uh [Music] how do i okay that's it that's it okay help disappearing oh my god disappearing under a mound of laundry can i borrow some detergent okay

blending in perfectly i don't think anyone i'm just gonna go back out okay [Music] five demerits are these like house points are these gonna come back and get me if i get get too many uh demerits i

i don't know anything about web design you don't have to i just need you to do grunt work take pictures and upload them mostly the pages i'm designing will be part of the waverly school website you sure that's not cheating positive it's a design class not a photography class what the pictures are of and where they appear on the page are all that's important and that'll be totally up to me i know this is kind of weird but i'm rachel hubbard i'm from pittsburgh i'm here on a scholarship i blew a recent ap chem test which means i probably won't be valedictorian unless everybody else totally messes up she did it i love dogs i hate cauliflower my favorite subject's math and i am desperate i'm a killer i lock people in closets thank you thank you thank you okay what you need to do first is take a picture of all the valedictorian candidates here are their names you have a camera cell phone right of course of course i got a camera for a cell phone attach a camera to a usb port after

can't play or too bad i'm helping rachel both but mostly too bad you're being subjected to rachel on your very first day oh man everyone just hates each other this is great so far i like rachel i don't know ray why do you say that she's got this bizarre schizoid thing going she'll say something one day then deny it the next or she'll do something then claim she didn't she's actually kind of scary you'll see oh fact it wouldn't surprise me if she's the black cat no it's my roommate cat right that's my room oh yeah i heard see rachel flunked a test a couple weeks ago which means she can't be valedictorian so maybe in some twisted way she thinks we're to blame and she's using this black cat stuff to freak us all out not that it's working on me at least i've won state championships in both soccer and basketball no way am i gonna let a couple of stupid notes get to me um do you ever hang out with my roommate corrine not if i can help it why not she's just a pain she tries so hard to fit in that it turns people off most people at least mel corbilis and her are friends no big surprise after all weirdos of a feather flock together because you're in the running for valedictorian i need to get a close-up of you for the school website if that's okay no problem fire when ready i can't pan i just you okay over there shut up bro bust your face you okay over there i said fire when ready i got it i got it fellow [ __ ] thank you fire when ready for the six dollars and change hello mr moose i recently stumbled upon your mystery science theater cover of the intro song and thought it was amazing i've watched most of your vods but notice you never brought it up and was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about it thanks um that's i could maybe go into more detail on a stream that's not nancy thank you very much fellow [ __ ] i was just contacted uh by a friend to provide vocals for that uh that track i didn't work on it outside of that thank you very much should i get a regular one i said fire when ready i'm waiting uh okay there's two you okay over there i've bugged you enough for now that's all right i'm kind of waiting for my boyfriend to call he goes to oxboro that's the boys school just down the road talking to you helped kill the time i'll see ya can i look at my pictures okay yeah sorry there's really not much more i can say fellow [ __ ] it was just a friend contacted me that was the they're working on that track knew i was a fan that's about it i didn't have any uh like i didn't work on it outside of that i want to play air hockey mmm what a hamburger i want to play darts i wanna snoop can't snoop in any of that [Music] delicious is this the snack will they call it the snack stand oh i can just sure yeah i'll just start picking up these trophies why not sure eight bit kitty cat thank you for the five dollars it's my girlfriend's birthday today and we're both watching the stream so if you could say happy birthday to evie that would be awesome assuming that's evie evie evie happy birthday evie evie happy birthday evie it's probably one of those happy birthday here we go we can play happy birthday [Music] nope [Music] thank you thank you i'm a professional i uh i i actually wrote the happy birthday song i wrote that in my free time just the other day [Music] um i think it'll really catch on i can't leave yet there are still too many strange things going on here well i was just gonna wander um okay oh dang is this the library can i use my cell phone in here bonjour unfortunately that and chihuahua are all the french i know hey my condolences on your roommate assignment you know it might not be too late to get it changed you don't like karine either nobody likes karine why not because she's kareem and karine is just not cool but look don't worry everyone knows what i'm remembering wasn't your idea as long as you don't hang out with her nobody's gonna hold it against you sounds like who you hang out with around here is pretty important hey this is the real world it's important no matter where you are now i'm lucky my roommate's leela yadev athletic superstar and savior of waverly's athletic program we actually get along fine probably because we're pretty much equals everyone knows who she is and everyone knows who i am a word to the wise avoid hanging out with your roommate as much as possible okay what's your take on mel all that edgy free spirit deep thinking stuff is just an act she knows she can't cut it here so she's making it look like she doesn't care i need like printouts of their pictures and their names i'm gonna get everyone's names mixed up she the is mel is the cello player right goth girl maybe she really doesn't care everybody cares what other people think in fact if they don't they're psychopaths i just learned that in ap psych have you gotten any notes from the black cat everyone on the valcan floor has the valedictorian candidate floor our floor i think the notes are kind of creepy i think they're just a stupid distraction and the person sending them should be expelled not that who that person is is any great mystery it isn't it's mel see like i said she's a little psycho and black cats strange mishaps it all fits in with that inane gothing she's got going i mean who else could it be [Music] why the black cat why isn't this person sending notes from the black snake or the red spider or something well don't tell anyone i told you this but supposedly there was a teacher here once a long time ago that none of the students liked they were always playing tricks on her scary great great grandmother or something one of their pranks gave her a heart attack and she died oh her black cat went running off into the woods during the funeral and never came back but for years after that people would spot it lurking in the shadows and whenever they did something bad would happen they said it was the teacher miss hallowell coming back as her cat to get revenge somebody around here is obviously trying to get some mileage out of a silly ghost story one the headmistress is trying desperately to squelch by the way so remember you didn't hear it from me i heard it from you i just don't remember anyone's name rachel needs it for the school website rachel roped you into helping her huh lucky you your first day you get to spend it with every loser in our class ready for my close-up darli oh i just love how mean everybody is this was a great choice this is a great choice let's go becca let's go becca it takes like two seconds and they're like hey hurry it up let's go becca there we go there it is there it is oh yeah oh yeah all right let's do a little save i get the impression rachel's not one of your favorite people she's no one's favorite people even kareem doesn't like her she seems nice enough she has no business being here either socially or academically and she knows it she makes no effort to fit in because she knows she never will gotta give her that much thanks for all the advice see ya okay learned learned a lot [Music] uh new arrivals can't can't interact with that those are roman numerals oh i don't i didn't i randomly clicked on that um what where is the oh wow oh there it is there it is lost and found [Music] um i'm gonna go online [Music] nevermind [Music] um okay is that all for the library i thought maybe i'd be able to go up but i guess not oh wait there's something over here looks like i need a key the story of four what a hamburger nope okay um is that not a door i can go to i guess i guess not i will resist my fire alarm temptation for the time being hi hi everybody hates you about you online like on your page you looked me up online well yeah it's the 21st century as soon as you meet somebody that's what you do and anyone under the age of like 30 who doesn't have something up on your page either a has been living on mars or b is seriously weird and since it doesn't look like either of those applies to you what gives i took my page down because for personal reasons well do you have a boyfriend yeah who is he where does he live come on you can tell me stuff i'm your roommate she did it i'm sorry but i i'd rather not talk about him right now she did it yeah okay whatever so what do you want to talk about so nobody likes you so what's that about i met mel she's very different yeah i think that's why we're friends she did say i was her friend right sorry that was dumb there we go sounding all insecure and loser-ish again yep are you a waverly legacy like mel is as if i earned my way into this place i was accepted because i was the most deserving applicant like ever those are my words not the schools of course but it's still true i met leela she was in the rec room she's usually in the gym either bouncing kicking hitting or throwing some kind of ball you name a sport she's great at it and competitive that girl loves to win and almost always does when did she hurt her wrist she started wrapping her wrist about a week ago but is it actually hurt debatable could she be the black cat well she's here on a scholarship so it's real hard for me to believe she's smart enough to one secretly be the black cat and two divert suspicion by faking an injury and making herself look like a victim of the black cat but i have to admit it is possible it's not because you you did it you killed all those girls or something um rachel enlisted me to help her get her web project done better you than me you don't like her let's just say she's not one of my favorite people she's kind of flaky like last month she flunked a test that took her out of the running for valedictorian technically she shouldn't even be on this floor anymore hmm yeah i'll take the photo i need to take it i'll take the photo for a web page rachel's working on that okay whip out your camera and let's get it over with cheese oh i've been taking some great photos i gotta take some regular ones because i know that it's gonna be like what are you doing i'm taking your picture i already told you they're gonna be like oh this picture shucks you can't use this on my website i'm learning i'm just you know getting some good composition here yoo-hoo i'm learning yeah yeah yeah yeah yep do you know where i can get the key that opens the special collections cabinet in the library you can get it from me how bad do you want it just give it to you kind of bad there's a book in the collection i'd really like to look at okay here's the deal i'll give you the key to the cabinet if you can finish these orthographic views for me how do i do that just figure out which views go with which object each object has a front top and side view those are examples in case you need them i can do that bring them back when you're done is this is this her homework or is this just anything else something she's challenging me see you in a bit enjoy okay yeah yeah yeah i get it [Music] oh yeah oh no did i nope [Music] okay okay [Music] is front from the front front which one's the front this has got to be the side this is top this one's front okay so front is the it's like slanted at an angle so this is going gonna be top and then front would look front with look that doesn't look like the front to me the front would look like two horizontal lines across the top this looks like the other side is the front the right side maybe the front is the okay so front is the right side okay maybe i'm just going to keep going [Music] top is the sky i think this is front front is this guy so side is this guy so front would be that side top is here front is here side is here do i save you finish those ortho views for me i think so okay let's see what we've got sorry you need to check the front view of this one anything else i'll see you in a bit fine [Music] the thing is how do i okay okay i had to click directly on it i was like i don't know how to get to the page oh no front front is here front is here maybe let me go look [Music] front okay i got front and side mixed up front is the left side [Music] [Music] right [Music] you finished those ortho views for me i think so okay let's see what we've got [ __ ] you fine i'll look at it with my eyes i'll see you in a bit is this what high schoolers are working on this is like sat prep questions i guess that's what high schoolers are working on oh front is the left front is the left front is the left front is the left okay i already fixed it but everybody please stop putting solutions and hints in the chat um do not do that you finish those ortho views for me there you go looks great thanks here's the key to the cabinet whatever books you take out be sure to put them back when you're done they're too old and fragile to carry around i will and leave the key in the lock i'll grab it later oh got it anything else no i better get going bye suit yourself no [Music] okay okay what's going on on the phone oh my demerits [Music] bad idea someone could be eavesdropping no one could be eavesdropping out here this is megan hi my name is becca sawyer i'm a new student at waverly and i just wanted to ask you a couple of questions if that's okay i mean i know you've been sick no no go ahead i'm still kind of weak but talking on the phone's not gonna kill me what exactly happened to you anyway i was eating dinner at school three nights ago when all of a sudden i couldn't breathe and when i tried to stand up i got so dizzy i fell right over so they rushed me to the hospital and by the time i got there i was turning blue and my blood pressure was down to like 40 over 20 or something whoa i'd gone in anaphylactic shock but then they pumped me full of epinephrine so by morning i was all stable and stuff my parents were real upset they dragged me home with them and they still haven't said when they're gonna let me go back i even heard them talking about suing the school anyway now i'm real upset i really miss waverly for the most part is there something about it you don't miss well maybe yeah getting poisoned or whatever ah let's see let's see what she does is there's something about it you don't miss about 10 days ago someone slipped a note under my door all it had on it were the words the black cat wants you to start packing and a paw print with some scratch marks weird then about a week later i got another note all it said was time's up i went to dinner the next night and wound up in the hospital you think whoever sent you that note tampered with your food and deliberately triggered that allergic reaction i don't know maybe it's just a coincidence i've been to the emergency room on account of my stupid allergies so many times it's ridiculous and even if someone did put something in my food i'm still here i mean i always recover it's not like they were trying to kill me or anything [Music] the thing that triggered your reaction do you have any idea what it was or how it got in your food i'm allergic to tree nuts almonds walnuts cashews my mom's always telling me to pay more attention to what i'm eating but i'm really bad at that did many kids at waverly know about your allergies before this last episode everybody knew school policy that way kids wouldn't give me anything with nuts in it at least that was the plan [Music] if you had to guess who would you say the black cat is izzy romero why her because she's the sneakiest most spiteful person i've ever known you've probably met her by now and i know she doesn't seem that way but you're new just wait okay can i take a picture of you for the school paper i'd better let you go see ya [Music] okay [Music] let's call our friends ned best isn't there a third one [Music] nancy hi you at the school i sure am so how's it going great the girls i met so far are bright and interesting and seem to like me of course they like you i hope so because i can tell already that where you fit in socially around here is huge they got a pecking order going huh and it is brutal like junior high on steroids just be yourself and you'll do fine be myself ned i'm a detective i'm pretty much here to spy on people if they get wind of that like i said just lie through your teeth and you'll do fine what about the case any luck tracking down the source of those mysterious notes they're being sent by someone who signs them as the black cat complete with a paw print and scratch marks and only valedictorian candidates have been getting them i think someone there has a grudge against brainy kids or one of the brainy kids is trying to get rid of her competition being valedictorian is that big a deal it's a very big deal the valedictorian gets a college scholarship full ride school of her choice but how smart can these kids be if they're intimidated by a bunch of silly notes it's midterm study break the kids who chose to stay at the school are cramming for tests and madly writing papers the notes may be silly but they're still distracting and some of the accidents that have followed them have been pretty malicious malicious huh you're not a hamburger no i'm not good although i am living on the same floor as they are until something or someone leads me to the black cat and in the process you're going to be very very careful right right [Music] i i guess i thought that i was posing as someone that was gonna have a shot at valedictorian because i'm on the i'm on the smart person floor is it not suspicious that they put someone not in the running on the floor i thought the whole thing was to blend in just sloppy planning i've met all the valedictorian candidates cool tell me about them no i don't want to do that can i hang up on him uh karine the girl i'm rooming with she's not exactly miss popularity what makes you say that so far i've only met one girl who even halfway likes her that's not good at this school it's a disaster keep going who else okay izzy romero is a valedictorian candidate and student body president is she nice she is to me so far but that's probably because i'm still new to the pecking order she's at the front of it oh yeah she rules the roost around here that's for sure but she's not without enemies seldom are keep going who else believe it or not there's a goth living in the room next to mine no way goth is in weird hair and disturbing body piercings she's a legacy meaning the women and her family have been attending waverly for generations if you're a legacy you're automatically accepted you're not automatically liked however she doesn't have a lot of friends doesn't seem to is she in the black cats don't know that yet maybe i'm a sucker for obvious suspects but it sounds to me like you should find out keep going it's the goth lila yadav is waverly star athlete and man is she competitive spends most of her time in the rec room trying to get people to play games with her she's a valedictorian yep shouldn't she be studying like everyone else says she's got everything under control ah smart jock good for her keep going who else this girl named rachel asked me to help her with a school project how'd you get out of that i didn't i told her i'd help her and actually it's a good thing gives me an excuse to go poking around talking to people so what's this rachel person like well no one around here seems to like her very much what is it what is it leela says she's schizoid to the point of being scary and she does tend to keep to herself the quiet loner type huh better keep an eye on her time to do something finally i can snooze soon okay you got it i'm gonna go interrogate the the goth it's definitely the goth freakish uproar thank you for the ten dollars your assessment of washington's state flag last week sent me on a fourier into uh looking at american flags as an english dude it made for very fascinating viewing i reckon washington has an awesome flag design uh it looks like a prague rock album cover okay a nice outsider's perspective of the washington state flag thank you freakish uproar i still don't like it i'm not calling best i don't want to get roped into another hour-long phone call [Music] bbb okay all right [Music] come on in becca the new girl what's going on uh did i take her picture no i didn't i need to take a close-up of you for a page on the school website i'm helping put up the school wants my picture on its website groovy blast away you think she wouldn't smile because she's a god the hold up yeah yeah there we go so take the picture i like when we end up really close to them it gives me some good uh framing to work with so take the picture i don't like that one i'm ready i don't like that one either can we please get this over with nope it's gotta be good for the yearbook or what at this website design class can we please get this over with come on fine three [Music] what's the whole do you hang out with izzy much i don't hang out with her at all i can't stand her she's so fake and vacuous it's like talking to a mannequin how can she be vacuous and be a valedictorian candidate you tell me and we'll both know are you friends with leela no although i used to be of course that was in grade school before she got caught up in sports now all she thinks about is competing and winning and school spirit stuff i just find pathetic do you think she's smart extremely which to me makes her descent into joctom even sadder do most kids like her i'm not a fan but everyone else you bet i called megan vargas yeah how is she haven't you talked to her no we're not very close any particular reason why we're just not that's all [Music] who do you think the black cat is i don't do conversations on that subject remember especially when it's so obvious that it's izzy what makes it so obvious izzy doesn't deserve to be valedictorian and she knows it she also knows she'll never get into an ivy league school unless she's valedictorian so she has to eliminate the competition i'll let you get back to your music drop in any time it's the goth i could tell by her disturbing piercings oh she has a nose her disturbing piercings you know just forget i was here bye for a second i couldn't find it but then i found it and i was disturbed okay where's everybody else living is that everybody this won't be suspicious right running around shaking locked doors okay can't go that way gotta go this way hey what's going on is it true you're here on a scholarship that's right athletic full ride although i have to maintain a pretty high grade point average in order to keep it luckily for me that's not a problem so it's okay if you aren't the valedictorian it'd be okay with the school but it sure wouldn't be okay with me no matter what i'm competing in i always play to win the nice thing is i usually do she did it she definitely did it what would happen if you got injured and couldn't play sports for the rest of the year they'd probably pull my scholarship so not only would i not be valedictorian i wouldn't even be able to graduate which would really shoot holes in my future so if i get injured again and i find out it's this black cat person's fault believe me she's gonna wind up injured too the riddler asks if this will be on youtube and it will be if you'd like to catch up with this if you you know dip out while i'm still uh streaming it'll be on youtube.com moose2 uh tomorrow morning it should be are you and izzy pretty good friends we get along we're roommates mostly because we're both valedictorian candidates and that's just the way the room assignments worked out i should make a moose to alert that's a good idea it's i thought that there was one too i thought i had a vod network command oh it's archive i'll uh i'll let it work with moose2 as well so you don't know her that well sure i do i mean with izzy what you see is what you get she's smart she's pretty she's popular she's always got a boyfriend that's izzy what more is there to know who is she popular with everybody hates everybody it doesn't seem like anyone likes anyone so i don't know where this idea of someone being popular came from i'd better get going okey dokey play some poker i want to play some poker well i'm gonna go bug people upstairs oh maybe i'll show off some of my pictures see what she thinks how about that this door's not locked we'll open it how about that locked izzy must be somewhere else you may not come in just locked take a little break washing my face [Music] um how about that this door's not locked crazy to me that i won't go in there it's crazy okay i can use the key to get this book i think the story of four by madeleine moore oh god well okay chapter six rita hollowell the accolades waverly academy routinely receives for its literature program are due in no small part to rita hallowell she was born in 1831 in baltimore maryland the youngest of four children as soon as they could reach the cash box rita and her siblings were put to work in their parents general store as a result rita learned reading writing and arithmetic at a very young age and neither received nor required any formal education but reading soon went from being a necessity to a passion and by the time she was 12 she was secretly devouring every book and newspaper that entered the store while on a rare family trip to new york city in the summer of 1846 rita witnessed a spirited public debate between edgar allan poe whose poem the raven was receiving wide acclaim and one of his critics their lively discussion awakened in rita a longing to study the literature that enthralled her and to her family's shock she refused to return home with them demanding her inheritance so she could attend new york university her father refused so rita left to pursue her dreams on her own terms but after two years she found herself in financial straits and returned to baltimore her parents forced her to enroll in a nursing program at washington college hospital a local hospital with a poor reputation there between classes and duty rotations rita continued to read and study literature as best she could on her own in 1849 poe who had become one of rita's favorite writers was admitted to the hospital incoherent and deathly ill though little is known about his brief stay in the hospital rita no doubt spent every free moment at his bedside before he died days later the exact cause of his death was unknown then and is still debated today but shortly thereafter for reasons known only to her rita suddenly left baltimore never to return she traveled upstate finding work as a teacher at several schools until she became a founding faculty member of waverly academy in 1866. for the next six years she taught literature tireless tirelessly outgoing and animated in the classroom rita was quite the opposite when not teaching her refusal to interact socially with students and faculty members alike caused many to speculate it was because she had a dark perhaps even sordid past when she died suddenly at the age of 41 rumors flew that her death was the result of a cruel practical joke uh perpetuated or perpetrated by a student who took exception to rita's eccentric behavior the fact that her beloved cat disappeared on the day of rita's funeral only to reappear for years afterward whenever something strange occurred at the school only added to rita's mystique making her the most controversial and most colorful of waverly's four founders and the board of directors is jebediah ramsey mabel whittier esther abbott harriet ramsey and rita hallowell and it was in uh 1866 that it was uh there it is again mdccclxv is that what was on the thing mc's mdccc no it is not um do i get notes for that not really [Music] oh will it just open um okay that sure looks like i need something right music making you tense it's nancy drew so you never know what's going to jump out at us and insult our hair okay so mmd cxli god uh i feel like i struggled they tried to do roman numerals with me in another game and i struggled with that too two thousand something or another two thousand i don't know what d or c is uh two thousand something something ten i don't know what l is either uh also don't i'm intentionally not looking at chat uh obviously don't tell me the answer uh 1849 1846 this is 1866 right one oh my god uh i would prefer you don't purposefully tell me incorrect answers if i had my way it would just not we just wouldn't you just wouldn't do that at all we don't have my way i i don't appreciate it i it's fine if you do but i don't appreciate it it's okay i appreciate you asking [Music] i'm just going to leave that for now uh because i just have a feeling that there's surely that's not the password to this would they write the password to the drawer on the drawer maybe 2000 dc figure it out later start at one yeah if you haven't seen me play like an adventure game before i will get stuck for days on something i would rather do that and figure it out myself so if that's frustrating to you uh maybe wait for the bods when you can skip ahead okay i thought i was going to talk to her oh hey no i'm going to talk to the goth girl about that hosta whatever it's open yeah it's already open yes it's it's been open what's the word i'll let you get back to your music door's always open i kind of thought that she would want to talk to me about that book what a hamburger um okay unlock the special collections cabinet and take a look at that morbid did that i did that did that that's done haven't done that can't check that off yet can't check that off yet can't find izzy it's okay scum i'm not i'm not upset about the spoilers just trying it's it just is how it is i've gotten better about dealing with it i've also gotten better about thinking out loud and not looking at the chat which is typically when accidents happen um i know that people on twitch are a lot more lacks with it i know i go i go a little crazy with the spoiler so that's just that's just me attach camera to usb i don't have a laptop oh library library do i have to do that work too i guess she wanted me to upload it everybody knows no spoiler i think my uh hamburger uh my classification of what a spoiler is is occasionally a little more strict than some some streams uh where's the computer how am i gonna use the comp oh the library i was gonna say how am i gonna use the computer and not use my phone in the break room what a hamburger that doesn't make any sense it's because it's in here i attached it with the usb computer yeah no plot or puzzle spoilers i don't want any i don't know why i would want one and not the other i want none i'm not reading all this [ __ ] i need to upload uh what did it say let me read the directions again open meet the candidates link select and download correct photo okay are they just making sure that i know everybody's name [Music] probably [Music] oh i literally can't do anything until i have the password i haven't played the sherlock uh homes games i guess i didn't really play the nancy drew games until i started streaming him okay i need the password are they like the same like the same as these games how's it going assuming it wasn't made by the same people apparently i need to get a password from you before i can use the school's computer that's right unfortunately i need to finish this dna model before i can give it to you too bad huh all of these genius valedictorians sure do need a lot of help from some random transfer student to do their homework want me to help you sure you bet excellent idea okay here's what you need to do you just have to make sure adenine is always paired with thymine and cytosine is always paired with guanine and make sure each pair is connected to a sugar on the alternating sugar phosphate side just jump in you'll figure it out when you're done bring it back and if you get it right i'll tell you the password sounds good all right what else is going on well i'm gonna go put together this stupid atomic molecule model for you okay so yellow is yellow and you they need okay um you can't put the adenine phosphate by the sugar uh guys sign obviously uh what a hamburger can no colors just be next to each other is it just no don't put any colors next to each other oh no you can rotate okay so obviously it's white brown white brown the way around you know where uh dna molecules go right everybody knows that [Music] i'm just going to kind of mirror what the sides are doing over there uh yeah no yes this probably doesn't go there [Music] red probably goes here guessing blue is probably there i don't know if these go don't really know i think oh there you go just look at my own dna under a microscope [Music] okay here's two yellows that are next to each other so yum yum yellow no yellow waffles is a bunny thank you for the 200 bits uh some of the dreamcatcher game studio who helped her interactive up until wolf a white wolf of icicle creek broke off to join the adventure company who are the primary creators of the 2000s sherlock and agatha christie games which are also very good thank you for that information waffles i didn't know any of that maybe we'll try a uh sherlock game are there uh hearty boys games too and harper with onions thank you for the 100 bits the one thing i remember about these games is that you could die from eating a sandwich maybe hopefully that happens today or in this game i don't i don't recall dying from eating a sandwich so [Music] maybe this is the game this guy's gotta go this guy this guy's gotta go so this guy's gotta go too okay so my guess is that the two yellows just don't don't put the two yellows together [Music] two yellows next to maybe maybe they don't have to be the same on each side i'm just gonna keep going and then she'll tell me she'll repeat her uh her story about the rules or whatever what a hamburger [Music] [Laughter] do dna is the worst we all have this [ __ ] that's ridiculous right was that was that a good observation about dna uh i will observe that i can't put any of this [ __ ] where i want it to go i can't move either of these that doesn't make any sense to me right that's weird there should be unless you don't use every single slot but that would be strange it does look like mancala brutal moose thank you so much for the five dollars what is your favorite kind of bear uh i don't know uh fatty my favorite kind of bear is is the fatty bear let's try over here maybe maybe these go together i have a feeling they don't go together but maybe they go together no it seems like they do not go together i'm gonna have her oh wait was there a thing there was i dumb and their thing there this whole time yeah i know to i know okay never mind tell me the rules i'm working on it what else is going on oh [ __ ] you come on i'll catch you later pop in anytime okay here it is i have to make sure that add add the nine is always paired with thymine okay so the black and yellows do go together um thymine [Music] and wait black and red oh no no no no no and cytosine cytosine is always paired with red and blue whatever blue is each pair is connected by sugar and alternating sugar fats okay okay well maybe i can do that i need a yellow what a hamburger what a hamburger it doesn't necessarily say that they'll rotate all the time i feel like that one has to go here it does it has to go at least around here and it can't go i guess it could go no it has to go there i feel like it has to go there all right that's not it i feel like oh that's my mistake okay okay i was like there's no way there's no way this isn't gonna work that that was screwing me up okay okay where's the single one i need there we go okay it's coming together slowly but surely i don't know about that can't be that can't can't be that that one has to go there can't go there can't go there ppp [Music] oh my god oh my god okay move this [ __ ] why did i decide to play this game because it looked fun and uh people wanted me to play another nance game there we go i'm having fun i i didn't say i wasn't having fun who said i wasn't having fun oh my god it's i'm just so close stop crying it's just torture i just can't believe i'm playing this i have to do a puzzle in a puzzle game whoa is me oh that's an interesting idea is it an interesting idea though or is it just a bad idea what if we did that i don't think that's gonna you want to quit it's the struggle is part of it i don't know that well i would describe the struggle as fun sometimes if you know what you're doing i think not knowing what you're doing is is frustrating in these kind of games but when you know all the rules and you're just trying to figure the the answer out it's just like you versus the game i find it very satisfying that's not gonna work it's just not gonna work like that um that could do it though yes i have been on this puzzle for at least maybe 15 minutes welcome to the nancy drew streams welcome there it is that wasn't even really frustrating i just had to get it done finished with that dna model yep awesome okay your password is wac35 wac35ne136 ne136 wac35ne got it thanks what else is going on does that mean i can get into a good college now what do you think your chances are for making valedictorian chance has nothing to do

actually yeah i am you and me both unfortunately i don't have a clue who has it any idea why it would be missing somebody must have wanted that book and not wanted anyone to know they wanted it that's all i can figure did it go missing before or after notes from the black cat started showing up before right before in fact i see what you're getting at it was called the black cat wasn't it that's kind of freaky i'll see you in a bit suit yourself bye let's save it's open it's already open it's already open like it was the other three times i came in here i need a photo of your roommate megan

it for you hell yeah i feel like her like model looks like it just they didn't put as much effort into it as some other people bring it on yes oh first pick your mallet then after the game starts hit the puck with your mallet and try to get it into the goal at my end you don't when i hit the puck towards your goal use your mallet to block it if you can you can only use your mallet on your half of the table first person to score seven goals wins got it got it i need to like get it on i need to memorize that and explain air hockey to someone the next time i i play it oh [ __ ] i just almost

the craziest thing i've ever heard of a goth person her disturbing piercing oops [Music] do you by any chance have a library book called the black cat and other pose stories the one that's missing from the library sure don't i've never been much into edgar he's a little over the top even for me maybe i'll pop in again later sounds good okay i like the spiders [Music] uh oh leela's not gonna like that izzy has date for oxbro bash with leela's boyfriend oops make that ex boyfriend it just kind of feels like the headmaster is like watching everything and just texting everybody updates she's just like really invested in the goings-on okay well i'm gonna knock out some more doors while i'm up here izzy must be somewhere else not now please take a hold this is my least favorite yum yum this is my least favorite one i don't want to don't want to talk to her thank you for the 200 bits harper with onions uh the first person perspective and uh music always creeped me out i like it it reminds me of mist how's it going what's this about you're stealing leela's i got holiday bash and i said yes big whoop but he was dating leela it's a free country he can date whomever he wants look i don't steal boyfriends okay i don't have to guys are just naturally attracted to me i know how conceited that sounds but it's the truth leela had a chance with this guy she couldn't cut it so now he's into me she's just gonna have to deal with it okay the missing book of stories by edgar allan poe do you by any chance know where it is uh no no offense but some of the questions you ask are kind of strange i've harassed you enough no prob she's already onto me she's already on to me she knows who i am [Music] cover blown uh okay task list what have i done still have to do that that's done still have to do that read everything on waverly school websites so i don't get into trouble and accidentally blow my cover really check did that that's done can't check that off yet that's done these are stuff that i've done can't check that off yet check check can't check that off yet still have to do that haven't done that check haven't done that see everything there is to see in the downstairs foyer i'm missing something oh well there's the piano puzzle um dab defaq uh two two three three just to dab the fact everything's two except for the dnf dab defect [Music] [Music] okay dab the oh wait it was three [Music] dab where's that one that's one [Music] dab now that has to be three no that's that is middle c i'm assuming the one with the star is middle c yum yum [Music] [Music] so uh [Music] i'm gonna look at the lampshade again do i take requests well i already played the happy birthday song that i wrote so it is getting hot in here getting hot hot hot damn okay the middle df for three [Music] [Music] so [Music] no mmm what a hamburger [Music] oh is that three no key lime satellite thank you for the two dollars that shot just heavily implied nancy just gargled toilet water and i'm so so upset you know she might have maybe it's to make sure people can't tell that uh she's a detective that's what you do because you you gargle toilet water obscurity thank you for the 100 bits give bits to ian can't check that off yet and harper with onions thank you for the 200 bits but what did you know that nancy's voice actress was roose bat from sonic's original voice actors yes i did thank you thank you very much everybody okay dab oh wait oh you can look at different parts of the of the keyboard you can look down and you can look up maybe i should check the other lampshade yeah yeah okay yeah all right i wish i had a pencil i didn't bring my pencil up here i'll just type it out for now i need to bring a pencil next time e6 a5 well the counting probably doesn't start at middle c then middle c has to be a different because they wouldn't go negative a5 b5 c5 e5 b4 c5 g 4 c4 and then the second one is d2 i wish mj would bring a pencil to me well are there magical uh music lampshades on the other side no okay so one two is here should we start with six i'll start with the lampshade on the left so one two three four five six is like way up here maybe one two three four middle c is four so e6 a5 b5 c5 e5 can i hit b4 from here oh i can go back and forth b4 [Music] c5 g4 c4 d2 is like all the way down here is that one four three two d2 that can't be right because then i can't get to a2 this has to be d2 i really wish i could get like a full keyboard i don't like getting all close a2d2 this has to be so middle c one two three so we're missing the one so when i zoom in that's c two because i only see three c's when i zoom in okay so this is two can i get to a2 i don't think that can't be right i've got something wrong this must be one somehow did i see everything in the marriage for skipping piano lessons it's like basic piano [ __ ] too i should know this can't check that off yet i haven't seen everything there is to see here unless it starts at the top maybe the numbering starts at the top instead of the bottom maybe this is that wouldn't make any sense c d e f g a i don't know take a break on that one the star definitely means middle c i just can't remember how the counting of uh music numbers works and i'm sure they clue you in somewhere it's frustrating to uh not remember that [Music] i could just assume that the low no maybe it is backwards maybe i'm backwards so if i assumed i was backwards and it went uh e now c d e f g a so that's a one a two a three a four five six [Music] how do i play piano six five five one two three four either way a one can i even get i couldn't even get assuming that i counted that way i wouldn't even be able to get to a2 i still can't see it on the keyboard okay i'm gonna look around elsewhere where is my checklist i haven't done that can't check that off yet check out the student guides that's on the computer in the library i'll do that thank you brando was i checking out the uh student guide student guide uh oh i can upload another picture there we go oh they told me that my framing was bad i got notes on all my uh my pictures and they all say i should zoom out fine you guys just you just don't know what art is i knew i knew to take two because i knew they were gonna give me [ __ ] about it i just knew it okay i can't check out the student guide i guess i have to read every single website on here or every single page every student is assigned a school work study task i am the snack shop boss failure to perform this daily task will result in three demerits black cat and other post stories oh i didn't even realize that five credits to the individual who recovers and returns the book to the library scheduled maintenance of the school's website will occur during week break uh black cat oh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah oh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah what well i gotta read everything every page on this great website uh black cat missing i mean there was a albino squirrel at uh unt the college i went to they had a whole thing about a an albino squirrel i'm pretty sure okay wait i saw something book from library special collections was stolen student caught breaking into dorm room using their id card he's locked inside mp3 player okay i need to get the picture of that person from the other person it's only fair to warn you i'm not in a very good mood right now okay because of izzy and your boyfriend of course because of izzy and my boyfriend how could she do it did she think i wouldn't mind if she started dating jacob did she think i wouldn't find out my gosh it's all over school yeah everyone got a text about it you had no idea izzy was interested in him i'm not stupid i could tell he was on her radar the way she'd look at him and flirt her brains out with him i just never figured she'd actually make a move on him while he was still dating me i mean who does that to their own roommate have you confronted her yet no and you know what i don't think i will i'm just gonna act like nothing's wrong if she's got the guts to bring up the subject fine but i'm not gonna say a word i'm gonna let her wonder just how and when i'm going to get back at her because i will definitely get back at her in the meantime i'm just gonna shake it off and get back in the game what's up girl everyone's mad that they're not talking about the boyfriend but it's like they're they're friends and roommates of course that's the drama around school nobody knows the boyfriend who's that guy nobody knows that guy did you get that picture of megan for me i've got it right here but the only way you're going to get it from me is by beating me at scram what do you say what same as before bring it on yes okay oh hell yeah two rounds you play one round as the blocker and the other round as the scorer and you take turns throwing the darts first the blocker throws three darts then the score throws three darts and so on the object of the game is for the blocker to end the round by landing a dart in any section of all 20 numbers while the object of the game for the score is naturally to accumulate as many points as possible before the round ends i assume that hitting the bullseye is worth 50 points and hitting the ring outside it is worth 25 that's right once all the numbers are blocked the rolls are reversed and you play another round after two rounds the most points wins i just want to throw the difference in regular darts the harder the section of any number is to hit the more points so you ready i'm ready game on so in this round you're the blocker and you're going to try to hit the high numbers so they get crossed off the score list i think i got it okay so now it's my turn to throw and i get to score guess i better go for the high numbers before you take them out oh do you just like yes nailed it [Music] very uh oopsie very confused all right i did it i did it nailed it uh one i did it four 20 25 it's 25 the outer bullseye darn it 15 14 15. all right all right am i not getting triples for these i guess i can't tell if i'm hitting them [Music] missed 15 14 13. isn't she supposed to be blocking out these numbers all right i just keep hitting 15. gosh i'm good um what a hamburger gosh i'm good are you i barely know the rules but i think you're doing very badly i did it you do get triples oh yeah all right oh yeah yes uh seven darn oopsie darn why don't i not get points for that oh seven was blocked out i think this is only round one too i think there's a whole other round after this where i'm blocking and she's uh all right yes finally i did it that works uh 19 18 that works 17. yes nailed it 16. bingo 15 14. that works [Music] leela had no points because uh i was scoring nailed it and she was blocking now i'm blocking so in this round all right i'm checking off these numbers so she can no longer use them to score points so i'm just going from top to bottom so she has less opportunity to score points all right yes so the most she can score is 33 i guess if she hits the middle blew that bingo that works yes their strategy uh it just would come into play more if i couldn't just click and remove uh i did it whatever that works since there's no skill uh it it kind of takes away the strategy too yes oh yeah blew that [Music] yes this would be very fun in real life this would be very intense nailed it bingo looks like i'll have to take a picture of a picture gotta get that one guys don't make fun of her she has food allergies all done you can keep it thanks you can't bully someone who's got allergies no thanks need anything else no i better get going bye what's up roomie no i'll see you in a bit later save save all right i i am done it's about three i gotta go get my car fixed
