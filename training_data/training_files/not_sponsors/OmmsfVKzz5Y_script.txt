make your next move with Squarespace stress depression irritability these are all side effects of a drug I take every day called social media tell me if this story rings true to you one day you hop online to your favorite social network because well actually you don't really know why you logged on it's just it's just kind of what you do now it's a drug addiction like I said anyway you hop on your favorite social network just to see what's going on in the world and you notice that one of your friends has posted something controversial I don't normally post about this kind of thing but I can't remain silent any longer maybe it's a link to an article maybe it's a political meme maybe it's just a write whatever it is the flood gates have been opened seventy-nine comments it says and a lot of them are really long comment well you weren't planning on doing anything productive for the next hour so let's just uh sit here and then read every single one of these so you click through and you you really start to read the entire thing but you don't really know why you're doing this because this whole thing is it's actually really stressing you out oh maybe I should insert something into this conversation you know put my two cents in you start to type of reply and we delete it then you start to type another reply again let me delete it again oh what's the point what's the point of anything anymore you walk away from the computer suggestion afraid empty I mean this is what social media has become there's only so much muting and unfollowing that one can do before one is is done like why do we keep doing this to ourselves hey guys just when to stop by real quick and see what we're going on oh really wow this is really healthy I mean you want to contribute okay to the conversation but you're well aware that you'll probably be smacked down in two seconds by some doctor weight or statistic that you didn't even know existed well please tell me your opinion I would love to here it well here's the thing uh-huh I think that penis that's incorrect okay well even if this might be tralala I still wrong that you hadn't considered that got anything else for me I'd love to hear it what's the point that was close I was running out of materials so what's the point of any of it you're just scrolling through non-stop disagreements debates an argument yes you don't even know what you want to believe anymore remember when all you did on Facebook we was like post pictures with your friends and stuff those were the days man they hadn't even broken up yet and she had already changed her relationship status on that Facebook website I don't know man that changes too much wrong on the places away and people that are carefully our weapon especially promess my friend it only goes downhill from here no look okay I I have a theory actually about why social media has become as bad as it is and I may be wrong but this is just a thought maybe just maybe we all live in separate realities people that populate each reality don't want to admit that there are other realities that exist simultaneously and it's always been this way but we just found out about it because now all of the realities you know concrete and into one shared reality called social media oh my gosh I think that's what it is everyone lives in an echo chamber in their normal real life hey when you go online just definitely aware that there are a lot a lot more opinions and perspectives and you are comfortable with what instead of empathizing and learning from all these different realities people just assume that their version of reality is the right one and all the other realities are incorrect obviously they're then they're completely 100% wrong and that's what causes this very stressful environment oh please God please God let this Facebook comment debate be the most influence that these two people will ever ask so what's the solution Jordan I don't know okay I don't know I do know this when you start to get stressed out by social media you you know you should probably just go find something better to do it's not like you need to be there okay it's probably a bad use of your time anyway besides so people there are lost okay you can't help them you can't change their mind but what you can do is walk away that's the only way you can control the situation leave the arguing and grandstanding for the people who are doing anything productive in their lives other than typing seriously for hours on end and just think while they sit on their butts in social media land you can spend your time actually working to make the world a better place in real life or do push-ups now doesn't that sound like the opposite of a stressful thought in fact that sounds like a very
