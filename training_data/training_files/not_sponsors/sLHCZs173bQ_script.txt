I don't think they're on to go through the helmet kill somebody and then go through another helmet hi my name is Daniel Rivera a Mateo marine Corvette formics row instructor and I've shot expert on the rifle range seven years in and subscribe to game ology for more gaming videos like this right in the moustache I think it's pretty cool they have a comment fatality finish well it's going through the brain I'm a big fan of the little heart meet on the left side something I've never seen in the video game I think it's pretty cool for this shows his heart is a breathing I like how when it's like speeding up I mean the shots gonna be awesome I guess that natural respiratory pause it's like the perfect time of shoot I like that a lot like Call of Duty like for example it's one of the most popular shooting game you have to hold down the vines Reeves take a good deep breath and hold your breath try to hold that natural respiratory pause natural respiratory pause is a natural respiratory pause is any break in between reps so you breathe in and you blow out and at the last bit of your exhale it's that natural respiratory pause but everything is still everything is focused that's when you have that slow steady squeezing the trigger for that accurate shot and then after you pull the trigger click you inhale again I think the Springfield I want to say it's 7 6 - I don't know about going to a camera going to the brain coming out there the Kevlar hitting another Kevlar I don't think that's possible look for the one maybe one person I think that's fine I like that screen and actually I like how that scope has like a good sense of what's where the lines go determine where you're aiming at nice dragon sleeper that's what I'm talking about that's my commission move right there when I rested deuteron X and for one special [Music] that man not having any kids forget truck destroyed I'm as testicles when destroyed before when I said I wanted to see him shoot somebody to kneecap I really wanted to say I want to see him shoot some iron nuts to see what would happen I'm so happy we had that combat glad you know like so like they teach us the same thing when we're moving in there's people like you know we're combat like it so we're alert we're ready cuz at this position right here we we can drop to a knee fast we could drive all the way down to the problem we can stand up and run from there so it's kind of like a tactical walk you know that allows you to have like good posture good control of the weapon you know walking up straight you know so stop tolerance tip we're kind of relaxed and flex and you know you're moving slowly and crudely because from that position he could drop down he he could throw he could run - I think they don't try to show the best way possible of what a combat Glide looks like you saw her right there he wasn't aimed with the center of the cross how he's slightly moved it up do you heard that where he's aiming at right now compared to where he hits yeah that's - see that's that's that kentuckyone call he's offsetting for the gravity and endo and the wind Oh so basically when you're sighted in an unknown distance for example when you fire if you're aiming dead center and you're not taking into the account that that bullet has to travel six hundred eight hundred meters how many meters he's shooting here that Iran is not gonna hit where you're aiming at because gravity is gonna pull it all the wind is gonna take it and move it maybe he's using the trees may be easy to smoke in the air or whatever he's using to determine which way the winds blowing he offsets aims and he shoots it's gonna hit exactly where he wants because of the distance and how he took into account of the trajectory of the round Kevlar helmets here they're designed to protect you from seven six tubes five five six rounds but the ones that had helmets I don't think it's popular for that that round to go through the helmet kill somebody and then go through another helmet because once it hits that Kevlar it's gonna it's gonna slow down the speed of the round oh and hey combat in this game okay oh he's facepalm smash to be basically facepalm strike that man's nose into his brain you definitely want to set up in a in a concealed cupboard position further away where you can see the majority of the area and which your team or whatever it is you're trading once they find out where you are now you're figuring for example like in this clip we're watching right here there's several machine guns shooting at you and you have a both action sniper rifle you're gonna get out gun you're both action sniper rifle isn't faceted seven or eight guys shooting actually with semi-automatic weapons or automatic submachine guns or rifles so you want to stay in a good spot a good vantage point but once you're found or once they know where you're at you want to move to another place you don't want to say still stadium just in Miami and then shoot Oh your life when you shoot that is not happy that is slow motion I don't think it's possible to shoot for people with one bullet I don't think it's possible to kill three people one bullet but I thought that was pretty cool it all went through the eye so maybe maybe they were all perfectly aligned and all their eyes when the exact same spot so he shot because hit every eye we're gonna have like all my beautiful arms like in here desert Kami's I have my dress blues of my woodland camouflage and my alpha uniform I'm not in the Marines anymore I got out I got sober side they just say the closet not like us [Music]
