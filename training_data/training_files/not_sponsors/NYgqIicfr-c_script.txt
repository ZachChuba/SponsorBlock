when a single jump is a deciding factor in whether or not you'll receive a prize how do you decide on the way you'll attempt the jump maybe you should go for the right corner as it looks like the closest point you could also aim for the middle or maybe the left side no matter which path you choose to take in a few seconds you're either going to be 100 richer or not before jumping forward let me explain to you how this works a few days ago my goal was to create a jump that would be so hard to do only a very small portion of those who attempted it could make it now something i had initially tried was using some of the items in rust you think would be best in order to accomplish what i was looking for such as a lantern or the blue flashlight which happened to be the smallest object i could find regardless with both of those objects i always came to the same problem it was just too easy to predict rust is not one of those games where making a jump is difficult it's honestly quite easy and in this situation i had multiple people test it out and they would nail the jump first try so i had to come up with something more challenging you see there is only one way to make this jump although the right side looks a little closer if you try to jump towards it it is actually a little bit further away all you have to do is jump on the left side of the door that is literally all there is to it let's see how the many people of my rust servers perform on this jump and get 15 off your order that's at byraycon.com c d blood oh no that's bad hey that was an accident i'm serious i did not mean to do that i thought it was awake [ __ ] out of me jesus hey yo that's a nice box oh my god it's dandy oh my god what the [ __ ] i was just watching your amphibious video i love that video which one later what the [ __ ] which video the amphibious video were you only one in the water oh wait that was blue yeah you scared the [ __ ] out of me i ain't gonna lie yo who the [ __ ] are you who are you i don't know you're the one on my base oh hey bro who are you [Music] why are you shooting me you are the admin okay because i thought you were just some random guy spawning in my base you scared me you didn't tell me that happened sorry dude jeez i didn't know how to show you my id and all that hey you got a mic microphone in 2020 you have a mic do this oh you do nice it's 20 20 after all everyone should have a mic [Music] you can't hear me [Music] hey you got a mic nice you do yes yo you got a mic did i lift the door open no i'm the server owner i can just fly in you know oh cnb blood [Music] i don't know how else to like appear you know got a mic you scared me oh my god what's going on holy [ __ ] sorry about that [Music] yo you got a mike hello there how are you doing nice hello there you want to win some uh some coins uh how'd you get in here you just get the [ __ ] out of me dog everyone says that uh i don't know i just walked in you just scared the [ __ ] out of me after a long session of showing up to people's bases and offering them this opportunity it was time to put them to the test do you have any idea what i'm gonna ask you to do no clue come over here and look down this way all right so here's how this works okay if you make it on that door all right as long as you're on that door and you don't fall off or anything you win 25 but you get one attempt when you feel ready you you were sorry i couldn't i you're my cut out oh you're standing up stand up right now okay okay you know it's a big deal right now yeah dude on your go uh it's a very tricky jump but i'm hoping somebody's going to be able to do it all right give it give it a go whenever you feel okay they always go so quick they don't even give it a chance this is how you do it just jump and you gotta land right on the corner i can't tell if the door is like flat like i can land on it or like it's like upright and i land on the corner well i'm glad you're thinking keep thinking dude all right so am i am i supposed am i supposed to land do i land on it and uh like stay on it yeah you have to stay on it you can't like if you jump on it and hit it and then slip off that's that's uh that's gg's all right all right here we go then uh i feel so sad no one's actually done it are you gonna you're gonna take some time to figure this out you're just gonna wing it dude [Music] all right man damn not even close i don't like that it's about to be nighttime this is going to be hard harder okay do people fall off a lot well i've done this with uh nine i think or uh how many eight other people and every single one of them have failed it's kind of depressing i didn't know i made it that hard but i can do it first try every time yeah it's kind of sad [Music] uh you make it on there you get 25 you have one try make sure you know exactly how you okay uh no one really even tries to feel like so who wants to try first [Music] that's depressing well it's your turn one attempt oh dude she almost got it that was so close i was the first person to almost make it so am i just jumping to the board is that it well you want to jump on that uh on that on that uh it's a door god damn on that door yeah but it's a it's a hard jump like i said it doesn't look okay it's not as easy as it looks i'll just say that it's a tricky one okay here we go uh they all aim for the point man they all aim for the point after the session ended it was clear to me that i would need more people for this challenge as it appeared i had made the jump a little okay well it was way too hard but to be fair i honestly did not expect it to go this route at this point i had truly expected to get at least one person to make it by now [Music] [Music] rip [Music] people have tried and none of them have made it and you haven't [Music] well there's a good try man [Music] just don't you know believe in you okay [Music] 100 bucks in your name okay [Music] [ __ ] once you make it on top of it and you stay on it for like four seconds it doesn't matter take your time oh that works too [Music] [Music] all right you only get one try okay that's a very very bad try grip okay so after 50 different players attempted this jump it turns out none of them could make it but i had invested so much time into this video already so i still wanted to make something out of it even though no one completed the jump i hope you guys understand where i'm coming from and since i wasn't able to give out a hundred dollars as my budget was for this video i decided i would add in four different amazon gift cards throughout this video each of them containing 25 in us currency and look if you're mad that i mentioned this at the end of this video you probably don't deserve to get a code in the first place i've had some people get mad at me for mentioning this at the end of the video not in the beginning like it's some kind of race to get it and you know at the same time it is but it's also not really cool to show off that you're only watching this video to win a giveaway and i'm not asking you to like this video subscribe or do anything like that in order to win this money you just have to find the codes that are scattered across this video it just wouldn't feel right to upload a video like this without giving away the hundred dollars i intended to give out anyways guys i hope you all enjoyed this video i honestly had a blast making this and would love to make more similar to this if you think i should as well that's when i'd ask you to like this video if you enjoyed it of course and to subscribe if you do want to see some more but with all that being said thank you guys for watching this video and that's it peace
