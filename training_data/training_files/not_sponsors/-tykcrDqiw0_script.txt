Hey so way back when in the 17th century so like a million years ago Isaac Newton and the judge astronomer Christiaan Huygens were both thinking about life and what it was made up of but when they both thought about it they came to very different conclusions the main issue was that any theory about the nature of light had to explain reflection and refraction and diffraction and color and I'm sure you don't need me to explain what reflection and color are but the other 2 may need a little bit of explaining so refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one substance to another substance and it's how lenses can focus light and diffraction is the spreading out of light when it passes through a very narrow gap so before newton's experiments it was generally accepted that light gained this colour by interacting with matter so that famous rainbow effect seen when light passes through a prism is created because the prism has somehow stay in the light but Newton showed that the white light that we can see is actually in fact a mixture of different colors of light and these colors are split by a prism because they are all refracted by different amounts and along with all the other big boy philosophers at the time Newton believed that lie consisted of a stream of particles and if life was a stream of particles then this could potentially explain how light could travel in straight lines on how it could bounce off reflective surfaces it could also explain refraction in terms of forces at the boundaries between different materials however however newton's theory as good as it was I mean I couldn't have come up with anything half as good it didn't explain how when light hits several surfaces some was reflected and some was refracted so on the other hand we had Christian Huygens right and he argued that space was full of weightless particles the ether and that light caused disturbances in the ether that spread out in spherical waves refraction was then explained if different substances say like ether water or glass caused light waves to travel at different speeds so his theory could explain why both reflection and refraction can occur at a surface and it could also explain diffraction too so I expected his theory was disregarded mainly disregarded by the other and science at the time because that's just how it is ain't it and the thing was that Newton was one of them big lats but like a century later a chap called Thomas Young show that light actually does behave like a wave and and and more mind-blowing Lee experiments in the 20th century demonstrated that not only does light behave like a wave but it also behaves like a particle too however there are pretty big differences between Omen Huygens spherical waves and our modern models of light but considering what tools he had at the time fair bloody play to him so Huygens also said that light waves for a long acute '''l as they pass through a substance ether and like I mentioned in my video about waves sound waves they're also longer to denilla waves in which the particles of the substance the wave is passing through vibrate in the same direction of the waves traveling our modern view of light waves is that they're transverse waves that behave more like waves of water they do not need matter to transmit or propagate while particles vibrate at right angles up down to the waves and direction and this little hundred so go check out what you put us into and if you liked this video give it a thumbs up if you want to see more hit subscribe a big thank you to my patrons on patreon and thank you for watching bye
