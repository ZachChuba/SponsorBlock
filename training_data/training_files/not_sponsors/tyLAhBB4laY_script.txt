you bring people on to embarrass and torture them what and yes you do i've seen i i've got you all sourced out i've seen people not everyone only the ones that enjoy it um they said poop and condoms i forgot to tell them that i had direct syndrome so i just turned and i looked over my shoulder and like you're like a fisticute and she just did that like i love you i love you too [Music] but we just met i love you i love you too oh yeah i think terence is a bit fond of you wait parents that's what we call tourette's so that people know the difference oh really yeah so i have a tick where i literally say i love you oh my god i love that dick yes yes oh my god thank you i have hats lots of hats and they make me wear them they think they redeem points and i have to wear them another one yeah it's a channel points thing so this is my unicorn hurt look um i have quite a few can wait wait can i see where'd you get it so this one was given to me um really awesome viewers sent it in the p.o box um yeah i want though okay i wanna i wanna get a po box because i want my viewers to send me yeah um there's some really awesome ones that will um if you get a really fancy one they'll even open the packages beforehand and make sure that they're not poop or condoms and stuff because you know some people send interesting things they send poop and condoms uh-huh you got you've got a pole you've got a um a stripper pole now now i don't have a stripper pole technician has a stripper pole i'm sorry okay and your technician has a uh and it's not a stripper pole it's just a pool yeah because it only becomes a stripper pole if you pick if you're stripping i see so you don't you like you don't do like the full strip dance you you just do those the dance part yeah it does the tricks well not me the technician does the tricks you know well that's pretty nifty would you like to learn i don't know if it's safe for me to i don't have full control over my limbs oh so oh yeah okay yeah i i want to do lots of physical stuff um but i am nervous to you like i tried to drive once and um nearly killed four people so i i'm very very careful with the physical activities that i choose to do especially ones that take consistent coordination i i watched a clip or a video of you saying like you you were having intercourse with one of your boyfriends and you accidentally punched his dick oh yeah yeah yeah um so i have a matching tick uh for me probably a lot better than for him but i don't think either of us really i don't think he was either we didn't you know that didn't really happen again because he's dead um [Music] [Laughter] punch oh i love breakfast what's your favorite breakfast curry curry yeah i like kerry for breakfast wait curry for breakfast or maybe a leftover vindaloo yeah wait isn't that a dinner meal well i need to eat as many calories as i can in the morning because i'm going to need it throughout the day a lot because i burn a lot of extra calories because it ticks wait around what is that yeah yeah yeah yeah thousands for some people especially for most of their ticks and motor which is the body ones so like some people most of their most of the ticks are like um they'll make gestures at people um the one that i do the most is this but some people will like jump on the spot some people dance i used to have a dancing ticket it was so annoying um [Laughter] um so like i would kind of just like do this up and down with my arms and then like shoot me from side to side and stuff like this just couldn't stop and it's really embarrassing in shops and stuff but i used to have a partner at the time and he used to uh [ __ ] he used to be a [ __ ] he's dead wow he used to be a bummer he used to um just dance with me more vigorously to draw attention away from me because he already knew i was embarrassed he's like [ __ ] it it's time it's time to take away the focus and he just and he'd be the best dancing he'd be like doing the worm on the floor in front of everybody just look at me wow [Music] this is a legitimate confession okay it's just a tick okay okay someone's a murderer no no [Applause] he's in the garden he's in the garden what's his name like this breakfast breakfast are you okay if you're stuck in the closet and in the garden blink your eyes no i can't wait to be able to see it stay safe say something he's happy he's yeah he's living he's on a farm you know it's a really lovely place you know with lots of other ex-boyfriends how many of them are in the form uh not enough um uh i've only had three boyfriends how many is enough i guess we'll find out [Laughter] i like you miss anita so your breakfast cereal oh what type of breakfast cereal wow a cheerio i like frosted flakes better i'm i'm over the flex bag yeah i've been a fan for a very long time really yeah you're terrible yeah like i am i kind of wonder how i'm still here because uh i got blended into streaming by accident i never planned to stream and i gave it a go thinking that it would last a couple of weeks so i never got good and i never got to be a pro streamer and i thought everyone will get bored of me because people only watch because of my condition right no i know i've been here for nearly three years and none of you have left well okay do you know why i watch you why because you're eloquent like the things that you say like the way you string off words wait what oh the way it is sorry no no worries no worries i just want to know what you said um i just said let's okay save that same but then whenever i talk whenever i listen to you you just state things in a way where it's like five head it's like 10 heads like i can't i can't explain it i don't know i think he took just fine i've actually been watching a few clips of you i was like i need to understand what's going to happen because i have no idea what this is going to be like so i had a little sneak peek at your stuff on youtube yeah i figured you out yeah really yeah you you bring people on to embarrass and torture them um what and that's yes you do i've seen i i i've got you all sourced out of people not everyone only the ones that enjoy it well that's gonna be it's gonna be all of us we're streamers we we're we we humiliate ourselves for a living it'd be kind of weird if we weren't into it so i guess she picked the right thing to do like uh because obviously most if for a streamer we're gonna get we're gonna be into it that's true wait okay miss anita you need to roast me [Music] you have to do it okay roast me um let me give me a sec i'm not as good at terra as terrance at um or roasting people wait can parents roast me everyone says that they're like roasted because he's really good but the problem is he doesn't do it with the heat yeah because he always talks about his dick oh i'd be very surprised if terrence was a lady uh because constantly he makes me do things like make eye contact with people at the shop who were like would you like a bag with that and i'm like i have a dick um so yeah he he he's definitely he but uh uh uh if people can roast me then the thing is a lot a lot of tourette a lot of tics end up being inappropriate because an invasive thought is more likely to trigger a tick and so if you don't want to say something you're more likely to say it if people give you permission to say it's less likely to happen especially as a tick that's a gross you know yeah you know um another good wait so so if you tick then you're not having fun right or i'm just distracted oh you're distracted yeah and that's when you punch the dick that's what i might punch the dick i have also said uh other people's names um i have also take just anything the worst thing you can imagine doing in bed i've probably done it in bed because as a tick so yeah that's that's pretty hot why are you asking me this is my sister's question he's in he's in he's in the fridge he's in oh my god he's in the fridge at least keep them together why why because then you can keep track of them if you keep one of the breakfasts some in the lunch box some in the dinner some in the supper summon your mother um so this is going well huh oh my god stop in the lunchbox oh my god miss anita okay i have to okay holy [ __ ] hold on hold on phone call just one second one second up goddammit okay wait wait wait wait i have this is your mom did she like the sausage um you know funny thing is that she actually it is something to do with my mom sorry about that i got i got i got whoa this is one of your boyfriends what that you just burned no no no this guy this dead guy this is one of your boyfriends uh no he looks a bit tall for me okay okay wait you like smaller guys um what area and um so i do like a guy i can make eye contact with yeah wait how how tall are you five to you wait you like wait wait wait you like guys we're like five two to be honest i don't have a size preference uh so long as they fit in the fridge as long as they lost as long as they not as long as they take it in the butt as long as they wet so long i don't have a blend i don't have a bread i don't have breakfast cereal i don't have perfect science preference spidey job i've had a tall boyfriend i've had a very short boyfriend and i've had just an average sized boyfriend so i guess i've i've had a tester from each kind of bracket and to be honest i can't really attribute a tear system what about you do you have any preference [Music] oh you've been muted oh no did your chat do that to you [Music] sorry mine suck as well they're [Music] either actually my technician's current boyfriend is like five five five six by five so yeah but you like them short because you want to put them in the fridge i find that there are ways of means to get anyone in the fridge if you try hard enough so i guess that's you know i'm kind of fine either way is this a common thing that you like to do um i like chili with the willy i like him but i like uh um not really just depends on you know if they give a good head if they if they sorry i didn't expect that one it's okay it's okay it's okay i mean my head is my head it's okay we're you know what a good head it means everything you know i i agree 100 good head means a great thing so this is what so my attack can control my body and they can make me dance whenever whatever um so that's why i i just thought you were really excited about good head well i can relate so that too once you get cleaner guys there's a street gun in my house clear okay so miss i'm sorry that's another vibration i have a lot of bugs in my system um yeah that's it there's medication for that really it's like a vibrating look you know like mine i just start vibrating really violently like after i dance huh would you be fine with vibrating violently on your chair hell yeah i can think of a few uses for that wait think of a few uses i wish if you're with a lady this a oh or are you actually saying these things i'm actually saying these things i'm sorry i know that sometimes it's hard to tell the difference but okay so would you be down to half you know okay like this this is what happens oh yeah that i can think of a few uses for that yeah that's a skill that's not a problem really do you think it has a keyboard yeah yeah definitely this isn't a sex thing is it oh if you really want it to be miss anita this is a g-rated channel uh-huh i can tell yeah they wearing boxes because you know they gotta cover their willy between dang a girl and a guy it's probably whether or not saying you're taking scares guys off at the bar you see if you say i'm sorry i have a boyfriend people like okay yeah if you say i'm sorry i have a girlfriend they're like cool i love threesomes so it's much more difficult to get people to back off but apart from that not really that different people like to think that like women are going to be this or that as if like women are generic things that have like set traits that are predictable and they don't like there's no way to tell whether or not someone's going to be good in bed a good partner a kind person a listener um a mean person by what jim caleb they have so they're not that many differences who's better in bed women i figured because they know how to navigate a woman's body right yeah and yeah it doesn't end when they're done like it's not gonna be like 30 seconds and then i'm like cool thanks babe like it doesn't just like finish because they're finished you know what i'm saying yeah so it can last like you can have snack breaks and go for like hours what okay now i want to try yeah it's pretty good and also there's like you don't no matter what size preference you have a woman can accommodate because it's detachable whereas dudes it's like you know you don't even get to know what size it is before you get you know so like you could get a boyfriend and then get with them and then start doing the jazzing and stuff you know and then whatever they've got is what you're getting for the next few years yes with a woman like with a woman it's like you know what i fancy something bigger or smaller they're like no problem i just hop on amazon so that's a good perk too i never thought about it like that i have never been with a woman but it is something that i have fantasized sorry about the chaos you should be sorry [ __ ] sorry did you just call this school [ __ ] um did she like it um sorry yeah i did kind of like it i did kind of like it miss anita hello nice to meet you my name is fish cole how are you doing nice to meet you

i'm running and running and running and running really fast but like i'm really hungry as i run and um pretty much what happens is like okay actually this is this stream is too weird i think you know what this stream is way too weird for me to describe on twitch so i'm gonna save it for a private time okay i have i have like cookies and stuff cookies wait you would see me cookies yeah i make really good cookies wait why why are you trying to feed me are you trying to stuff me into the fridge um only if you want to be in the fridge i have other more comfortable places in the house okay

pizza okay i'll get pizza perfect oh pizza i thought it was pizza oh my god oh i left the headset hold on i can't hear you okay oh my god it's like a baby he's like a baby he's so big how old is he oh he just looks big because i'm small he's um we don't actually know because he's a rescue i only ever rescue animals he's so awesome fluffy and he just oh my god it's like a living stuffed animal he's a little tara though but his previous owners didn't want him because he destroys things and he attacks other rabbits and stuff he's a little ball of hate but he's nice to me so how long have you had him for quite a while now i think i got him either early last year or the year before um i got him because anya was really lonely her husband died so i bought an other deploy i went out into a rescue center with a friend to get him to keep her company but well he attacked her oh so they don't live together and now i just i keep them both company myself because they love each other what happened to the husband so her husband passed away he was called nudge um he got a condition called stasis which is like if rabbits get gas it can be very serious so his digestive system just went comfort one day we did our best i was with him like until the end just trying to get it sorted normally i could get rabbits to survive it even that's difficult for them to survive but he just didn't quite make it so um yeah i waited a while to get i knew a new husband but they couldn't take um but they both have castles and lots and lots of treats and toys and he has a stuffed animal he has a um snake that he loves he loves his steak he drags the snake around the room by the tongue oh what a little devil dragging the snake by its tongue he's a bundle of joy i like him a lot yeah no can i take him you have another one already come on don't be so greedy i don't i don't share my rabbits there's a rule like i literally want people when they come in my house whatever you do to my rabbits i'll do to you so you better be nice to them oh what if i [ __ ] your rabbit okay stop sorry sorry sorry that was that was glitch oh that was a glitch i can i could tell like yeah thank you i could tell by the um you had a little bit of a yeah yeah i have this so i have a i have a glitch that basically is like a different personality she kind of pops up sometimes hello hi [Music] how are you doing ready for this date let's go okay okay i'm down how for how long how long do you have to live uh oh okay is that a threat i like my women being a little bit threatening it's fun to role play that's consent that is what you said i love you too oh my god i think we're gonna be pals yeah [ __ ] off glitches would really get on yeah terrace and glitch would really get on well i love you i love you too when is winston i love you take when did that come on i don't know and i don't know why either i think it is like it's good it's been here for at least half a year now and i have no idea why because i don't say that to anyone so i don't know why it's so sweet are you having fun are you yeah are you sure yeah are you really really sure yeah taryn just just try not to ask me about the um the fridge anymore i don't want to end up in prison just yet oh don't worry don't worry don't worry we i will stay clear from the wait what yeah that is advisable how do you like streaming so far it's cool um i like it in lots of different ways i think part of it is that like there's been a lot of lockdowns so it's the kind of job where you can still pay the bills and have some security even though the world is going to hell yeah um [Music] it's harder it's harder to follow it's harder for people to follow you home when you don't leave it so it's great in relation to stalkers too jesus christ you've had a lot of stalkers not like no kidding yeah i i at college i had a guy who had he um thought that all of my tics were sending him psychic signals i didn't know who he was but he sent me a message and it was clear he knew where i lived where i went to socialize with my friends it was clear that he knew when i went to the library to study and things like this and i had no clue i got good you got what oh i always tell people i have bread even though i don't have bread bread yeah i always i have a lot of tips about bread wait what type of bread i got tiger bread i don't like that that was the last thing i drew oh it's so pretty yeah oh my god i did that one on stream i have i like colored pencils um but i've been drawing it since i was little um one of the drawings in this box i did when i was nine so i've been drawing for a long time people were concerned about me as a kid wow yeah you do that when you're a nine yeah um i have a gene my family's all good at art that look like um of just steam chains he loves steam dreams but yeah a lot of people in my family can just draw it just you just wake up one day and you just know how it's like none of us really practice that much yeah oh my gosh you're so talented thank you i barely ever do any drawings because ah i'm a synth because [ __ ] because i have dick because i have cat because i'm so busy dick and cat and a uh-huh they tend to get in the way when you you know when you try to draw wait do your ticks actually like do they take over when you draw like when you're like drawing like a fish or something and do they try to give it a peanut [Music] um oh i'm sorry it's okay now i'm a ghost with big bubbles [Music] that's that's new nice miss nita you were saying uh so this thing called copper graffia which is when you write ticks um but so i have a piece of paper that i put over my drawing yeah and i pull i pull the piece of paper i rust my hand on it and i do the bit above the piece of paper and i'm very careful careful to keep as little of it exposed as possible because i will write things so i'll usually write things below the bit i'm working on so if i have my hand resting on a piece of paper on top of it then i'll write all the words on the piece of paper instead of the artwork so that's how i cope with it do you ever like text like is there a texting tick well the thing is it's the thing is it usually isn't complex enough to make me hit send so usually if i type something i don't want to actually say then i'll type it and then delete it and then write what i actually want to say oh what is the craziest take story chat which one do you think i should tell her about because there are quite a lot what you guys what's the craziest tick story you've heard from me terry crews oh yeah i i offered terry cruiser fisting wait you fisted terry crews no i just offered to and he ran away wait wait seriously uh-huh and i went for a wee and when i came back i didn't know but everyone else was playing asked him to go get his dad so he went and got his dad and his dad was on the mic instead of his son so i came back and i was like hi and you went high and i was like would you like a fisting and he's like so i've got to go guys oh my god escaped um so the weirdest thing i did this year was offer a terry cruiser fisting and unfortunately he didn't pick me up on the offer but um before that i um i felt so i used to do rescue work the one i usually go to one that everyone suggested is the ambulance so um basically i was butt naked and i offered to fist a lady in the back of an ambulance um and before you look at me like that there is a legit reason i am not as crazy as that sounds you see i used to do rescue work which involved going out into the countryside and i was with my team and we were crossing this field and it had a cesspit in it and a cesspit is where farmers dump their bodies of dead cattle they put all of the poop and pee in there and make lots of waste products and chemicals and anything because there's a lot of chemicals involved in dairy farming and stuff like that so it has like corrosive acid dead bodies poop pee and it was connected to their sewage system so it also had humanness growing in it too and this is where you keep your dead bodies your exes um no like why why because you said they were in the farm why wait oh you said they were in a floor wait wait get me why wait i tried so hard not to um so basically no that's this i didn't see any of my boyfriends in there luckily but um what happened was like the fat in poop house do you float to the top like this hard layer so it looked like a gray car park it just looked like a rubbly rape car park yeah and i did not know what it was so i walked up this little this little ridge and stepped on it and my my foot just went through it and i was suddenly neck deep in all of the awfulness in a set cesspit and none of my friends could help me get out because the fumes can knock you out so there are whole families who die in cesspits because one will fall in because they were knocked out by the fumes another will try to rescue them and get knocked out by the fumes and you know like six or seven family members will die at a farm because of this they're really dangerous do you want to stand back and just watch me swim in the poop try to get out by myself and i did and they called uh some firemen who came because what happened after that was we radioed into our vehicle and said you know we have a situation could you come to this location to pick us up because obviously i was gonna need some help um you don't fall in acid and poop and just come out okay so um so this vehicle comes rushing in doesn't know the situation and tries to park and what it thinks is a car park and so it just comes straight through the fence and just goes straight into the cesspit um so i'm out and there's this massive trail of like ick leading from me to the cesspit as i you know because like fall out and now the the land rover is halfway in it and he's had slammed the brakes and half is out and half is in and he's just in there half in there staring death in the face just like holding keeping his foot on the brake and so he lights the cigarette whilst he's waiting for rescue because we call the we call for an uh-huh we called for a fire truck to come and to tell us out and what you didn't notice this stuff is incredibly flammable so we both really burned because but luckily he stubbed out his cigarette on the side of the vehicle before he flicked it into the suspect while he was waiting if he hadn't done that we'd have died but anyway um so we waited and these really hunky firemen came and i was just cut i was completely brown i was just covered in this stuff it was so bad every time i took a step my my wellington boots were farting with just like all the stuff and it inside them it took three people to pull off my wellington boots and then i had to strip down to my underwear in front of everybody in freezing cold minus temperatures yeah um and they had to hose me down the firemen so i got hosed down by hunky firemen you think that's hot i then ended up in the back of the ambulance with two hot lady paramedics scrolling down completely naked and they had to wipe me with baby wipes because they didn't have any like anything else to help get me a little bit cleaner and i forgot to tell them that i had direct syndrome so i just turned and i looked over my shoulder and went would you like a fisting and she just did back like i have tourette's and she's like oh it's okay it's not the worst thing that people have said to me in the back of this van and i was like okay cool we're cool um so they drove me to the hospital and i they because i was naked and my clothes were ruined yeah tied it looked like i was going to a toga pie because they tied on these blankets so um um so i just cut a hole for my head in a little hospital blanket put it over me and tied it around the waist with some bandages yeah it made quite a nifty dress and um so i was wheeled in like that they wheeled me into this little cubicle that was basically just a massive ward with like a kernel and on the other side of the curtain there was this guy broke his arm and he's like you you know i was like no don't help me right now no no my first response was just i don't smell like one oh my god and then uh they gave me loads of antibiotics and sent me home and i survived but i brought my clothes and tried to wash them and it killed my washing machine jesus christ what a story i think it must have stink oh it was horrible it was it stayed so bad so so bad how did you like not throw up and [ __ ] i don't know i was just laughing the whole way through if i'm honest everyone was looking at me like how are you okay how are you laughing right now i'd be crying and i was just i don't know this is just the most ridiculous situation i've ever been in it just felt like a really weird life experience i already knew i'd been telling people about this for years i was just like holy [ __ ] of all the things to go through so it was just i just thought it was hilarious holy [ __ ] that that is the greatest poop story i've ever heard and i've heard lots of poop stories on my channel so basically need a deeply rust i still haven't jumped on the rust bandwagon yet have you i have yeah how was it i found out that the technician is not the best gamer no i'm not the best are you good at games it depends on what game um but i find it really hard to be good at them and talk to chat because i have adhd so like all of the best high scores i've ever gotten on games have been off stream like daddy why wasn't i streaming but the minute i stopped streaming i talked to them so much i'm not looking at what i'm doing anymore vice president shooters yeah so like i can't i can't game and stream it but at the same time but i have tits is that content this is content actually wait wait wait what is give my chat some tips on how to get girls okay don't be chat stop it um don't be yourselves guys don't just don't exist okay you don't have a chance so i i think one of the main things is that like pick your scene your setting well like when people are shopping or like going about their day or trying to get to work and you stop them and i'm like hello i like your butt and i wanted to know about the rest of you so i can convince you to let me have access to your butt that's how it sounds when you ask for a girl's number when they don't know you because they know that the only reason why you've taken an interest is because you've looked at them and that's not impressive so like it's it's not cool to know that someone's been probing on you and has decided to intervene and have feels entitled to your attention in time just because they like your butt that's not cool true so go to places where everyone's okay with potentially being hit on like clubs and bars and websites where you like you know dating websites and things like this go to settings where everyone it kind of expects to be on and you'll have a better chance of succeeding um and the whole treatment keeps from keen thing is a myth okay if you're mean to me if someone said to me you know i love fat girls you know you're sizing up and i just laughed and walked away like there are like people who say that you should neg women don't do that like being nice actually works honestly if you were really nice and they still didn't date you it wasn't because you're nice it was because you're undateable thank you preach it's because you're freaking out dateable chad for [ __ ] sake it's true it's a hundred percent true and it's not because okay that's wrong i know oh jesus okay okay okay no no no you guys are dateable no no you guys are a hundred percent dateable listen you guys are beautiful chad okay look at you look how cute you are i need to tell them they're cute ah there's no help for you um sorry no no no there is hope we should give them hope okay because you know if they have hope they'll give us bitties so yeah i think you've got the good strat there tell them they're pretty you guys are incredibly pretty and you guys have lots of hope and it's not because we want biddies so girly thank you so much for coming on today for reals ken can i keep in touch of course you can dm me anytime thank you miss leonida thank you this has been absolutely awesome let's play games sometime definitely yeah i'm actually going to rush today uh depends on when i'll let
