[Applause] well it snowed it's known since the last time I was here for sure law working up a sweat how you guys doing well thanks for joining me on episode 2 of a fort in the woods today we're gonna revamp this whole thing this is garbage this is nonsense I'll show you on the back we're gonna spend the night here as well - it's about noon we're gonna bushcraft all day we're gonna build all day and then we're gonna spend the night here I'm excited I've been away for two days from this this fort and I would just been itching to get back it's a good feeling check this out there's a bunch of deer prints all around right this is the tarp the deer prints right on the tarp they walked right on my old tarp sleeve here but look at this the hook he's good and even it is how much snow it got on to it and I knew that was gonna happen and the whole time at home I'm thinking I don't even want to tarp up there this is not what I want to be doing this is not the way I want to make my fort we're gonna make it the right way today we're gonna start on the right way today good thing this is a tough tarp there we go ice and snow [Applause] [Applause] my ears are getting numb oh that's much better Oh mu C hat well this is awesome before shout out again to trade coffee very much appreciated mmm okay so what I'm gonna do is start digging this down I need to dig back very far I don't want that cheapo garbage you lookin tarp shelter anymore it's not the way I want this to be I want wood I want I want steady on structure I want when it becomes snow and rain and ice fall that it doesn't matter it's not gonna sag and bow I want I want something very comfortable so we're gonna get rid of this bench throw it to the front for now I was gonna start a fire but there's no point right now I'm just gonna bust my butt work warm up that way here we go [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay I can tell that I'm gonna get warmed up pretty soon pretty quickly rather what I tell ya living the highlife peasant life over here boys and girls okay all this cuz I got a dig way back way back I gotta get out a couple things from my duffel bag here all I did was wrap oh I got a lantern I got a lantern thanks wrap it up it makes it dry I can use these tarps for tonight cuz I don't imagine I have my complete shelter I won't have the complete shelter built by tonight that's for sure that's okay I knew that coming in looking for my acts these duffel bags are pretty handy man I know I'll keep raving about them for the wintertime they're awesome okay cause you just find things so easily in them you know you have to spend time looking or searching or try to dig out you're just so quick snow anchors work really well I mentioned that before just kind of wrapped it on this one cuz it had a bunch of gnarly pieces hanging off of it worked well so you can probably tell you by watching it in sound hearing the way it sounds is that is acting completely different than the other day the other day it was warm and it was soft right very granular I was saying now it's like igloo building stuff like chunks no pretty solid too so it's a good and a bad it's it doesn't make such a mess and go everywhere I want to try scoop it but it's harder to chip through not much anyway I have a good idea for what I want to do I was gonna continue digging this out for a little bit I'll tell you guys all about it I'm almost done what I really want to do is hang a ridgepole up here and make like a half a frame shelter by that I mean have a full lean-to on one side and then come around and almost make a fully frame on the other side but stop halfway and make that into a doorway with a little awning and I'll be able to have a spot for a fire pit outside of it all a bed inside enough room to work a little bit that's my idea of a fort I can definitely put it in this space I think I might switch it up though I think I might use the snow to my advantage at first and build it up because I can't build the whole thing today so I'll use the snow to my advantage probably until the spring time and then I'll rebuild but yeah if I prop the logs if I make the logs long enough and prop them up I can do more of a slanted roof right now and then when it comes time for rain the snow will be gone I can pitch them higher you even put tarps on the outside I'm fine with that yeah I'll just cut them long then I can use them both times I like the idea that hopefully you can picture it all right I am pretty hungry time for lunch so been eating healthy still look at this this is like a carrot and like flax seed wrap okay it's orange oh really not bad no I've grown accustomed to it it's not bad at all so in there I I got that and then here I have my chicken and this chicken is just fried up with a little bit of like olive oil and salt on it not too much either and then I got my French's mustard but subscriber sent me a whole box of these a while back so thank you once again cuz I get enough of the Muhtar you know don't go on my fingers mustard mayo mustard 2 packs 2 packs old to pack their ego a little pink Himalayan salt we go on there pretty nice leave it it's alright I got my Apple crisps for after look at this it doesn't even break okay it's pretty pretty flexible which is amazing especially in this this weather Oh sounds like dog tags to ice on the trees anyways it's uh negative 15 or so at least it was I left my house Celsius alright haha Cheers it's not dry it's not dry at all okay so temps are supposed to get to negative 18 negative 20 luck tonight I got decent decent sleeping gear I brought the same sleeping bags I brought for that emergency shelter with bouche I got a negative 20 and a negative two together that combined that is very very warm here it it is ice on the trees making a clanking noise here well that's pretty cool it's like natural chimes the wind keeps picking up and when it does it gets cold man especially cuz I'm not do anything right now she do something you're got ripped on one of those trees coming through oh it's cold all right so I got a really hard dance piece of Deadwood here I believe it's white oak the thing is solid to some effort cutting through it I'm hoping it's long enough for my Ridge Pole my thinking is there's gonna be a lot of weight on this ridge Pole over the course of time by the time the shelter's worked on and stuff I don't want it bowing out I definitely don't want to live ridgepole because it will bow out and eventually break and I can't really find that dense of a dead balsam fir or whatever it's it's it's pretty marginal the wood that being said balsam fir is pretty light too so there's not much structure to it no much strength this will have a lot of strength to it I don't know if it's exactly long enough to throw on the ridge up for the ridgepole and that's what we have to find out now all right we shall see she's long enough definitely long enough perfect okay and that's actually not a bad height for at least right now yeah I keep that up there and lean logs long logs from the top of the snow up that's it I have a good amount of room back here locked in high enough and I'll have a good awning over myself it's not that much of an awning no big duck put a tarp if I want I think this is gonna work up pretty cool right now it is that's almost as high as I am first hauls I am and I can tie it a bit tighter I can talk I can tie it a touch taller say that 10 times fast and yeah I'll have plenty of room I can even tie it on the outside so this is the thing normally when you're tying a ridgepole I want to hide on the inside of the tree meaning where all the weight is coming down pushing down and then it's going to be braced against the tree whereas if this ridge pull is on the other side of the tree right everything's leaning on it and the only thing stopping is the the paracord that's holding it up but there wait there are ways to negate to this and especially with the shelter setup that I plan on doing lean back on the front and then straight almost straight up and down as I'm sorry on the back and then almost straight up and down in the front for half of it so really if I put this on the outside I'm gaining a ton of room back here right almost probably but a foot of room back towards where I want to sleep and hang out at and then I can prop up logs like this prop log underneath this log on the outside as my wall boom boom boom boom boom that's half my half wall and then that'll do two things it'll lock those stand up and down pieces in place and it will support this and I can also put supports all along the the outsides of it so I think that's what I'll do yep does that make sense I hope it makes sense it should make sense it makes sense to me I can almost really just wedge it in this cedar here that would be pretty cool if I could do that I can at least on the one side that makes life easy I'll still secure it but it makes it easy to tie up you will use black with this bird's nest undone there we go it's the best way no I told you yes it's the best way to store your paracord neatly very neatly considering the tree that I have to go around is pretty big I need a decent sized piece of paracord so let's just measure and make sure now plenty of room to around that and the ridgepole actually let's see that was pretty thick yeah pretty pleased with that so I'm gonna tie Canadian Jam it's the way to do it for this type of stuff in my opinion I have a knot at the end tie a knot close to that loosely and then you'll run your tail through that loose knot and it tightens everything up to it actually this is really acting weird it might have been almost burned at one point so it's really plasticky I'll do it on this end I just want to be able to manipulate it it's not it's pretty stiff oh all right cut the knot off the other side so it goes in easier [Applause] hey I need some tie some lashings on here as well I'm just there's one piece of paracord isn't gonna cut it [Applause] this is weak yep we will prop it up we'll get it going my hands and it's too cold anyway she's up there it's pretty even pretty even across so I got that much give or then watch extra at the end here which is helpful I'll leave that on there and then on this side it's got more than enough right look it only really needs to go to this tree here it's all the way touching three trees and propped up I don't really have to worry about that I will secure it like I said seeing what put this side I will wrap up a little bit better just to be secure it's on there but I don't I don't think I could give it the weight test yet all right we're gonna do some wraps and props with this longer piece just started off by tying it right to this other piece of paracord that's already on then wrenching it [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] alright time for the oil weight test if it can hold my weight it can hold anything and I haven't even tied it up on that side at all alright I'm pleased with that very happy with that now I have all of this as room covered protected room fire pit here it's all coming together sunk all right all right see if I can pull it up and over here oh man it's a lot more difficult than need to be timber I want to make sure that I'm cutting these the right size so I'm gonna try to measure with one of the old pieces from the bed see if that's long enough and then I can use it like a ruler on the on the trader sit down whew looks like this is the longest one okay said I do want a a bit of an overhang ah something I I do want a bit of an overhang that's a pretty good overhang as it is and it's back here far enough maybe a touch longer than this I just want to make sure because this isn't a full straight line back then it fits every single place and it does so this is light enough I can carry this until you get a feel for how long normally I'll cut a couple of sizes then be able to pieces that like to be able to eyeball it pretty closely so yeah let's go measure it up ideally I'll get three pieces out of this tree X huh okay well I did say it could be a for to be a touch longer but cut it maybe six inches longer yeah yeah yeah how about five four or five inches longer does that actually that one or two inches makes a huge all right so this is gonna be a theme it seems like I got this one cut off and same thing buries itself in the sill I even took a shovel dug it out a few times it's long probably two feet lengthwise I keep getting a little bit of room to go but it sinks again this heart so instead of fighting with it mess with my backup any more I could probably just measure it and cut it stick that measuring stick right down next to the end of it put it there it's not ideal but I can't keep fighting with every single piece like this is going to take forever oh hi strings man there we go before we go any further I gotta get rid of these they're just interfering getting caught on every single thing man that ice excuse me okay these are my new Marmot gloves well as I showed in my last video got from Moose Jaw they're leather on the palms it's like a nylon on the back say Gortat Mears gore-tex I don't know they say gore-tex but they got this tightener I don't know what part of this would be gore-tex maybe there's a nylon part because this sure does seem to be the leather we'll find out later on tonight when I touch my hot cooking pot with it see the effects they're kind of cool they're warm oh I get a drink water can't be too careful okay so I cut this big fat one shorter so then it can go in the front as a crop log I want to do that before anything else a bunch of logs already cut [Music] hey perfect I cut it a little bit on the long side because I can smash it down into the snow or dig down into the snow and prop it up like that I do have to go run over and grab my saw my axe cuz better cut this off this piece I would leave it on as part of like to Snug it in but it will impede my rafters my roof warmed up big time so this is a nice sturdy piece I'll put it probably about half way a little less than halfway through so that I know where to stop adding my front wall this is probably you know honestly a good spot oh that's cold okay mark my spot we'll try and dig down a bit oh yeah that's perfect don't go too deep because I don't want to be loose all right whoa buddy alrighty okay yeah she's actually they're pretty solid I will once there's weight coming down on top of it and I can actually even wash it to keep it sturdy but like that's pretty solid man I pull it was a little loose I pulled this back down and it locked in pretty good pretty happy with that pretty happy with the way that even looked okay cool man very cool getting somewhere the white tarp days are over very cool starting to ice up in the threads I'm getting hungry that's these gluten-free very low sugar kind bars I've been eating with good success a little bit of chocolate on there too actually [Applause] getting somewhere somewhere folks oh yeah buddy I looks sweet this is fun man this is just embodying the whole fort idea just be enjoying myself like a kid building a fort in the woods looks pretty sweet if I do say so myself all right the bane of my existence the thing I've spent so much time worrying about I got to cut that again [Laughter] okay this blade is no good actually this wood is dry somehow what's up this blade is no good anymore I've used it all up luckily from the other day I knew that was gonna happen I anticipated it I brought another blade so let's switch it oh just show you quickly how I do that since this is my base camp I brought a few extra things but I normally wouldn't really bring on an overnight or whatever just some things to make it more like home more comfortable but my lantern I brought some down booties for tonight just a few things but anyway so one that's my point one of those things was a multi-tool it was a multi-person multi-tool this is just a cheapy anyways it'll help me put the the new blade on so the way that this attaches are these little clips you can definitely pop them off with your fingers or your bill Knight but it's easier and protects the edge better if you just use something else a little screwdriver don't want to lose it though I don't wanna lose it it's in the sled somewhere when this little bolt comes out put it in the sled as well and then we gotta do the same to this side okay that's the old one you see see there's two holes on this side and one hole on this side I cut it in order to make it tighter so it can go on both holes if you don't cut the one the eggless saw is not big enough to have that extra hole out here and happy in here the pin be in that side I hope you understand what I mean anyways so I normally cut off the one side and make it tighter but let's see if it's tight enough without doing that first off well that sucks I did the whole thing without the camera running it was too loose I had to cut it so to put on the the second hole it wouldn't fit without cutting it I don't know if it's tight enough right now the way that that snaps down doesn't seem like it if not I'll have to cut this one too and put on the second hole we'll go see let's go test it out anyway whoa I'm sorry what though this is that nice hard [Laughter] it's no good I can see the blade flexing too much it's okay I'll give me a chance to show you what I actually meant so okay here we go again hands are too cold and it's too cold we just pop off the one side now make it much easier hey that's beneath my knees there oh two holes right if I put it on the second hole without cutting it it's not going to fit to bend it to collapse to close up for packing so take the snips right on the first middle the first hole good clip same thing and then just bend it a couple times there okay piece of metal go my backpack and we'll leave that laying around all right let's see now all this metal on my hands feels heavenly oh it's tight now BAM son let's check that out now the difference has got to be pretty substantial I'm sure on that so we're gonna call that good get some more wood and then got to start cutting firewood maybe set off a tarp for tonight how many on the back of that thing just for a little protection I seldom do it anymore but bringing a good multi-tool is not a bad idea on a camping trip okay I make these as flush as possible that way they sit flush with the next one not too much air gap can be kind of a thermal wall if I have the fire close enough plus it looks cool that's all right [Applause] okay well it's getting somewhere I'm gonna make my bed again I'm gonna set my bed back up I think now before it gets too enclosed here quarter after four now a couple more hours of light I keep having to take layers on and off that's the beauty of layers right that's the whole point what's the work man I need to melt some snow I'm almost out of my water was one of my pieces to my bed but it broke and I'm glad it broke now not in during the night hey go get a couple more because that one broke tuck them right against the snow at the back just a little upset right now but once I get more weight towards the front it'll even oh and if I do need to tie it I will but it's lifting on there it's gonna be sturdy anyways nobody I can tie it so I'll get maybe two more three more if they're smaller and I should actually pretty solid and I have as far as Headroom like a ton of room this he can be good going to be good okay that's gonna be the main mission right now is to get so she's keeping off their here is to get logs for this right now here's a secret mission in uncharted space five five saw its long Oh Oh buddy getting there so my bed all made but it's gonna be far enough away from the fire where I'm not gonna really feel too much heat off of it I can remedy this later on by building a bed all the way out to this pole if I wanted to you know mean that wide and then that way two people could fit on it as well I can sit at the very edge of the ridgepole still be covered and and feel the warmth from the fire but that will involve building the bed longer width ways and I don't want to do that right now for the bottom pieces so what I'm gonna do is tie up a chair I got Malcolm's the hidden woodsman's bush chair here so that'll be good I'll set it right here and you next to the fire for tonight just start off all I'm doing I have a fixed loop and I just run my cord through that get it caught on a bunch of sticks make it look impossible and there we go so now it's on there right now I'm just going to do some wraps and fraps this is the easiest and also very useful way to do it holds on very tightly so I'm going to come up in between just like when I was tying the rich pull and tighten them on top of each other like the the cordage gets tight tight onto itself and tightened up my tongue gets tied up some tension on it put some more spit on my name and do a couple more and that should be good enough I'll hold it my whole hundred pounds of joe sounds like a band a 90's band hundred pounds of joe I've got to adjust it but that's the gist of it the back has got to go back farther alright looks like that's the winner winner chicken dinner why would I say that that's such a weird thing to say that's where my chair will set okay I'll have to adjust it again [Applause] [Music] doesn't you need this third pole I can just really rest it in there but the problem is this stump that I left there is digging into my back and it's a little back for me yeah it'll be fine but this this stump is in my back yeah I'll just cut it down I guess this actually for the player there 5:30 I got some firewood no I don't know I had Tom from pretty cold actually all right tweaking this a little bit more that's my first stage so do you remember as we were walking in grab some birch bark it's been in my pocket drying out crumpling up a bit we're gonna spark that with a fire steel you got my big old fire still from HF survival school she's a beast she's got dolls get it all on there crisscross applesauce we're good to go well sun's gone down just got residual light now I want to get my gear out of my bag set it all up it's looking a lot more homely and lost Highway oh let's get on the face actually nice and warm the whole lot of crust actually the crust the ice apart we better to melt get more water per crusty icy part then snow Oh Oh Kerry yes well I was pretty good test for the gloves I do believe that they're leather marked him up but I didn't like burn through them or anything like that so we're gonna go with leather leather all right I got my water boiled I'm gonna pour it into my my water bottle hot water all right do that again but my firewood stacked up in somewhat of a neat pile I left some big ones accessible makes me feel a little bit better I'd like that snack and I'm like that I get a couple more pieces on that fire I haven't put episode 1 out yet I plan on putting that out in two days it's Wednesday today Friday will be the day and then hopefully have this one up next Friday as well maybe next Wednesday we'll see a couple videos in the queue right now or the old BDUs today ah have one of these in a long time vintage Joe I'm a fan of using a bivy in the winter put your head on the kerosene lantern go now even the bottom my student pad is somewhat protected from any would-be Hokies left over on the she'll rouille that's for sure whoa oh yeah that's nice that's nice and flat nice let the first one off some good eat no we're still gonna cut that stomp behind me I'm gonna set up my fire reflector I mean sorry my reflector oven and oh she's so cool and start cooking that steak up oh it's a little fishy losing my voice so it's a swan T Friedan it's from Sweden and I can never seem to put it together properly but my little grilling pair will call it good find a hot spot near fire and there I might even move it up there we'll see usually takes a lot of tweaking at least these for me when I do it yeah so bad throw some more wood on there Rocking other than that little tiny half of one of these sized steaks that I split with bouche maybe I don't know a week ago or whatever and when we do our trap two weeks ago I hadn't had one I hadn't had steak in over months we weigh over two months so I am still eating proper this little bit of steak should be alright for me again it is organic grass-fed type thing got it at a local abattoir and have it bla stand relatively warm all day actually it's like I said earlier layers on and off but that's what you do in the wintertime actually just rig up a little pot hanger I want to I want to make a nice one I want to make nice you know implements and comfortable stuff for here cuz I'll be keep coming back just tonight's not the night for that making a nice one I got my quinoa and even this a lot lately pretty bland but that's good for you [Applause] you know if that's the right way to do it you know honest with you I would cook this once my lovely super helpful wife has done it for me we shall see put in double the amount of quinoa our sorry W in water that I have quinoa in there I don't know they should have had boiling water at the time but that water's super hot anyways I just poured it into an algae and put it back in there just now alright put this back Thanks free and clear of the stump you want what stuff Oh Oh me that feels good I had to refill the water again maybe a bit high we'll see I'll check out this steak both of these are done do that looks quite good I'm gonna Stoke up the fire get my plate sit down strung up my little Scottish wool blanket on top of the bush chair to just give a little more insulation when I've got my sit down underneath my little bum bum we'll keep some warm keep seams worms oh look at the quinoa boy watch King while that little tiny bags fluffed up - this doesn't have like the bad carbs and starches I'm just talking oh my but I really don't know this is supposed to be better for me so eat it yeah I'm pretty good snack bland literally tastes like nothing [Music] oh man that's nice as a smoke ring on it whoa no salt no salt shoulda brought salt I brought down Moody's I didn't bring salt where my priorities tastes very good with no Sun no salt no nothing this is a third time I felt my Nalgene actually pretty recently too so getting a lot of water into me I'm sure I'll have to get up and be a million times that's right I'm going to throw the big piece of wood I have on here hopefully they'll all grow into a big fire while I'm collecting more wood so very smoky I'll leave that to warm up by the time I get back from cutting board hopefully if it has a burst into flames by then I'll be able to blow into the flames of my little sit pad and actually well that's going Oh that's already water never mind [Applause] this log I put here I know I said this before but this has been a key factor in this staying upright I'm not walking and trying to come up and down all the other places all the time it's right here and I don't even think I will build a little step in for that reason because it's very protective the way it is anyways I did get a good amount of wood anyway so I'm not one to last me now for sure I'm gonna take a load off and rest my back oh man it's very nice to sit here no no stars which is surprising it is pretty chilly well I think I'm gonna get my actually half of it already here I love the winter for just easy things like happy with the size of this thing - lots of improvements to come lots of changes and just continuous building on this thing I'm kind of excited to be able to change it in the spring again I don't know if you guys can notice or I can see it now in your head I'm gonna have a decider you can even leave this open for the doorway um a little bit farther here and leave this open I might leave this open for the doorway but on this side of the the big log I'll put almost straight up-and-down pieces but the thing is as long as they're underneath this overhang then it's good okay I can make them longer and I can tie them all in boom boom boom boom almost straight up and down and that way there's like you know I mean like lean to going backwards and on the front and straight down just giving us a full wall oh close in both sides and then you'll have justice opening here to come lay down sit there and like I said we can move the fire over over sideways this way on an issue and then build the bed out as far as these poles and and the tree goes you can get warmth from it that way a bit closer or have chairs like this one I plan on leaving that chair over here so yeah it's all in my head it's all coming together [Applause] [Applause] glass of Chagga I also have I'll be in chocolate whatever this little towel these little towel puck things you drop it in water for a second huh hot it turns into a little rag now this one obvious chug of tea all over it but that's okay fine Oh what I'm going to do just clean my hands and my face with the hot Oh hot rag well that was nice for a minute until it turned cold those are pretty handy I'll probably bring those on some canoe trips and stuff I got a whole bunch of subscribers sent me them a while ago okay piping hot pipe invite all right well it's almost bedtime - 948 I'm pretty chilled I got all my layers on everything living the life no boys and girls I got my Clif Bar that I warmed up over the fire oh I cannot wait to eat this thing my chaga tea mm Cheers no peasant life oh it's soft and warm oh my goodness little baked pastry a base stream oh that was a good idea every now and then old joke it's a good one all the white chocolate melting right on it's a white chocolate macadamia one macadamia nut one I swore I'd never eat another Clif Bar but you're hungry you're hungry I've eaten a million that's that's why Doug and I swore them off last algonquin trip it's about cookie so everything's good alarm not good in full I'm getting tired so I'm probably gonna turn it in real soon I don't think I'll make a hot water bottle for my feet tonight I don't think I'll need it yeah I'm good with you guys want some go into bed I'm getting used to winter I think [Applause] all right guys it was pretty chilly getting into bed here I filmed the whole big thing and then again it wasn't recording so this camera doesn't have a flip-out screen and my monitor is not really working the greatest in the cold so I have to get a better monitor for it but until then I have already messed up only two only two scenes this trip at least so get the hang of it but anyways it just - the thing is I have extra change of socks I took off my pants my coats down there as well I'm starting to warm up but my hands are numb touching this this camera and hold my flashlight touching everything so I tried to look at the thermometer I showed earlier to see what the temperature was and it still said the same exact temperature that it said midday with the full Sun own everything there's no way it's the same it's cold it's cold so I'm sure that temperatures bro thermometers broken but anyways I want to go to bed now I'm gonna tuck my little hands in here and try warm up you guys have a good night I think of me while you're laying in your warm bed beds with your duvets I will see you guys in the morning sweet dreams good night goodbye citations oh yes I'll be in to see you soon at 6:00 in the morning it's snowing quite a bit as you could probably tell why do I have my busy right at all it's not what's no it's it's very cold just powder if he got pretty cold and about an hour ago I had to go out and get my down booties from the underneath in that sled I got them on I got warmed up but so my hand is freezing touching that tripod right now I'm only in bed for a little bit longer start this fire up and get to get breakfast going the baby is good the baby is keeping me dry and warm my camera doesn't like however doesn't want to work properly I can't see through the viewfinder at all this morning Lucas said so quite a bit it's still snowing oh man I'll go get up I'm gonna coat what's this oh it's so cold so cold all right I can't touch this camera anymore man it's a good thing it's so cold because the snow would be wet otherwise it's just really just brushing right off it's not that big of a deal my hands are burnt from this camera okay hopefully you can hear me my microphone broken right off my camera I can't see through my viewfinder this cold is wreaking havoc on a lot of things my fingers included okay it's 8 o'clock like I said I'm up now [Applause] this fire created yeah my screens all messed up and my my lens is pretty iced up too anyways I'm just gonna get out of here I'm uh I'm really cold there's my camera is not working properly as you can see so I'm gonna pack up and get out of here I had a really fun time yesterday and last night it was a good time being out here and yeah I can't wait to come back I'm just freezing cold and my camera is not good so next time we will build more onto the shelter and keep it going wait down booties on all right guys thanks for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it I really had a good time I will see you soon good bye [Applause]
