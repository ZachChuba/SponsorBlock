welcome back to new rockstars I'm Erik Bosse in the third spider-man film is now coming a bit more into focus thanks to recent updates from the Morbius trailer and other updates from spider-man threes production thank God being a Marvel fan in between them Cu phases is like a dry an you arey that I never signed up for specifically thanks to some sinister six hints and Morbius and details about the spider-man 3 shooting locations we may be learning about a new villain Kraven the hunter one of the best Spidey villains who definitely deserves his do I'm gonna explain all the new details that point to Cravens introduction in this next film who this guy is why he's great and how he could tie into Marvel and Sony's game plan for their upcoming spider-man and spider-man related films boy the warning in case any my theories into being do right and ruin your life okay much of this speculation began with the recent Morbius trailer which hinted at crossovers with spider-man and vulture from the MCU since the Sony spider-verse and them see you shared this kind of weird neighborhood corner our reading of this is a set up of a future villain team-up in the upcoming third spider-man film in July 2021 so what do we know about that film well most likely it will deal with the fallout of the ending of Spiderman far from home in which Peter Parker is outed publicly and accused of murder thanks to mysterious post-mortem doctored video and Jay jonah Jameson's conspiracy news network an easter egg in the Morbius trailer confirmed this new dilemma with background graffiti calling spider-man a murderer also look out zodiac is back now I'm sure this is a different spider-man the Sam Raimi spider-man in the ps4 game loading artwork my perception is that the set designer wasn't too discerning over which Canon spider-man he was using but more importantly we just learned that the shooting locations for this third spider-man film will include Atlanta Los Angeles New York and Iceland those first three make some sense Atlanta's Pinewood Studios is the shooting location for most Marvel films New York is where they get a lot of the exteriors for Peters Queens home neighborhood LA is often the location for urban skylines all with less fuss in those New Yorkers that leaves Iceland as the mystery location of the for now Iceland is no stranger to film productions it served as a setting for movies like Batman Begins rogue one and Thor the dark world but one theory suggests that Iceland's grows and volcanic topography could be the ideal backdrop for Kraven hunter a game hunter known for globe-trotting in his pursuit of his big game or maybe Iceland could serve as the kinda Geographic doppelganger for Cravens homeland of Volgograd the Russia now sure you could just call this wish thinking by craving pans but the director John watts also mentioned Kraven as his ideal choice for a future villain and set photos from the morbius production have shown a catering truck with the name Kraven on it and yeah I got some thoughts on what this could mean but first some backstory on Kraven as a character he is sergej Kraven off big game hunter half-brother to this fight evil and the chameleon he gets commissioned to hunt the most dangerous game of all the ultimate trophy in his eyes spider-man Kraven is best known from the comic Cravens last hunt when a be darkest and most amazing storylines from that's expressvpn comm slash new rock stars okay back to Cravens last hunt in a story an older Craven plots one final hunt to redeem his lifetime of lost honor after so many losses he tracks down spider-man he poisoned darts him he shoots him and then buries spider-man and they he assumes spider-man's identity he masquerades his webslinger he saves MJ but he's like way too violent about it then two weeks later Peter crawls out of the grave and he fights Kraven but Kraven doesn't fight back because he believes he has already defeated at the Spider Man and considering his last hunt a success he returns home puts a rifle in his mouth and offs himself into an open casket hello because I guess Frank Castle isn't the only Marvel character to listen to Metallica but could any version of this work its way into the upcoming third spider-man film well last episode of rogue theory we actually went into a bunch of different sinister six lineups but here right now is my theory for how this could all come together so spider-man part from home left Peter Parker in a world of [ __ ] publicly branded as a psychotic abuser of Iron Man's tech and a murderer of the murdered hero Mysterio Quentin Beck whose team of operatives is still very much at large there's even some evidence to suggest Mysterio could still be alive when verifying Beck's death Peter stupidly didn't ask Edith is he dead he's real Becca is a trained actor gifted that gaslighting Peter with the timing of a professional sleight of hand magician and that it's likely Quentin Beck isn't even his name because sadly given his real name to Nick Fury's operation or even those girls working for fury his name probably what it popped up as a disgruntled former Stark employee and not the transdimensional warrior he claimed to be whatever is left of mysterious operation is clearly in coordination with J jonah Jameson's Daily Bugle net that's actually a real website you can visit right now to read about Jameson's paranoid ramblings including some relating to extraterrestrial conspiracies and those are pretty interesting to read when you consider that the Sony spider-verse included the character John Jameson the light foundation astronaut who was killed by the riot symbiote at the beginning of venom and canonically J jonah Jameson's son so just imagine this grieving father raging against the establishment that he blames for covering up his son's death blaming menaces like the spider-man and his Avenger buddies for exposing this planet to extraterrestrial threats like the one that took his boy enter Mysterio the devil who tricked the world into thinking he didn't exist who assembles a team of gifted criminals who were antagonized by spider-man we saw a brief team-up between Adrienne tombs culture and Mac Gargan scorpion in the homecoming post-credits scene and the Morbius trailer suggest that dog ass Alliance could be revisited and remember booking Woodbine's shocker is still at large perhaps he could bust him out now there was also some speculation that jarred Harris's character in Morbius might be Doc Ock but Harris recently debunked that theory however venom 2 will feature Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kasady with the symbiote offshoot attaching to this homicidal maniac to become carnage and after all these characters are set in place by Morbius and venom 2 and their post credits scenes later this year when spider-man 3 arrives in summer 2021 that would leave Mysterio vulture scorpion shocker and carnage as a team of villains who thanks to Jay jonah Jameson's fake news coverage the public champions as post Avengers anti heroes who love or hate him get the job done perhaps inspired by the Dark Avengers comics and to keep this facade they would need to kill off the one loose end who could expose them Peter Parker and that's where they need their sixth member so Jake Raven off wrestling reindeer in Iceland assigned a new trophy prize for one last hunt a bounty that he can hunt down by roaming the streets of New York in an inconspicuous catering truck boom got there okay who do you think should play Kraven the hunter in spider-man 3 and who do you want for your sinister six lineup comment down below and again watch last week's rogue theory for our draft pitches follow me on instagram and twitter at EI vas followed
