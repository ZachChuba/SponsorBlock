[Music] [Applause] this video is brought to you by skill share it might not have escaped your attention that the Nintendo switch celebrates this two year anniversary this month that's usually not something that I care to mention or Mark of any kind of specific video but I think the success of the switch two years down the road is very encouraging for any company with a suffering console Nintendo turn this around after the disappointment of the Wii U and now they've got this console that everyone wants to put their games on and replicate it seems like yesterday the pundits were calling time and in tenders involvement the console market and saying that they should focus on making games instead which is an intriguing thing to say really because it costs to attention the fact that even though the Wii U didn't sell that well it was still host to a ton of really fun and creative video games it shows that no matter how bad a console is you'll always be able to find a game somewhere in its library that was surprisingly good all things considered we tend to sleep on some of the famously bad consoles since we imagine that there's nothing to be gained from owning one but you know sometimes developers accidentally put a great video game on a console that doesn't repay the favor very well you'll be surprised too often this happens and if you're not surprised then this probably isn't the video for you the word underrated is used a little too often when it comes to talking about video games to my taste because everyone likes to pretend that they enjoy obscure video games that not a lot of people have played but the problem is it's on a sliding scale and it doesn't always apply though really good games that end up on bad consoles that kind of works because it's not a lot of people gave a [ __ ] about them when they came out and maybe less so now except me because I'm making this video I always give a [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] hey do you know why you don't see a lot more companies enter the console market anymore all tons of reasons and none of them have anything to do if soldier boy to find logic and basic copyright law to slap his name on to some cheap Chinese knockoff and claim it as his own much to the wrath of Nintendo and their big angry lawyers it's fine my boy soldier is over here diversifying his portfolio by using The Legend of Zelda theme and not knowing what work these are I reckon he'll be just fine but back to console because even with Soulja Boy getting things so spectacularly wrong I'm not sure if the people behind the Ouya did all that much better and they had a lot of money that wasn't theirs when it comes to Kickstarter disasters you might think of my turn number 9 but I ask Allah I think of the oh yeah this funky little micro console from 2013 that promised eight sheep upgradeable gaming experience unlike anything else on the market problem is you kind of need some exciting games before anybody starts to care about that in the end no one cared pretty sure there's Kickstarter backers that raised eight point five million dollars cared but apart from that cells of the EU was so bad that the assets were salt two years later - Razer and the console just continued to help recover some of the huge losses the Ouya occupied this weird space in the market that was partially covered by Android phones but the unique feature of customizing your console was never fully realized and very few developers flock to give the ilium much of a fighting chance by putting some interesting games on the system my favorite is just rain which is just rain Ning down the kind of transformative content that this console needed morale in truth that had tower for not a lot else but that's okay because tower 4 is this really fun multiplayer brawling party game that sets itself apart from other earlier launch titles by being kind of incredible creator Matt Thorson signed an exclusivity deal with Ilyas that tower for be tight at the console but once that deal ran out the game was ported and expanded across to every other console and finally towerfall could get the credit that it richly does deserves its like smash bros but two-dimensional and with arrows and I kind of love it there's no shame of refusing to go down the sinking ship [Music] [Applause] [Music] not sure if anyone's worked it out yet but me mentioning the WiiU at the start of this video is my way of telling you that I am NOT gonna be talking about it today in recent times the wii-u is active the go-to example of a failed console housing some pretty incredible video games since it's fresh and everyone's memories and Nintendo fans had to sit idly by as the competition was having a less shitty time the Wii U isn't exactly a highlight of Nintendo's history but I think he'd be stretching things a little far if you were to say that it's up there with some of Nintendo's biggest mistakes I don't know if you've heard but they've made some pretty huge blunders in the past like creating their competition and making an agreement to put some of their IPs on one of the worst consoles in history that's pretty bad the Philips CDI is a fascinating slice of the gaming timeline where a long-term deal between Philips Sony and Nintendo got torn up at the 11th hour and this strange piece of hardware was squeezed onto the market as a multimedia device that could play music as well as shitty video games except no one really cared to be fair the CDI cost $1,000 in 1992 which is nearly 18-hundred dollars in today's money and with CD technology moving forward at a commensurate especially when you consider that the Sony Playstation was just a few years away people not giving a [ __ ] makes a lot of sense but occasionally you find enough people who do care and when that happens you get something like burn cycle a game that takes full advantage of the CD ice hardware and has cutscenes in it the look pretty incredible really burn psych was a fairly standard point-and-click adventure title of its fair share of puzzles and shaky dialogue but I'm just a little amazed that you've got a game like this that someone put time and effort into on the same console as beautiful train wrecks like the CDI zelda games you know I'd love to see the parallel universe where these consoles with full motion video took off since games of this caliber are virtually extinct nowadays but damn if it had a cool thing to look at hey if you want that juicy cinematic gaming experience you're better off for burn cycle than most of the competition not if you want faces like these to look at all day there if you want to talk about expensive video game consoles that no one bought because people quite like holding onto money unless you can provide them with something that might be worth the investment the CDI is not as bad as things get with video game consoles actually it kind of is because you're not gonna find something out there that is charging you more than eighteen hundred dollars that is kind of ridiculous it didn't even have Ridge Racer on it what the [ __ ] that's the key distinction though the Philips CDI marketed itself as the must-have interactive entertainment box not just a games console it didn't work obviously but Philips charge so much because they believe that their little lump of plastic had so much more to offer the world than just a handful of terrible video games the 3do on the other hand was never designed to be anything other than a means of playing excited innovative games of the future and so retailed for a hefty six hundred and ninety nine dollars at launch this thing at a strange start alive since it was conceived by the same guy who founded Electronic Arts but manufacture for the console was shipped out to third parties who are better suited to handling mass production this made the 3do AI watering lis expensive in couple of its 1993 release coincided with a console market that was already straining under the weight of a lot of other mediocre bits of hardware and like the Philips CDI for example this thing didn't sell well the difference is that the 3do was a pretty robust piece of hardware capable of some very impressive graphical output that few other consoles could match plumbers don't wear ties look so realistic man the future is awesome it is but the 3do didn't last long enough to see much of it what it succeeded in doing was giving the world the best version of star control 2 of the 3do flexing it's relatively chunky hardware and CD technology I wanted to focus on console exclusives or at least games that started life as console exclusives but star control 2 is a similar story since the definitive version of the game was released on the 3do in 1994 with better graphics sound design and a ton of quality-of-life tweaks to make it an easier game to get to grips with now having this level of space exploration at your fingertips reminds me a lot of the elite games into a lesser more disappointing extent no man's sky but star control 2 implements all of these vert ripping over its own ambition and that is very impressive for 1994 what it was doing on a console that barely lasted three years and sold less than two million units I don't know that should have done a crossover plumbers don't wear ties because oh I don't understand these alien life-forms get yourself a console that can do both [Music] [Applause] Nintendo's insistence on reinventing the world is the best worst thing about them it's really awesome and helpful when it works and it does more often than not but Nintendo have been their own worst enemy on more than one occasion this desire to innovate above everything else has produced such priceless ideas as bolting a lump of plastic to the bottom of the n64 and sticking a finger in your Wii as well as all this cardboard that the world doesn't really know what to do with now ideas so mental that you wonder how Nintendo have any money to play with at this point in the mid 1990s Nintendo were one of the many tech companies who are experimenting with stereoscopic 3d but the big difference here is that Nintendo had a lot of money at this point and could happily pump some of it into turning this concept into a full-blown gaming console they were like mad scientists and they made that monster VR is a pretty big point of discussion in 2019 not just from the standpoint of what virtual reality can do for gaming and why Nintendo hasn't properly embraced it yet but also if we need it at all I'm sure we're gonna get to that point in time with virtual reality is just used as an extra means of immersion for a game but I'm worried about rushing into things a little too soon because famously in the past it's caused a few headaches ah literally as it turns out because the technology behind tendo's Virtual Boy wasn't as airtight as they would have hoped and instead of acting as a window into the of world of 3d video gaming it instead gave a ton of kids migraines and was in general very awkward to use and to mount on your head there were issues of motion sickness and dizziness and I remember there were a few reported cases of some kids donning the headset and being horrified but seeing a reminder that you've enjoyed this video and want to see more than be sure to click subscribe and hit that Bell for notifications of every new upload the other issue of the Virtual Boy is that Nintendo didn't do a ton to supportive of enticing video games with only 14 games making it over to North America one of these was Wario Land a relatively new site franchise Nintendo at a time when this character hadn't found his special niche with minigame compilations yru land for Virtual Boy is very strange because it doesn't even try to take advantage of the 3d gimmick and there's absolutely no reason why it needed to be on this console it's another really fun very solid 2d platformer from a period of time when intended were knocking it out of the park in this department and it amazes me to no end that we've never seen where are you Landry released if Nintendo wants to make the switches online genuinely worthwhile [ __ ] Wario Land I swear to you my farty boy deserves so much more than this [Music] [Applause] you so you might be wondering how I'm ranking these games and honestly I'm not so sure myself it's not like there's some perfect correlation between how badly a console fails in the quality of the games on it that leaves me with the perfectly imperfect storm to cap the end of this video with the worst console of all time is what the the atari jaguar AV this [ __ ] monstrosity that finished off one of the great pioneers of video games yeah probably verb were there any truly great games on it that are worth talking about probably I've really looked into all that much if just because I need some kind of segue so that I can talk about Panzer Dragoon soccer again at a time when PlayStation were flaunting that critically and commercially outstanding Final Fantasy 7 se guitar some of their poor developers to create an RPG that could somehow go toe-to-toe of Square Enix's magnum opus that's really hard and depending on who you ask and how much they idolize oversized swords an impossible task that no game has achieved since these people haven't played Panzer Dragoon saga because what's a corps achieved here against all odds is a masterful transcendent approach of the RPG genre that doesn't try to copy Final Fantasy sevens ideas but instead goes from more dynamic style of combat that always feels like an action RPG at times throw in some fully 3d graphics and voice acting and you've got a recipe for one of the best RPGs of all time that should've by all accounts earned Sega a ton of money why didn't it well timing Sagan needed a game to go up against Final Fantasy 7 because they were losing the console war hard the Sega Saturn wasn't selling well in the West and would continue to flop until it was discontinued after just three years of production Sega didn't help themselves by limiting third PI support and never releasing a mainline Sonic game for the console but they pinned a lot of their hopes on Panzer Dragoon saga in a desperate attempt to drag some of that market share over the Saturn this game came out in 1998 the same year that production of the Sega Saturn halted for Western markets and despite Panzer Dragoon saga cements quality it simply had too much to do in such a short space of time if the best game of all time came out tomorrow on the station veto would you buy it it's a hard sell under even the best of circumstances this rebel Luigi and the tragedy of Panzer Dragoon saga actually runs a little bit deeper than that because the previous games in this franchise were on rail shooters so in order to make an RPG the dev team were to start virtually from scratch and the fact they made such a high caliber of game in the end is a goddamn miracle imagine spending so much time on something creating something so amazing but getting such a such a small amount of financial reward at the end of it so I'm making a YouTube video in 2019 [Music] [Music]
