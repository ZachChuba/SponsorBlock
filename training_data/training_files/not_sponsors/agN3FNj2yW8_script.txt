sponsoring today's video so I'm going to be randomly selecting one patreon supporter every two weeks from now on to play a full life with me so before it was once a month but I think it's better if I

my team and I and be in some of my videos check out my patreon you can choose any tear support on my patreon to be entered into the random draw like patreon link is also down below and I want to say a big congratulations to the kernel 78 for winning this first patreon contest so big thank you to everyone who supported me in my last video I think it's an important topic to discuss sometimes about online gaming culture if you haven't seen it I'd suggest giving it a watch before viewing today's video all of your comments give me hope that we can always do better as a community of gamers so this video features just some bonus chill content from the wife many of you were wondering if I added burnt into the team and we did he's going to be playing future wipes with us from now on I hope you enjoyed today's video the following is vanilla rest [Music] much I call it since a new it's a whole box and then like another row I'm hike wall the whole LC cleanse off for search for this bird new brothers wonder what the pops could be like next week then it was pretty stable for a little while it's the Klan honestly yeah so yeah maybe people will come back it's like Hello it really seemed to care about it though is like yeah from when I talked to him outside like when I first met you guys he didn't seem to care be easier to just fly this [ __ ] like before all right well why don't we just go look for a boat we'll transfer [ __ ] from the tower first and then come back to this stuff yeah I got lots of my cloth yeah the other day someone was saying you were on the server bye-bye I really do okay yeah from LC no I'm when someone's just on the server it was gonna be because he was saying it oh it might have been gonna be no it's up top I mean you can bring this research they loathe you there these kids were still unorganized though not only were they unorganized like in loot boxes and stuff like that but like their maids and stuff like that yeah I consume it was chaos and it was I didn't really want to go on any raids with them because of how unorganized it was sometimes you gotta learn the hard way though yeah do you have a thousand francs I'll bring up two or three over yeah let's Scout fun it was put it up talking our business damn you just like sloppy right here and you're not even against the wall yeah they bad always show them it just space stuff wherever I guess boom here we'll get this and get a rib on the way wait a secured like that's [ __ ] lagging hard day hey what hey I don't want to look them they're nice guys they got raided by these house clean anyway so burnt are you able to find a mini copter on the roads I don't know how to fly oh [ __ ] haven't had the Fayette Norris Mentors wait I'm going the wrong way level 3 workbench casually sitting on the floor yo if you want to come out and bring loot we're here just said in the water at our nine who come with us soon you guys are good you guys are good we're not gonna kill you guys I just didn't know who you were man I didn't know who you were your bodies are here though you guys can do alright this is a friend is our friend he's good he's good right it's not easy he thought in LC anywhere did I'm not enough for today but yeah you guys have fun on the rig I'll get you guys some loot once we're done probably open the tower to them yeah yeah that's a nice shell our skin you got there great it is pretty cool isn't it I like it just casually drops his workbench three yeah we're in the snow by the way we're in like that's no cave we're right at some GTA okay and I was thinking either that cave or the one on in like E six when I found out you guys lived in a cave initially I didn't clue him but I figured since you lived in a cave you to be skinning some of the caves yeah service quiet now yeah but there's people logging yeah they really did kill the server pop yeah man when you think about it we did the server a favor if it's gonna continue with Fluer teams yeah hopefully listen to that I think there's more fuel on now than there was when they were on yeah I think so too this isn't something I hold very often okay yes okay I'm like the only one on the team that uses it yeah actually crimp and crimp it's not bad with its if Griffin joins us he does Gumby sucks with it so he does like mp5 or LR with bull he's really good with Boyle nine I'm good bullet aka flexor miss what are you good with spirit um lately I had been using LR yeah lr s cool only cuz it doesn't have much recoil and I haven't gotten used to the a K recoil again yet yeah it took me about a full month to learn it properly yeah yeah you got a drag down left and right until the full cup something yeah like left right three or four times you can't remember yeah I got the first one that's about it took me forever but when I cleared in it's [ __ ] beautiful I almost find it easier to using the SAR though which is strange the a K it's a bit more accurate do you mean for repeller I usually just push down like when I'm spamming sorry are you in high school Bert I know oh you're in college you chillin no I'm just chilling right now good I took like two years once I finished high school I took like two years off just like I don't know if you guys wanna got in cuz you guys used up all your rockets trying to find us right yeah they did okay give us a sec we got to change all these certificates groceries I think there was like what three and a half rows of sulfur to that they had down in the cave okay yeah just follow me let me get the rules yeah we couldn't find [ __ ] garage door to save her life only this would have been answered to raid yeah I mean she put the sheet metal bits all over what is that there it's a restaurant oh you don't have that no that's new to me that's kind of cool yeah there's another one is gonna consider that's the first time I'm saying it wait there's something under really no base design it's our first time ever building in the corner okay yeah you like my do you like my Tier three placement up there it's nice who usually organized this for you guys slide slide ninja he gets on really late though like it probably won't get on for another three hours he works usually up late anyways and I usually organize usually when it's organized we keep it organized but obviously right now it's good yeah you know kind of just around okay I'm ready to go back burnt and I should go find a Chomper so it's blue still pissed at you um I don't know honestly he'll probably sleep on it and like not give a [ __ ] yeah yeah we'll see you guys who weren't always farming sulfur noise around here is that dude this was our farm area we got so from like one jackhammer is incredible yeah this is where you guys from right yeah this is where we would usually farm jump I having a good time loudly and at this point we might as well just ran there yeah yeah I'll check out but like below with the LC base that's where I've been I found 3 I'm gonna keep looking if you want to go out yeah is there anything in the shop you have um there's an auto turret in there yep I did I changed that to more peaceful Oh feel bad for anyone who tries buying anything from the shop exactly dude okay I found one but I'm gonna scope out see if there's another one so you guys aren't the both I mean at least they made it so you can get out of there now I remember when there was no way out and it was just a death pit all right we got two now can you recycle grenade launchers I haven't tried that I don't think I've ever rich enough to try that whoa-ho but it's worth a shot you
