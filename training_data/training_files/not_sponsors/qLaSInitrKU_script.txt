but you everybody out here is here welcome back the long dark interloper series 1 episode number 4 so I'll be the first statement I made some mistakes um I completely missed a hacksaw was in the car Hydra damn it's under the stairs one of the eagle-eyed viewers left a comment and sure enough it was right there so here's the game plan rather than shoot off to the solution point like we were playing I'm gonna go ahead and pause it because every calorie counts interloper rather than shoot off the interloper up to a desolation point like we were playing it and hoping to find a hex all there if not just use the metal that we have to make the tools that we need to get by I am going to go up to the abandoned lookout hopefully there's one there if not then from there we'll head on over to to that ravine we're gonna take the rope with us the mountain rope we're gonna drop down in the ravine grab some items there at the bottom of the ravine come back up get that X off from the hydro dam and then go from there and probably go through winding river maybe find a there's a possible chance of finding a sleeping bag there so it might give that a shot that which will take us to pleasant valley which isn't too bad cuz pleasant valley is a good place to loot as well so we kind of make a loop come back through pleasant valley end up at the top of the hill come right back down to where we are now that might be two or three episodes worth of gameplay but that's the that's the plan hopefully we find a hacksaw up here at the lookout and then from here if we do find one up there to look out abandon lookout just just up the hills from us here we'll go over to desolation point hit the whaling facility and hopefully find a sleeping bag inside of there so that's the game plan alright also I should be keeping an eye on these even if they don't go bad they also said that granola bars candy bars and energy bars I've never given them food poisoning and I can't remember when they have given me food poisoning so I think I'm willing to eat those also some people were wondering why I was using cattails because a lot of times when I was sleeping I only needed like another hundred calories to get a full night's worth of calorie coverage for sleep and I didn't want to like smash open I can and lose like 25% of my calories from that can people are saying you know you should use Scott tennis is the last resort well in this case I don't have a can opener so I'm not getting the full calorie benefit and I don't want to lose those calories because to me that's that's a waste also though there are plenty of cattails to behead out there let's see here in let's going to get a drink and then we might take a look here see how things are going outside and it's almost dark might be worth going up there tonight as long as we can feels like 30 I think I think we might go for it let me just check my let me check my weight and all this stuff here I don't want to go running out here with a bunch of stuff I don't need which is clearly a case I'm gonna just leave this stuff on the floor here I'm just going to go through you're doing a little bit of quick inventory management drop one of those books probably don't need to be carrying the frontier shooters guide alright that looks pretty good got a little fire accelerant in case we need to have to get a fire going super fast we do have some first aid in a septic and we got some painkillers and some rest you tea or antibiotics in case we need that also some purification pills that's fine I'm happy with that let's see here two of these hoodies am i wearing everything that I can be wearing so you're decent ski jacket I think these hoodies aren't as good are they no and let's see here 20% and that is on the inner layer let's take that off someone saying yeah make sure you put your what most waterproof thing on the outside yeah I should be doing that honestly that is sort of my bed this will be where that um faint inner layer oh it's talking about inside my coat so I guess it doesn't really matter when they're just are in close to my body I was thinking I was up here for some reason okay let's see here yeah we'll work well we're that one okay but here we have five percent thirty percent on our layer this that's good and no extra pants that doesn't really matter no extra underwear that doesn't matter that doesn't matter there and I think we're does inner layer inner layer I don't think that really matters anyway I think you're both gonna get exposed to the to the wet or the snow or whatever all right there we go let's do some more yeah she's getting tired but I think we can make it up there beef jerky should not get you sick either from what I read drop a couple of those really don't need to be carrying all this stuff I probably you I'll probably eat this dog food should be pretty safe as long it's not below 40 somewhat comfortable about about it throw some of this stuff down that side what's the set 25 yeah I'm not comfortable with that but as long as it's there see I'm gonna keep these cans even if they go bad because uh it really should exit in a crouched position I'm gonna keep those cans even if they go bad cuz that they get down to 1% when I do get up to level 5 cooking I'll still be able to eat them without having to worry about food poisoning that looks good thing else looks pretty good probably don't need to be carrying all this around and it's fine no big deal that I switched condition should probably take the lower conditions with me but I think we're good we're down to 65 pounds I need to go grab that holy crap we got a lot of junk they're just stuck back in here now that we got rid of all of our food issues we're down here we don't need that many so it gets obviously I'll drop this one here full sewing kit probably don't need to recycle can if we're gonna carry that actually probably don't even need the cooking pot that's pretty heavy drop that leave that here for now I'll probably find more on the road anyway uh we think I'm gonna be using a heavy hammer no not until I come back here at least so we'll leave the heavy hammer here that's quite a bit of weight probably don't need the simple tools at this point and yeah that definitely does help with the weight where we do need to carry the scrap metal with us because we might not find a hacksaw and at least we can make ourselves some improvised edged tools the knife and the hatchet I don't need be carrying all that either another have antiseptic and I have a couple cups of reishi tea but I'm gonna go ahead and keep those in case I did get into a pinch you know me and my frickin weak legs though yeah that's basically all I got so okay let's try to make it to the top of the hill tonight again I exited standing up just bad habit all right let's try to make it up here we're try to make it all the way up I can go up that way part of me wants to try I want to go for it I'm gonna try go this way I don't know if it's possible or not looks like yeah there's a road going up here okay uh what do we got up here we got the bear yeah we got the bear okay well I know the Bears not gonna be over here this time so maybe we'll head over this way and we know that there's a trailer to stay and if we need to if worse comes to worse of course there are three bears on this map so my time I don't know if they all come out at the exact same time or how that works but anyway I got to tell you bad every time I start playing this everything every time I start playing this and start recording this I keep thinking myself man this definitely could be the last the last episode of this series there's a lot of I'm only going to give this out just in case not the only thing I have to defend myself at this point yeah if I don't find the hacks I'll hear we're going for coastal oh you know what I did want to go to the fishing hut first that's fine because I can't came out a safe way and then I can get out to that fishing hut and head over to yeah we'll just stay the night what we'll do is we'll stay the night at misanthropic and grab the rope from the fishing Hut back here for ravine there was a comas like man you really need to go down into her vein take that rope with you if you do head that way I don't know there might be a rope up in the up in the abandoned look look out I'm not sure I know that there is one back here in this fishing cut got a wolf over here a couple Wolf's make that three wolves at least okay do did this Hut or the one closer is it the closest thought I can't remember to this and throw make that four wolves now that's three wolves and a carcass is what that is three wolves in a carcass walk into a bar kind of too bad cuz it's pretty good traveling weather another thing I'm not sure if I mentioned it or not but yeah the comments are like uh yeah you're not gonna find line this an inter where you have to actually make it out of cured guts it will not spawn naturally in the game so which explains why I have not found any fishing tackle or at there's another bear so there's proof that you can have two bears on this map at the same time unless he's just faster than me and he doesn't have to dodge the Wolves he just kind of goes right through him so that could be the case but the Bears were out and about for sure all right looks like the weather is going to change anyway so maybe was good that we came this way first I think this is where the rope is there's another wolf right in front of us here toward coming our way a little bit there's the rope okay that's what we want - all right next question I think you know what since we know that it's safe to go back this way my just nap I'm gonna go for this because I don't want to dodge wolves in the in a snowstorm at the at the out there I know this is a nice safe place for the most part make sure I'm not stinky as far as I can tell I mean other than the fact that I probably haven't washed for at least over a week so far she's acting like she's cold really not the bed starting to get colder so oh please don't have baby Cubs in there getting between a mom and her Cubs I would not be good so yeah get in a bedroll will be a huge help as far as worry about cabin fever after day 10 my understanding is after day 10 that was disturbing after day 10 cabin fever goes into effect and you can start worrying you know you can start worrying about having to deal with that particular fliction no no no don't you uh starting out fires all right let's get inside creepy noises creepy noises it's just a house creaking but still freaking creepy mint okay so it's nighttime and yeah we're going to eat something here and then get some good rest probably whoo let's see what do I want to do i mend anything I don't really want to I really want to start a fire or anything like that just to read read some books I could but then I have to put some calories on board in order to read at least we have a nice bed sleeping Muslim take advantage of it it's like 55 and here with this nice 14 degree bed it's gonna be very comfortable night for us at least that's some emergency water there worse all right so now look at the rope we're a little bit overweight but I think we'll probably eat and drink our way out of that by morning so take a look here at our food situated situation here um probably just dog food first you're gonna lose about 25 percent of color so I think we get 400 out of it right we roll out a little bit lessen it oh we're getting more out of it than I expected okay okay down with it no so probably eat one of these need something more than a chocolate bar actually probably eat this probably be the next best thing to eat okay 35 close enough close enough and we're not gonna sleep for a full 10 hours anyway plus we don't need to recover that much condition Oh get a drink here there we go yeah go ahead holster that flare less we wake up to a bed ablaze and I think bleep for try sleep pretend we won't but we'll try well we know we're going will probably wake up fully rested before even 9 hours of sleep but let's do it hopefully we get good weather for tomorrow good traveling with her ok time is it it's almost morning time you might get a jump on it's probably gonna be pretty cold but we can stay in houses and as we move which is fun and let's see where we're at now now that we've drank and ate and drank I think we're gonna be fine yeah 64 pounds and then once we get over to coastal assuming we need to go there oh god that sucks look at that that was horrible ok so and how much to do can I do any purse yes yes we can definitely repair these and probably repair those I don't have any leather though okay so we'll repair these just in case these get destroyed we can throw these on let's do a repair on this another thing that's good is if you even if you're not gonna use any food in a can is make sure you cook it just so you can get the stats for cooking so you get a little bit of a practice cooking help you elevate those stats get to cooking level 5 as fast as possible but again I'm trying to avoid using cans like I just did last night specifically because I don't wanna lose those calories too dark to repairs I would have said yeah forgot about that alright it's a kill time not much else I can do unfortunately okay I probably can do it now if it's not it's still nasty and it looks like at least I could see the the mountain the silhouette of the mountains there from the background gave me rabbit ball I should eat these oh no I should not I most definitely should not could I eat those that have been all right so let's see if I can do a repair here well I'm standing here I don't know if it's light enough or not probably not oh it is okay I guess the sun's higher in the sky than the moon so that's probably what matters it's really that cold wonderful I didn't take long baths get gold at all right there all right we'll we'll go upstairs rest here are not rest but pastime here actually apparently takes less calories to pastime I'm 25 no sleeping is less calories okay anyway but we're just gonna pass time for an hour here do I want to do that though no actually do this I wanna I want to leave here with maximum dama okay there we go fully rested hopefully the weather looks better this time still curing til curing okay much better still cold so let's make it across the lake or warm up somewhere and rinse it repeat hopefully I can make it down here without getting numb numbed there's a wolf right there in front of us but that's okay we can we can skirt around him with maybe I don't see at any out in front of him so I'm gonna go behind him hopefully doesn't have a partner back here I'm gonna go behind him cuz I don't see any in this immediate area which means they're all probably in the freaking village but yeah she could see it didn't take us long to immediately start getting cold whatever smarter put the mittens on a wolf over here right in front of us kind of hard to see there is on the left side of screen do I see anybody else here near the carcass here not at the moment all right having some problems getting off the X here whether it's kind of nasty - all right I don't want to run I don't want to run and that was wrong about my hypothermia I kept saying 4% for some reason I don't know why say for said it's 20% per per hour in game hour so you lose 20% health so hypothermia are being cold it's like by far the worst they probably the safest way to go up here is up here and then get a idea of where the wolves are roaming around unfortunately this wind is blowing my scent tortes at the town that's not good wind direction does matter when it comes to the wolf smelling you now let's get inside cold it's cold I hire already taking a condition hit from that that little bit of exposure man that's rough alright right back where we started but we do have the rope now at least so I'm gonna lay down here get some more rest slow down our condition drop here let's go and sleep for one hour warm ourselves up at the same time two should wake up fully I think warm hopefully oh my god we're not even close to being fully four warmed up alright let's see what the temperature is now three degrees still oh it's cold that's the problem with leaving early in the morning as it tends to be still cold from the night before we'll sit here for an hour just a pastime might need to just make a move and go for it oh you're kidding me okay this is not this episode is not starting the way I hope it was that's typical of this game yeah oops I'll do that listen this is pastime again I I guess I could eat something just to just just do some studying let's do that let's just eat I can study much as I hate to do that all right let's see here what do I want to study did I drop here drop the runt you're shooting guy don't really need that one doesn't affect your boat deals starting starting fires yeah got to reach their set for let's do one hour see where we're at there we eat anything right now I don't think I'll make it another hour with the food that I have a probably to eat again take a look here there are 61 calories that's going to need it tried knock out two hours here unless I'm thirsty let me check my thirst now should be fun okay try knock out two hours of this horse there you go that was good still blizzard blizzardy out here I think now I'm just gonna rest I'm gonna sleep if I have to yeah I'm just going to sleep so I gotta make him sleep here dang it's almost the next day wow this is not how I really wanted it to go at all oh it's gotten worse did you hear that my only hope is sometimes when you walk outside it's a it completely just stops feels like 36 here in a protected area but she as soon as you stepped up from there that would be like negative high number okay but we're just gonna rest again pastime gonna let up right at dark that what are we at for today's anyway we're in like day seven there abouts Wow good god man okay okay this it's all over the place the winds going one way one second or one hour the next hour is gonna hold but four different direction the next hours it's like it's just going in circles over us here I'm gonna go ahead sleep might be traveling at night gonna be cold though but okay lit up what time is it god it is nighttime six days three hours and such 23° I'm going for it I got to make it to the next next slow don't have a pry bar yet all right let's try this again now that I have this rope alright well we know what there will be some places to sleep at least up here probably the trailer if I get into a bad bad state of affairs but right now it's 21 degrees it's not too hateful a lot better than it was all day say that much because they're all behind us all those wolves are behind us here okay watch this I think I can get up here Dona didn't I go up here before I think I leveled up here now I have no idea where the Bears are could be anywhere maybe not yeah I don't think I can okay never mind that's right oh I hate I hate walking through this area yeah quiet Cleary or whatever that gets called yeah got that sapling back there behind the rock said I can't get hit I'll have a hatchet or a hex aw that's a no-go there's a rope there do I dare climb it or no cuz there's another I think there's another level I have to climb and there's no rope for that so basically just screw yourself what I could do is go up and down that rope over and over again tire myself out for the night start fresh in the morning oh there's the bear coming towards me think he is aren't you gonna way he's going away okay now there was a wolf that liked to be over here too so is he going away yeah he's definitely walking away check us caper quick see if he's acquired any amazing loot nope nope we're gonna cut back here as soon as I can feels like there he's getting warmer out here okay oh I hate traveling these but I don't think I have a choice at this point you really good for a really bright night that'd be nice oh my gosh this makes me nervous fishtail when I just stop talking how nervous I am about whatever it is that I'm doing okay I was looking at the right side of screen here I will try to figure out that was what that was cuz a rock or something it's dark out here look for shelter I'm working on that Astrid I am working on that yeah that's what I was looking at right there is a rock right there okay make weep this is it over here I can't remember I don't think so well wait yes it is oh thank god okay I know okay well I thought was further now that's a huge limb right there all right astral just go for it inside oh my gosh I just uh it makes me nervous traveling up through there in the dark it's not the best weather weather could turn it anytime we're dealing with the cold got bears lurking around not where I had last seen him and such oh wow they've they've really made this place sparse would match this note from what left behind I'll let you guys read that if you want right there you go from Becker 47 83 all right got anything here for me oh no I guess probably in a morning but I don't want to yeah you know what I guess we could turn on the old lantern hold on it's like we might be going back to the campus or not to cable car to Hydra game unless I get lucky and find something here yes oh it was worth it oh my gosh guys I've never been so happy to see Axl oh thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you okay now what do we do well we could stay here for the night 48 in here now how we doing a fire supplies we should be pretty good we've got three of these cedar woods 30 sticks yeah I got lots of matches not really lots of but it certainly feels like right now and we can't break down the furniture now we want to but let's not go using our hex all up willy-nilly right now let's save that and I think unfortunately just have to kill some time here Oh how much time we got okay yeah we're just gonna have to kill time not much else I can do maybe I can do some repairs oh it's too dark to repair that's right uh can't really tear anything down the moment don't really want to get much colder either ourselves a nice little zero degree warmth bonus from the bed have really how's that a zero degree bed and that's cruel I'm gonna have to sleep bits and pieces tonight cuz this place could get really cold fast I might have to start a fire here that would be what would be required um wow that's awesome finding that hex all there Thanks oh thank you so much so I think I might what do I want to do do I wanna go PV or do I want to just go straight for desolation point I think we want to go straight for a desolation point and get our hatchet and stuff first and foremost Arabia will go to ravine go down a ravine come back up now we need we got a desolation point that way we get our hopefully we get a better roll over there somewhere so we're go there first so what I'll do is I will leave the Rope here for the time being we think do I want to do that no I probably won't take it to the edge of desolation point drop it right before I go to the connector and then when I come back I can grab it and then we can rest up and then go straight over to ravine using the lake using coastal highway while the frozen Bay and not have to use the switchbacks or anything like that and we all have to come all the way back up here and risk life and limb just to get the rope again so I think that's what we'll do so we'll just rest here we'll just get ourselves a little bit of your path some time here hopefully I think so I'll go again tango uniform keep an eye on this temp here Ok Go not quite ready to sleep at all honestly let's just keep passing time a little bit much as I hate doing this but this oh don't you start don't you start with this don't you there start it's gonna start doing a blizzard I know it I know it's gonna do blizzard just give me some good weather man give me some good travelling with that sort of calmed down a little bit still moderate amount of snow all right I think it's time to go ahead and eat and we're gonna eat all these peaches lose some of the calories in the process but we do get a little bit of hydration out of them actually pretty decent amount honestly okay and then we're gonna eat one of these doesn't really matter I don't know why I'm eatin so much prot shouldn't eat that much because I'm not gonna sleep that much yeah probably over killed it right there there we go all right so now we have that in a reason why I think I don't want to go to Pleasant Valley is because I might run into some well no I guess I have the hex on I could cut down limbs using that I was thinking I if I was passing the birch saplings and maple saplings I wouldn't have any way to get him but I actually do now though oh no I still think I want to go desolation point first but get that bedroom hopefully maybe in the processing plant so okay let's get some rest here for I don't know probably only got about four hours of sleep or something like that we'll try for five me oh you know what we're outside we probably just want to do I'll do three hours at first and then we'll check on the temperature again cuz I know it hasn't changed at all but I'm still a little bit iffy about these I've died in the look out before because of the temperature dropping I don't a reset will do three hours I'm gonna be like two to two whatever okay oh it's a nice morning it looks like oh that's beautiful alright let's go and get another two hours of sleep here and I think we're gonna wake up like pretty much fully rested don't feel like we've done what you're kidding me Oh what no it's foggy is really dude okay well I'm getting off this mountain I'm getting back down somewhere safer 14 degrees yeah let's get down and out of here getting down there's a lot more direct should I say alright I know where I could put my rope but I don't want to use it here ah that's where that's where I was looking at coming up but I couldn't make it up here I wanted to all right we're not gonna use that rope here mmm yeah wait let me think I go there I can't a mile edged up there I think I would be alleged up there right I can't get down from there okay we're just gonna basically go down around a little bit here the story's not yet written I'll get on it all right so one of them do is I'm gonna go back this way a little bit and then go pretty much straight down or maybe I'll get that sapling on the way back at their clearing mm-hmm it's tempting I think I will at that dear clear regardless I shouldn't be screwing around looking at Karen's I should be trying to get back quickly little Frieza I'm gonna have to just run it much as it sucks to do so all right let's slow it down just in case I need to run for real the nice thing about going down rather than up is at least you can sort of work your way down some hills you couldn't otherwise access on the way up so it sort of opens up some escape routes you will speaking of them I just see if I can get my way down this way oh well we have here got ourselves a sapling that's just a birch but that's okay we'll take it nonetheless first sapling just as we get hypothermia risk alright we might just actually I'm probably gonna go for the trailer and the blue trailer and yeah we need to warm up quick goodness gracious so so hungry pretty much good straight down from here I think Oh easy there easy there Esther we don't want to want to be doing that okay alright there we go oh yeah right okay I think I think I'm going to be right down here resting down here so let's uh if I can just rest for two hours sleep for two hours I should be alright let's check no I get a wolf coming at me I'm sort of s so there it is there's my there's my easy easy Astrid easy so you rather than use my rosehip a cup of tea just to make it these last few yards I'm just going to sleep here for two hours and it'll be I'll be recovered man interloper okay we made it alright Astrid you're gonna want to just lay down for a little while but I feel a little bit better a better situation at least so rest for two I think it's just two hours right oh four hours for recovery on this of course of this is it just recovery time is it rest or is it sleep I don't know I think maybe it's just rest well here's what we'll do do two hours of that and then hopefully we can sleep before if we need to we'll see what happens this is past two hours time see what happens hypothermia risk healed the most important thing and we'll see what's going on with this yeah we got plenty of daytime life so let's go ahead and sleep here I know I'm hungry but only one condition per hour oh I'm thirsty now shoot shoot shoot shoot and I can't interrupt it three percent per hour basically what just happened there it's alright and we got one more hour to rest so let's go and rest for an hour there and sleep for an hour then we should be healed up all this to conserve like one cup of rose hip tea there we go sprained ankle healed let's go check and see what it looks like outside yeah all right let's get going okay I think we got the bear cave up here don't we or did we already pass it nope this is the clearing okay we sort of came in behind it when we came down the hill and sprang her freaking ankle I think we had a sapling over here didn't what I think I'm here dear yeah okay thank God it was a deer was it her sapling here shy tripping out or was that my previous playthrough that might have been my previous playthrough that's too bad anything over here not really okay well oh well screw you YouTube you're messing with my head making me have to do multiple versions of the same series well let's get down here gets a little drink I don't have anything in here but now could I could go you know I think I'll go you go go missing throw up yeah I'll do what I did before oh there's a bear right in front of us walking away again big bear tracks he's a big boy big old black bear I would drink almost anything about now cuz we don't have water in the toilet up here so that's why I'm going for this one I'll have to start a fire and obviously I can't just start a fire for free because the clouds okay so let's try this again and I'm gonna drop the sapling over here we got a wolf over here little that's definitely a wolf yeah we'll just stay the night here then we'll jump off from here head for desolation point in the morning at least we found the heck saw well again some of you already found it once in the series me excluded and there's a bear walking out from escape it's like you can set your watch and worn by it goodness and another it's like instant replay like we went to the tape I just want that bear to get clear enough so I can get through I don't think that's gonna happen yeah I think you starting to I think that willful started to ping me I'm gonna get back in here at least I'm warming up a little bit no not really I'm just not freezing as fast I have anything here no empty Oh we'll take that we don't what those left behind in the container because then it will uh then they will uh hook my missile ish stuff because then when they hit zero they'll disappear but as long as they're outside of container they'll stick around this will turn around eventually I'll imagine it's like watching this fish that hang out with the sharks as they swim around they just like right next to him like these two have a symbiotic relationship going on or something he's gonna turn around here soon is this bears gonna roam he's gonna keep going for a while but this wolf will turn around eventually if not we'll just go around and up the other side of the hill here I might just do that at this rate okay let's just do that tired away he's actually catching up with this bears probably freak out come running us oh my god it's a bear I think I can maybe I can make it up this hill maybe I can't remember I remember I think we can well look at him he's looking chimp it like turn his head yeah I don't think I can I've got a bunch of deer over here they look friendly he's still going after that bear it looks like still following him do I see some saplings here's I just brush I guess brush there's another carrot over there I'm not gonna mess with it yeah it's not it's just just brush okay to to karyn's and the same that's so unoriginal spaced him out a little bit that wolf might start heading up the hill I don't know but she'd have enough energy by then feels like 22 she's actually a heatwave seems like at least in this episode alright let's just make a run for it final push up Dale to the water and we can eat some other rabbit that's outside so that's nice to sort of a plus okay oh yeah yeah it's upstairs anything yeah I definitely need to drink something right now and I'll have plenty for the night there we go all right holster that thing here I could go and read some of the book I could eat a little bit out here that's cold but I'm warm enough 21 degrees I probably get a chapter in I really don't need to eat that much which we got here 500 and 500 it's pretty good I'm gonna eat just a little bit here what it was 90% wasn't it it's raw I'm an idiot I'm such an idiot that's alright it's alright might as well just go ahead and eat the rest of it recovery time ten at ten okay so we need to drink one of our T's and then sleep for ten which what we're gonna do anyway so let's just go ahead and only problem is we're not gonna get any of our condition back so let's just go for it there we go yeah yeah yeah I'm an idiot I'm doing so good in this episode - right up until the very end let's really give ourselves some food alright hey should I just go to eat this might as well right yeah let's do it 800 calories go for I can't oh I got to eat it from in here let's go for it guys let's eat this right here 800 calories can't get any worse there we go alright there we go I should just run around trying to eat everything I can this raw go find another rabbit eat it raw just go just go crazy with it oh well it's okay we're gonna have some extra calories at least tomorrow after we get them you can puke at our guts out both ends aw so sad angry me we're gonna be out here so we're gonna need to be a little careful but we should be all right oh that's so silly I thought I cooked those but apparently I didn't dang I wish you would tell you like what is it it uh gives you a warning for when you're cooking to eat it right how's that work I think it does when you're cooking but right there just let me eat it straight away oh well well drink this up we'll do some studying get at least something out of this I'll do it outside so I don't get cabin fever well I guess it doesn't really matter right now but we'll do just one hour out here do one hour here not healthy enough ah too sick to study there's always an excuse they always have an excuse all right let's just go up here and relax we're almost we're almost ready for bed anyway I mean we're a little bit we're not quite tired enough yet but I think what we'll do is we'll just lay here relax best we can with food poison Oh here's the other thing I need to drink drink the tea there we go all right don't get food poisoning in while you're out on the road unless you have to make another tea there we go cover that now we just need to do 10 hours of recovery and I don't know if it's passing timer just hanging out I think it's just hanging out on this one because even though it has an hourglass just like the spray niggle I think this one actually gives you credit for just passing time maybe no no we'll see what happens here ah yeah I'm getting hurt real bad there it's actually making me worse I thought it just stayed where it was at but apparently not oh so it really fatigued me which is actually kind of good so let's sit here 1,300 calories let's get some water on board and then we'll just sleep for 10 we should be good so we didn't get any credit for that a bit No okay let's just sleep for 10 and we'll get a full 10 hours well we will be fine in the morning we'll just have a lot of condition to make up or I don't want to travel with that so we're gonna not do that we're gonna go recover fully before we go over to desolation well hell that was silly silly stupid mistake I shouldn't thought to myself why is it rabbit 500 calories because when you when you cook it there you go he'll do food poisoning as you can see our condition still sucks though alright so there we go well sounds like another blizzard outside though we have some calories on board at least 530 and we could still sleep a little bit more now that we've added some water so try to get like four hours of sleep there now you won't be too too hugely beneficial no unfortunately not but I would like to you know what I think we go for it I'm gonna go for distillation point I'll see you guys in the next
