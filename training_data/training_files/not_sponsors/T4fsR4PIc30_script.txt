yeah look at this it thinks that there's a stop sign just there okay very nice it's actually saying it will oh wow it is it actually is but jeepers welcome back everybody to tens of driver I hope you're doing very well today we're going to be testing auto pilot 2020 2012 in the rain in and around a UK city now this has been requested Lowe's to see if there's been any updates on how it handles wetness how it handles a wet road does it have a puddle zet cetera etc now in a video recently that actually showed the eyes of autopilot or what it really does see you'll see that it does actually get a basically a rating on how wet it thinks the road is and that can change depending on what road it is so we know that deep inside this system deep inside may be in shadow mode it can sense what water's here it can sense how much water's on the road and it can see actual puddles and I'm really intrigued now to see if it invades it or what it does you can see picking up the bins the lights and everything really well here and we're just going to go straight across this roundabout gonna bring it all the way down for it and of course it still can't do roundabouts yet so we're gonna have to pull it off for this one and do it ourselves again I think it's just the amount of turning that the wheel has to do for the roundabouts is currently it's too much for the regulations that are put in place the car just can't turn the round turn around the roundabout tight enough because of the stupid law so hopefully that will be obviously taken out within a new update but also hopefully maybe if brexit does happen and we do split apart who knows maybe we'll come out of the UN law that's pulling us down when it comes to autonomy I'm not sure if it'll be a good thing or if it will be a bad thing but we'll find out okay so we cut out some traffic works here and we'll see how nicely and smoothly the car slows down and breaks beforehand for us yeah really nicely as expected okay finally we've got a green light so we can get go in that was seriously the shortest traffic light time for green I've ever known so cones coming out now the car might freak out a little bit it could actually see them being moved around live there which was pretty cool but you can see we're gonna be quite lucky and we're just gonna flow down the road here pass the traffic pass all the cross roads actually showed there a traffic light even though the traffic light was turned off it did show it on there so that's quite interesting to see so I guess it's just looking for that shape it's not necessarily looking for it whether it's on or off it just wants to show the traffic lights okay let's bring this up to 40 then press the button and up it goes interesting enough as well in yesterday's video where we did like a vlog style video so many of you really enjoyed it so we're going to be doing our family vlogs again over on the Ryan family channel I'll link it down below in the description if you want to see more kind of family starve vlogs and stuff they'll go on there from now on I just had to put that up yesterday because I didn't want to go another day without having an also pilot video or a video about the tears they're on so yeah that's why I did that so I'm glad you guys enjoyed it and also thank you all for letting me know that by pressing the right stick upwards will actually disengage autopilot i weirdly completely forgot about that because I never use it that way I literally never use it that way but yet you can of course disengage oh god that did a hard break there for autopilot using that stick if you want to okay so there oh okay interesting it was kind of freaking out about the cars on the other side of the road there and I'm not 100% sure why but it was giving us a little warning as if we were going to be driving into them so we're going to be doing like the lap around here referred here I'm looking for any puddles I'm looking for any kind of deviation when there's puddles or how's it gonna react to that so that car came out but the Tesla wasn't worried about it the car front didn't break either so that worked really nicely every now and then there's a cyclist sign on the road but it's actually not showing it so there for example yeah and it didn't show it on the road I'm not sure why it's not picking those up but again that may be due to the water on the road so there for example that's nice and clear no it didn't pick it up but it definitely didn't put it on the road for us to see it's navigating this lot nicely it also did pick up a pile on there which is good to see I do like it when it picks up pylons because they are quite small and hard to notice we're going into a twenty here the car slowing down nicely behind the Skoda accelerating well afterwards a little bit delayed I would rather that be a little bit faster but it was a little bit delayed no problems here over the speed bumps it actually thinks of the speed bumps is an arrow on the screen which is quite cool and I'm sure at one point it's gonna actually have to slow down for the speed bump so I'm not sure how it's gonna judge that but at some point it will have to slow down for speed bumps will it go around this car yeah it did so it did break quite harsh for it initially but then it did find itself around the car which is good and now this road has no markings whatsoever so the car is gonna maybe go a little bit left to right across the road we'll see how it how it behaves here this minis pulled out a little bit but it doesn't seem to be too fussed by it and considering there's no lines this is actually doing really well sadly is going into even very obvious little potholes that I would like it to dodge but again that's maybe for a later way further in the future update pothole dodging yes that's gonna be really interesting to see what it can do that braking nicely for this corner you can see there I went down to 28 I was breaking a bit harder for it so it still did did do well it could have slowed itself down a little bit earlier but it's sorted it sorted out and now we're gonna hit some traffic so let's see how well it works this traffic again a really really tight corner here really tight left and the model three is doing this fantastically absolutely brilliant not great there though because it was about to go over the road and obviously there was a lorry coming so there the the lines on the road were very hard to read back onto autopilot here um looks like we're coming up to potentially some traffic lights and some roadworks so we'll see again how does the car navigate this is it gonna follow the cones or are we still gonna have to take over because it might be a little bit too complex looks like the lights are turning green for us and maybe it's just actually we can't turn right here I think so the cones are going to keep us in our lane yeah it should flow through this nicely it did go yellow Bob so you went through on yellow so that's all good and as you can see this is doing this really well picking up pretty much everything it'd be interesting actually to come along the other side of the roads and give it a go because I actually can see there's some cones just like pushed out by the winds I'd be oh this would be really intriguing maybe I can come back this way no it's definitely not gonna do that bit I'm not sure it'll be an interesting test to say the least I've turned around and we're going to be trying to get to this we're trying to get through this the other way but we're currently not being allowed through so I'm just gonna have to kind of cross over myself yeah there's no way that the car the autopilot system would allow it would have been allowed to do this oh it's actually saying it will oh wow it is it actually is but jeepers it went close to that cone it's still doing it yeah it's not following the codes that's for sure it's definitely following the lines which I think confused it a little bit because it kind of it actually started doing it pretty well and then it just got way too close to that one code so yeah coming back the other way definitely didn't work coming up some lights here the car is gonna stop luckily behind this Citroen Bob's the wouldn't have stopped by itself just yet but it can clearly see that there are three lights showing red which is correct except this one actually so this lights let me find this one for you this light all the way over here is actually the no walk sign you can see it changed there that was actually the no walk sign that it was picking up so again that's something that is going to need to figure out that it can't follow the no walk signs obviously and we're gonna stay in our lane here again sadly it won't indicate and it won't change lanes for us just yet on these roads that again hopefully will be coming soon in another update it actually funny enough back in version 9 we're talking a year or two ago at this point it actually used to do these roads and it used to navigate across the lanes on these roads for us so that's more of a new thing that it's not able to do it okay so it wants to attempt this roundabout but I'm not gonna let it because we've got cars beside us and everything so we'll do the roundabout ourselves I've got a taxi so close up my ass he's coming out my mouth it is unreal how close this taxi is I think it's because this guy's going so slow to be fair okay right back onto autopilot we're gonna put it back up to the speed limit of 30 and we'll let it do its thing I wish this showed you that the taxi like it can show you it's behind me but seriously it's like there it is literally like there okay the lines here do disappear slightly so I'm intrigued to see how the car deals with it absolutely flawless no problem at all there and again it's proving itself really really well through these kind of roads as long as they're land well and their own cars parks on the side of them and all that it's it's doing really nicely and the rain hasn't been any sort of differentiating factor at all I've not noticed any sort of change in the car because of it let's see if it comes to a nice slow break here it's a little bit faster than I would want it to there we go brake nicely so coming up here is gonna be a test for it because the lanes do kind of split apart and go separate ways so I'm intrigued to see which lane the car here can see in which lane it picks you can see all the pylons is picking up in the middle of the road which is really good and it's going up slowly behind them is it gonna follow them or is it gonna try and cut around them I'm not 100% sure it's all I was trying to actually go into the the middle lane or like this kind of right lane which is to go forward as well but if you go down that lane you're a bit over you have to push in at the end basically so it's not it's not a favorable lane but that's fine it's not meant to do these areas yet so that's not too bad you can see again picking up all the arrows nicely on the roads following the traffic nicely doing all the important bits very very well really actually really quite impressed with how nice this drive has been on autopilot there's not been any hard me to tests there's not been anything that's really cocked up except for going slightly wide at that one corner but still that's way better than it used to do because previously it would just fly out the corner and hope that you took it off autopilot we're at least now it does it itself let's actually put some er on the navigation as well let's go to the charge master why not and let's see if it sticks will it stick to the left here no like it is looking to actually go round here oh oh it's not sure it's stuck behind this it's stuck behind the van in the end and it did follow the bus stop but you saw there that's pretty cool you can see the guy walking beside us really nicely but you saw there how it was so undecisive of which side it should go that's how quickly it's changing its mind on its direction and stuff so quite impressed to see it do that and it has picked the correct lane for us which is good weirdly though it's put a stop there and the stop is definitely not there so we're gonna be going left down here following this van is the car gonna follow it no actually it weirdly went for like a break there to try and almost slow me down and go left that was a little bit strange I'm not sure what it reacted to but it kind of felt like it would slow me down to go down this way don't forget if you have anything you want to see from autopilot where there is something stupid fun smart whatever it is let me know in the comment section I'm gonna try and do as many of the comments as many of the questions as I can because at the end of the day that's what you guys want to see so I'm gonna try and make videos exactly on what you want to see those are Bhalla there on the right and it only picked up a couple of them that see is it gonna follow the forward or is it gonna take the left lane it's followed the forward and it's taken the right lane yeah it has in fact taking the right lane here which is good I'd rather be in this right lane than the first lane if I'm being honest but it was a little bit zigzags and you can see there's actually a backward facing arrow apparently on our road there's definitely not so that's that's an interesting one that it thinks it's picked up so here it needs to go left to get into our left lane but it's it has decided to go left at the end but it was getting a little bit close there as you saw no problem there through the junction which sometimes it does wobble that because again the lines do disappear very slightly and how's it going to fare with this tight rows with lorries either side of us hopefully no problems at all yeah it's doing this all really nicely keeping us nicely in Lane sometimes there has got a little bit wobbly before but as you can see no problems coming in nicely as well breaking behind this forward nicely and coming to a stop but actually whoa okay it did a little bit of a well that was a little bit weird bunnyhop I don't know if you actually heard that from the brake pedal but it did a little bit of like a it wasn't 100% sure I think if it was to stop here or maybe just after the lorry this is also where I get quite nervy as when we're on autopilot and there are lorries right next to us because it can get a little bit touchy on these kind of areas sometimes so I'm hoping that the lorries go first in front yeah they've gone their way gone and let's see what the model three wants to do here you know what I think that was taking me way too close to the right-hand kerb and I decided to take it off because I think it was actually gonna curb us again there we go put it back onto autopilot here keeping it nice in this second lane is it picking up all the pylons yes it is that's so cool to see picked up all the pylons there that's what no problems going back on this dual carriageway so this time we're going to go through the centre and we're gonna see if that brings up more issues than we've had before again bring us down nicely nice and slow and I stand behind this focus it's not showing a full line of traffic or anything it definitely I think the visualizations having some problems on determining whether it's like a car or a lorry or a 4x4 etc etc and that sometimes does make the car wiggle and wobble about a little bit is it going to keep the left lane yeah it has kept us to the left lane which is really good because the lanes here kind of fork off and they do split into separate lanes so the car almost 50/50 is it we've got no currently we've got nothing on here to tell the car which way to go either so let's actually let's put somewhere on for the car to go shall we so we can see it follow let's go I think we're heading back this way so I'm gonna put that on there which things are gonna pick is it gonna pick the right lane or is it gonna pick the left lane it's not sure it's picked the left lane yeah it's definitely picking the left lane that worked out well we the left lane works nicely for us as well so we're happy with that and here it is ah so you saw what it tried to do there so as I said it's slightly fogs even though the lanes are lanes it very very slightly Forks there and the car was actually trying to go into the lane that the Honda Civic on our right was in and I think it was gonna nudge in if I'm being totally honest I think it was gonna nudge into that lane so I had to pull it off for our own safety so we'll put it back on here as we enter this 20 and bring it back down yeah we're back down to 20 anyway Oh going slightly in the middle yeah okay going back across I wasn't sure if it knew that was two lanes there but it has kept into this left lane so it's got to be careful on those kind of I guess merging into other lanes and stuff it needs to make sure that it can go across into those lanes picking up the lights nicely picking up the pylons as well which is cool to see and keeping us in this left lane as we come out the 20 we can tap the 32 bring us up to the speed limit and actually it's bring us a little bit faster than I wanted to so here for example is another interesting situation or an interesting scenario that I'm intrigued to see how the car deals with it's a left only turn or it didn't want us to go past okay is going past the lorry now but it's a left turn here for us and I was intrigued to see if the lights we're gonna show like a different light instrument cluster but actually didn't in the end so we'll just keep it how it is back onto autopilot here which lanes are going to pick it's picked the left lane which is the one I wanted to wanted it to be on which is good and nicely behind this Ford Focus here back into the lane so it's doing pretty well again don't forget guys it is really not meant and ready for city driving yet so as this keeps on continuing to get better the improvements are gonna be humongous like absolutely humongous but it's doing this really nicely if it can keep to the center lane here if it can follow this Ford Focus that'd be great for focus breaking hard and our car has brake hard as well that was really really good so this gap is slightly too big for me but even if I put my car on one it won't go close enough and all the thing is if I put my accelerator down it will get closer but as soon as I try and ease my foot off the accelerator it breaks so hard that it feels unnatural oh it didn't they've updated it it always used to brake so so hard if you're on autopilot and you started to creep to a car in front of you because obviously it fought oh you might crash so used to brake close but now it doesn't seem to brake loads it does think there's a stop sign there yeah look at this it thinks that there's a stop sign just there and I don't there's literally nothing there I don't know what it thinks is a stop sign what does it think is a stop sign guys there's there's absolutely nothing there I think it thinks the pole of the lamp is the pole and then it thinks the red light is oh no actually I think it thinks the red light again of the know walking sign is that stop sign I'm not 100% sure but it is interesting to see that it's picking up some anomalies that we haven't seen before it's really like it's tucked behind that light as well isn't it okay so let's see how well they change though you can see that will it disappear when the lights change no it didn't disappear when the lights changed and as we go across it is asking us to apply force because all the lanes and lines disappear I think it worried slightly they again followed itself nice good confidence for these areas picking up the lights nicely as well and interestingly enough as well you just saw that car drive through a load of bins and there weren't any bins there but it drove through a load of bins apparently so I think we might be picking up some things that aren't there and that might be because of the rain I think that's what we're seeing here po picking up cones and pylons kind of not sure which one it is but it just puts one of them up which is good better than none I guess again as we come up here to this roundabout if we didn't have this forward in front of us it wouldn't slow itself down but it has thrown itself down in fact it's going straight across the roundabout why not there's no one there there's no one at this roundabout will it go straight across it yes it did look at that we've gone across two little roundabouts with no problems so here there's a big puddle on the left yeah the car definitely isn't trying to dodge these puddles it's not trying to react differently to whether the surface is wet or not which is a shame I thought it was going to but it doesn't seem to be you also back there there was a Phantom stop line again so that's strange to see so I feel I still think you need to be slightly more vigilant when you're in the rain you actually it needs to be really vigilant all the time but you need to be even more vigilant using autopilot in the rain because it does sometime pick up some anomalies which means it will also sometimes miss lanes lines and certain things but overall really good and we've done a lap of the city here and we've not had any major issues just the issues that we expected to come across you know what let's finish this video by trying to park the car and seeing if there's been any update to the parking system the auto park or the parking feature that the car has so we're going to go into this car park here and if we're lucky we should be able to park next to a car so we're gonna try and park either in between this BMW and the Skoda all the Mitsubishi whichever one comes up first we'll jump into there we go one of them's come up so let's press that I'm just going to look around make sure there's no humans no dog OHS no one around and how quickly does it park now previously it used to take about a minute to park which in my opinion is a little bit slow but as long as it does it perfectly I don't really mind as of yet okay very nice and this is a fairly tight gap you can see that the cars are close to the lines but our lines here in the UK are very very short and very small I've got to say this has done it really well let's see if it'll tuck it all the way up at the back as well a little bit of a change there and stop yeah look at that that was really good I mean again it was pretty slow but it's right in the middle and it's parked us really really well I hope you enjoyed today's video everybody it's a bit wet bit rainy and that was the perfect opportunity to test also pilot in these kind of normal daily conditions let me pressure but thank you to all of our new patrons that's all next time don't forget drive safe
