so I'm in my 2018 Model S my P 100 deal with ludicrous mode my wife's and P 108 and yeah I'm gonna enable it right now and you can see like it's gonna go up to the speed limit which is 40 miles per hour right here this place keeps the hands of your hands on the wheel which is always very important we had two discussion yesterday actually about that so coming up to the stop sign now it can't actually like turn at the moment go ahead it's actually not gonna turn for me actually I think it did turn no it's in sir I feel like Gregg Western right there I'm sorry guy there we go okay and enable it so I'm in regular autopilot now and see the traffic lights coming up right now I want to actually get to the front of the traffic light so I can show you guys that it's stopping it did stop at the stop sign but also neck be nice to see at the traffic light now it does give me a message saying that it's gonna be stopping in 50 feet for the stop sign which was nice and it looks like the stoplights and the everything is really bright on the screen which is really cool so I'm gonna go ahead and accelerate a little bit just so it can get going this is also new for the car to be able to do this is just incredible so I got a message here saying it's the traffic light is coming up and it's gonna be stopping at 400 feet 300 feet 200 feet doing anything for Sabbath there is a car in front so you know doesn't really mean anything so one of the things that people need to remember is this is beta software so it's not like it's gonna be perfect and it's really new so our job is just to basically monitor it and make sure that it is doing the right thing and if it isn't definitely take over intervene and then the car will will know that it's doing something wrong okay this is gonna be good test because like we're at the front of the light let's see if it's gonna stop for us right now slowing down this is looking good okay instead of stopping that was actually a really nice stop it wasn't too early wasn't too late so I'm gonna step on the accelerator again and let it go so let's see okay perfect now in the Model S the thing I wish that you could see is like the white flashing light if it went all the way around because at the moment when my steering wheels is in the position that I like it covers that top part of it the display so I don't actually see it flashing even though I have my hands on the wheel it's I'm not putting pressure on it so you have to either put a little bit of pressure or adjust one of these steering controls and then there we go one day though my car will drive by itself on this road [Music]
