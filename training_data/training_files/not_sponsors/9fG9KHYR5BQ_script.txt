we all know the popular groups that came from reality of survival shows but do you remember promise nine of course you do create it from the survival show idol school with hits like DK DK love bomb and fun promise lines up there with popular girl groups at the moment then why talk about them well promise line actually hasn't had to come back in a year and the reason behind that is quite unusual their story is very interesting if you actually dig into it so today we're gonna go over that the members the train wreck that was Idol school and where are they now but before looking forward I was like to look back before we get started only 14% a new what happened video every single Friday let's go back to 2017 in the heyday of the produce 101 series m-net thought they should create a different type of reality show one where 41 female contestants not only competed in the school but also lived together in the dorms for the next 11 weeks the contestants were recruited by producers they were looking for some trainees that aren't in a company at the moment or former trainees or former idols that debuted in auto school the contestants would not only compete with performances but also learn about the history of kpop and how to become an idol with votes at the end of every episode determining the contestants grades in the end only nine would get to Nebu and those nine were QT in 9th place a talented trainee with tons of musical instruments gij√≥n in eighth place in on-and-off aspiring kpop idol who auditioned for woolum entertainment but did it become a trainee more known for her modeling on fashion websites so jana seventh place now so Yin unlike a lot of contestants had a long trainee time and none other than YG Entertainment training in the infamous pre-debut group future 21 for nearly eight years Ji Won has 6 place a former JYP trainee for 3 years and a contestant on 16 the show that created twice not killing at fifth place a trainee of two years who studied in China and learned to speak Mandarin Taeyang at 4th place along with Ji Won was another jyp entertainment trainee say it home at 3rd place a trainee for for years whose biggest experience is in dramas and commercials hye-young as second a composer and songwriter with experiences and participating in hip hop dance competitions Angie's son in the first place spot the member with the least amount of training time with only 9 months these were ordinary girls now yes some of them were experienced trainees but not already debuted idols like on the produced 101 series and it was all determined by the votes of the viewers or so we thought again we'll get to know how I know school was right from the beginning and the horrible conditions for the contestants later and so this group was ready to debut with fans coming up with the name promise 9 meaning from Idol school and promise in Korean also that promise was to become the best girl group they took the first step by performing at the m-net Asian Music Awards in 2017 in Japan with a pre debut release class shoes imagining the first stage you get to perform on is mama where all of Asia and even the world is watching but they have a bit like professionals then finally promised 9 would get to debut in January of 2018 they began to fulfill that promise to become the best girl group the girls introduce themselves with to heart a graduation theme song to celebrate the group's graduation from Idol school and now ready to take on kpop as idols now let's get a little more business to understand how promise 9 would be managed let's break it down instead of a temporary group with a 1 or 5 year contract like I why or eyes one promise 9 was created to be a permanent group like any other k-pop group first managed by Pledis entertainment then m-net and CJ am created the label off the record both eyes 1 and promise 9 was placed under that new label so in a way these two girl groups are linked which could explain why promise 9 hasn't gone to come back in a while and we'll get to that but their first mini album would go on to sell a modest 7,000 copies ultimately selling 20k by today's date and debut at number 4 on the guy on chart this was a very solid showing for the potential promise 9 sadly fans of promise 9 were only able to enjoy a nine member group for a couple of months before member Tod entered the new season of the produced series produced 48 in May of 2018 as a way to probably bolster the popularity of promise 9 since they were still a rookie group and even on produced 48 QT achieved a lot making it to the third elimination and finishing 25th out of 101 not too bad if you ask me and I'm probably the worst person asked cuz I'm happy with the B - now while Korea was participating in produced 48 the rest of the girls were gearing up for a great comeback making everyone's hearts go Dugan Dugan Dugan turgon promise nine drop the title track DK DK attacking people's hearts when they watched it and what what the hell that's a big-ass cat that's probably the scariest thing I've seen in my life Oh anyways back to the song it was just plain fun with the repetitive chorus that sticks in your brain like some dark cute magic the two day album with DK DK as the title performed as well as their debut hitting number four on the guy on chart and selling 20,000 albums by 2020 slowly promise 9 was building off of not only their following from idol school but produced 48 as goodie returned to the group and promise became a full lineup again also in the summer when kcon was announcing their artists lineup promised 9 was named to perform a fantastic opportunity to put on a show for fans in LA in America and Thailand I was actually there in LA and I didn't really care for promise until I saw DK DK live and then I looked a little bit like this guy up until now promis has been steadily rising in kpop sales were consistent and the songs released were cute and enjoyable but there was that spark yet to be lit promise and I was about to blow up with their new release literally this was love bomb you probably heard it in 2018 as it was promised nines breakout moment at kpop the song was addicting and had high energy and was playful compared to their previous songs love bomb was a change in style and the first time we've seen this side of promise 9 also this song came at a time when newer groups were all getting their breakthroughs in creating some song of the year tracks in 2018 we seen along with love bomb boom boom by MoMA LAN shine by Pentagon and love scenario by Ikon what do all of these have in common besides being straight bas that would be future k-pop classics all of these songs brought their groups to a new level of popularity in my opinion 2018 had some of the best songs we've seen from different groups in a long time all in one year love bomb improved not only sales by over 10,000 copies but also helped promise 9 debut on the melon charts top 100 and peaked at number 3 young guy on it also got a bit of traction internationally on the iTunes charts 2018 was a huge growing year for promise 9 so as everyone rang in the New Year of 2019 you can only imagine promised 9s potential the year started out with UT putting in even more work by appearing on the web drama compulsory dating education with Lunas choo but back at off the record they were working with promise 9 to bring a little fun back into people's lives this summer [Music] as you can see this was promised nines first single album Fun Factory and the title track fun it was promised time in the summer Sun with this electric pop song in the same vein as love bomb but mixing in some different moments of musical color promise now I got to show even more this comeback and if you take a look at the lyrics for the song they rhymed ariana grande with Caramba a lyric that has yet to be taught by anyone in the music industry ever promise nine would promote not only fun but the b-side love rum pum pum extending the promotion time for this new album but promise failed to get their first win which was what a lot of fans were hoping for for this group but the moment wasn't lost as promised built up a very strong fan base in Korea doubling the sales of their previous album selling over 60,000 to date we also got to see them ranked second on the guy on the highest for promised 9 yet but now is 2020 and we have a scene a new single or album out of promise for over a year what happened well promise was actually preparing to debut in Japan with the digital single of love bomb but those plans were postponed as a little-known Cygnus hit Asia and quickly spread around the globe now while pumice hasn't been releasing music they have been pretty active on their V app and YouTube channel with their original content you would think that they're just waiting for a good opportunity to set a comeback date but back in 2019 the e-voting manipulation scandal of the produce series had a domino effect in k-pop idol school had its own investigation into the show being rigged the story blew up when a contestant on ida school d haein sat down and had an interview explaining her experience on the program and the details were not pretty she first talked about how the show claimed there was an audition process 3000 trainees showed up but those that actually made it onto the show weren't at those auditions they were apparently already chosen by the producers B Hagen was also suspiciously cut in the final episode when she was a fan favorite that was always ranked high even viewers were shocked she was eliminated by training these search terms me and Idol school not only that but there was claims of mistreatment and bad filming conditions trainees were on a strict diet even when they didn't need it their phones were also taken away during shooting with no way to contact others the sets they filmed on were just recently made so the smell of paint was really strong there's a lot more that happened on the show that I can't talk about you have to search it for yourself so with Dad news coming out around the tail under 2019 I'm sure this is why promise 9 has been on this hiatus like I said they are still active and it's not as bad as being completely silent but you can see the members are a bit bored and wanting to be back to creating music and promoting another possible reason for the hiatus is the fact that I mentioned before that both Thomas 9 and eyes one is managed by the same company off the record they're a new label and I don't know how many employees they have but since the Perdue scandal they've been working hard to get eyes 1 up and running again when they come back that just happened days ago highest one was probably priority over Thomas 9 but now that things are starting to clear up I have hoped that promise 9 will be back faster than you think the whole point of Idol school was to take ordinary girls with dreams of becoming an idol and make them just that and to a point they made a group that was smaller in size notoriety and some would say Talent but what they did have was a big heart and some fake songs then had a big impact I'd say don't worry about promise 9 they'll be back bigger and better than ever that's it for me and that's it for this video hopefully you enjoyed if you did please get this video like and remember only 14% of people that
