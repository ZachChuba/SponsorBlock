the first pvp update in ages revenant caves have been made single with a pj timer in place to encourage 1v1 fighting day of release is always the most active and it's always the best time to go out looking for loot so without further ado let's get up there and some good gear and snatch ourselves some loot sponsoring today's video yo good luck gunman [Music] bro he lost his skull he's dead he's actually dead by the way good fight huh i did not expect to get him i thought he was actually going to get out of that oh he was he was unskulled though bro yeah seven point six eight mil i don't think he's gonna trade it to me because i rage caped him if he logs out i'm gonna lose my mind bro i just wasted a spellbook by the way but it is what it is 382 dude this all seems way too sketch though nah this ain't sketch he's dead rajan you're trolling do you not have a charge glory or what i'm so confused he didn't have a charge glory by the locks of things it's not on her name interesting he just dropped my seats for his friend and i picked it up dude if i got that barrage that could have been something it is what it is good fight guys we appreciate the battle okay fair enough isn't this guy aussie though why are we fighting in world 30 some part of my brain thought he's gonna change the primage there because he was unfrozen i'm gonna kill him i'm gonna kill him by the way he's dead so i could have combo that guy out for a pretty big set while he was panicking but right now one of the worst things with this update is if you leave the cave and go back in you actually have a grace period where no one can attack you but you can attack someone in the cave and he got a box with his friend and managed to escape from him bro i'm new i was streaming this entire pk session and somehow i managed to run into the same guy again in a different world so at this point i wasn't really sure what was going on with the spear because someone logged in in full max strength and i thought they were just gonna have that guy try and close back me out by pj'ing me somehow oh he tried to get someone to underline call me he's dead freeze freeze freeze nice early please see so we can't do it there's no now you guys are probably wondering how did i just die for max i'm pkaying in the singles only revenant caves yet i got attacked by 10 people while already in combat well ladies and gentlemen i have a simple answer for you and that answer is jay x they released the update saying that the entire rev caves were single which is what they were meant to be but where this rock used to be was one tile of multi this rock will now forever be known as the did a bit of rock because for some reason that square was multi and the people who killed me figured it out and decided to abuse it rather than report it and i was streaming live at the time so they had that guy who i should have killed for max about 10 times bait me obviously i didn't really know it was a bait because i should have killed him about 10 times so fair play to them and i ended up dying for 160 mil and jax introduced this stag of my or whatever you call it in the square like 10 minutes after i died couldn't do it 10 minutes before unfortunately but to the dual arena we go let's [ __ ] go please bro please i got glitch out of 160 bill youssef okay up five up thirteen well not up there no okay dude if he wins this i'm done with life i'm legit up so much so while that team had to split my 160 mil 20 ways and get the glitch patched instantly right after because they killed me on stream i went and chucked 200 mil and still made money off that death so i'm happy let's carry on p game what the [ __ ] did i just get jumped by dad good fight i hit a 78 at the start big [ __ ] hit 1.2 million i'm [ __ ] i don't even know what i'm doing here nice we love those hits is he done to that 37 come on 2500k good fight dude i don't even know how he got gap in the first place gg dude let's pick that all up 2.3 more that guy told me to come where bro where how much lose that 1.8 mil what come on why you praying major only change your prayer bro how do you even know i've got a volatile ball tell us beckham and i hit a zero awesome go into the volatile again nice i think he's dead to that 62 broadcast garage kill 20. there we go nice he's full 13 is he smited there there we go nice 42. there's no way this guy has agility this is an hd spk or is he just trolling me he might have just turned that off just because he got tv i don't know oh only a heavy blessed video he was out of food no ags unfortunately 1.1 mil unfortunately my recording of this clip got corrupted but the friend i was pking with was recording too there are a bunch of small arms teams fighting in this world and we managed to spell book swap tv the guy with the ellie [Music] i killed him but i didn't get the smite but it was a very nice 33 mil pk bad and i'll choose a winner in the next video personally i think the activity it had on release was great but the issues with the cave entrance as well as multi not being properly tested on top of the fact the whole community didn't even know the changes had come when the update hit just makes it another poorly done half-assed pvp update and i've decided i'm quitting pking for trouble laser league peace
