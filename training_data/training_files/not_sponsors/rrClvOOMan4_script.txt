description down below I'm not going to spoil this video for any of you but I guess I just wanted to express one thought I just have rust is an amazing thing for a lot of us the game is very repetitive but even in all of its commonalities that we relate to every day seems to be a bit different I don't know how many times I've been surprised by the randomness of this game and even after seven thousand hours accumulated there's always something novel to experience because of new players and groups on different servers the game creates new possibilities of sharing different stories that I just love the show all of you anyway let's get to it the following is vanilla rust got lots of coin okay so for this block window that's coming up we gotta hit a button to open it you gotta click this thing right let's what what the [ __ ] he's trolling just go through dude okay yeah yeah so they can't see all the windows like see if it's good or bad together yeah that's [ __ ] cool dude yeah it really is you can't really see through it it was nighttime when I logged in so or not logged in I thought it was a window so and go pick it up I also made this traditional oh do we have a bunch of these I can make a pie of the recipe so when you fly the passenger can turn off and all on the same side or we keeping the tub to your guns we don't really know a lot we don't think being the
