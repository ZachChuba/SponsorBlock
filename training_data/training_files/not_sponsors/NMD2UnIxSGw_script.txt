so the traditional way to build a gaming machine you got your monitor you got your gaming tower and they're separate not today so colorful of all people reached out to sponsor a video featuring the eye game g1 a gaming all-in-one that I thought was pretty cool until I cracked open the box and had a look at this thing that's it it's that thin you compare that to some other gaming monitor and it's like wait a minute they put a hold PC in there too let's check this thing out shall we [Music] accessories packing fool whatever they sponsored this video they knew what they were getting total victim-blaming here right now but I'm not even sorry so honestly speaking guys I know almost as little about this thing as you do because colorful did send me over a one-pager but the problems it really was actually exactly one page there's almost no information on it so I do know that it has an 8th gen HK series processor and r-tx 2080 and it features a 144 Hertz 1440p HDR 400 monitor all integrated into this single unit I do wonder a little bit about colorful 'z customers though like do they really need a warning about not touching the screen when you're when you're using it guess people are used to touchscreens the younger generation yeah accessory package pretty straightforward got your power cord you've got your massive power brick because yes my friends this puppy is looking at needing anywhere up to about 330 watts of power I'm actually kind of impressed they've got those kinds of specs with a passive external power supply it's quite possible that in addition to the mobile CPU colorfull is also using a mobile GPU but we're gonna find out exactly what kind of turbo speeds we can get out of it in just a moment here io wise we've got three USB Taipei's a USB type-c Ethernet of some sort we're gonna find out how fast that is our power in HDMI in and out see this is what I'm talking about why doesn't every a IO have this because one day eventually this computer will be slow and it would be really nice if it could still be used as a monitor and this one can and then finally we've also got that is presumably a display port out and a Kensington lock so the entire bottom has your on screen display controls their headphone and microphone jack nice to see dedicated jacks for those as well as a whole whack of ventilation the bottom here looks like a speaker grille with an array mic as well as that's either an ambient light sensor or a webcam hard to tell at this point we will find that out later and then there we go the entire top of the unit more ventilation and the back more ventilation and the sides more ventilation so these like gay Marie accents that are on the back of the monitor are actually just gay Marie ventilation oh that's cool I thought this was maybe the power button but it's actually a switch for the webcam so I see what's going on down here the ambient sensors like over here somewhere this is a Windows hello enabled webcam and then it just has a privacy shield on it so you've got sound control reset reposition OSD information brightness contrast a white point adjustment overscan and resizing and input select and that is pretty much it so what it looks like is that it's more like a monitor connected to a computer and less of like an embedded display port display being connected directly to a mobile GPU but the only way for us to find that out for sure would be to crack it open which I do intend to do first let's get some games loaded on this thing it really is impressive how thin this thing is like it just looks like a monitor so however the cooling system intakes which is probably through these vents here as well as the bottom it's definitely exhausting at the top oh right I wanted to find out how fast they into the Ethernet is gigabit okay so just regular gigabit we can see here it's definitely a mobile GPU in there because the connector here is laptop display and no outstanding motion blur issues which is really lucky because given that there's not a ton of fine control in the OSD they could have easily cranked up something like the overdrive strength and you could have ended up with a bunch of weird artifacts depending on how they decided to tune it and it looks like they've taken a fairly sensible middle-of-the-road approach to it oh that was inevitable it's got our GB lighting all right so while we wait for some games to install let's go ahead and explore the config a little bit more I've loaded up a couple utilities here so first of all in the Nvidia driver we're definitely running at 2560 by 1440 a hundred and forty-four Hertz but for those curious no it's not running in g-sync although I will do a driver update see if that situation changes our CPU is a core I 989 50 HK so it's a six core processor 2.9 gigahertz base and I haven't really hit it hard enough to see what it'll boost to but you can see right here just dragging a window around it is boosting to 4.2 gigahertz actually that's probably fairly representative now that I think about it because we're also installing doom in the background that's not bad so our all core turbo is hovering around 3.45 gigahertz not too shabby we can definitely hear the fan ramped up though now she going oh and it's done already that is not a bad score 1100 pretty good for a mobile chip let's try our twenty so it's a little bit on the lighter side for a desktop because remember we're using laptop components it's a super slim design so it's like really more like a laptop but like flat and in the form of a monitor but temps are well under control our max fare was 70 degrees on the hottest core which is perfectly reasonable for someone of these six core core I nines in fact better than we see in laptops really because realistically because they are able to take in air from the bottom and exhaust it at the top they actually have quite a bit more cooling flexibility here as for our score we are right up there with a 7700 K so we've got a clock speed disadvantage but of course we've got two more cores meaning that you could expect to get some legitimate work whether it's you know photo editing or a graphic design or even light video editing done on something like this what we don't know yet is whether it's a max Q or a max P that is quiet versus performance design all right we've got some games installed but before we launch them I want to play a fun little game that I like called find the SSD OEM part number that's more fun than it sounds so you fire up task manager and you can see some basic information we've got a 512 gig nvme SSD from Samsung and then a whole bunch of gobbledygook over here so we're gonna go ahead and key that what is usually some kind of part number into Google and we end up with two hits one hit dang that's really not much but that tells us all that we need to know this is a some PM 981 so it's not necessarily the same as a 970 Pro but it's a little bit better than a 970 Evo meaning that you are looking at current gen flagship Samsung nvme SSD performance on this thing not a bad thing to have one thing that was noticeable about the config overall actually is that it's got two terabytes of hard drive based storage as well so it really seems like the config here is optimized for something like a LAN cafe where you want to save space you want high performance on r-tx 2086 core CPU but you don't necessarily mean the top-of-the-line performance and you need enough space to have a big game library but you also don't need it to be that fast so you can go ahead and throw a hard drive in for that very interesting 144 Hertz vsync Oh traffic's let's crank on it highest with no motion blur so I noticed the in-game volume was a little louder than I wanted and my immediate reaction was to go into the OSD and adjust the volume in there but nope nope there we go software volume control only my friends around the benchmark I love that high refresh rate IPS monitors are a thing now like it used to be you either had gaming performance or non I see and color fidelity why not both now ramped up really strongly there for a second but it seems like the way they've tuned the fan curve has a ramping up aggressively against a new heavy load but then actually dialing back a little bit it's not the kind of thing that you would hear over headphones for example but if you weren't using headphones the fan noise is clearly audible alright fantastic so average FPS of around 90 with details absolutely cranked and sixty degrees max not bad I guess that's what happens when you can build what would effectively be a 27 inch laptop you've got a ton more space for cooling so our core clocks are up in these seventeen hundred megahertz are so range that is not too shabby for a mobile GPU I gotta say it is really impressive how far the tech has come in the last few years like this is a great gaming experience literally built into the back of a monitor so it's sitting next to that skull trail machine that I actually showed a little while ago so this is what a super high-end gaming rig looked like 11 years ago actually guys if you're not already subscribed make sure you are so you don't miss our follow up on this one we're gonna be taking our skull trail machine and hooking it up with to RTX 2080 t is an SLI is to see what happens in the meantime though what is going on here is that one screw just lifts up the whole thing so you turn this thing that's why you're so hard to turn and there's like a little mechanism in there you see that that like tries up the computer oh I think I got it yeah there goes he's a madman ladies and gentlemen oh yeah there it is we got three sides and once you got three sides battle is basically over oh by the way don't check out our merch LTT store com it's great quality stuff okay interesting they've actually packed the entire PC inside this shielded enclosure so a lot of what I thought was ventilation holes actually isn't so all that stuff along the bottom seems to be just kind of fur for styling so the front is speaker grilles for these two large speakers here and then those ones at the back are intakes and actually the vast majority of the cooling is handled by these two large heat exchangers here each of which has two heat pipes and like I had suggested this one is dedicated to cooling the CPU with just this one thick heat pipe and then this one does most of the heavy lifting for the GPU with a third heat pipe presumably coming off the GPU going over to this one now that we've gone this far I don't think there's any way that we can avoid taking off the shield though I sort of assumed everything would be kind of bare inside but it's much more tightly integrated than some of the gaming a iOS that I've seen in the past look at this that is got to be the thickest thermal pad I've ever seen now normally you probably wouldn't bother with a thermal pad on something like this but because of the way they've designed the cooling with almost no sort of just general airflow in here and most of the cooling handled by taking this heat and moving it out via heat pipes and then expelling it I can see why they'd feel like they need to do that so this our MDOT to drive here is also cooled by a thermal pad up against this giant heat spreader so that's what it actually is it seems to be more of a heat spreader here's our Intel Wireless and then as I had guessed it our CPU is handled by the one heat pipe in our GPU and memory is handled by these three and that explains why our thermals are so good because these are shonky heat pipes pretty impressed by those I just want to see if there's more so different slots down there really does not don't look like it like maybe there's somewhere else to solder them on but I don't think the actual amounts are soldered on so the last thing of note here is that we do have an additional m2 slot so we could expand our storage again should we see fit so that's it that's all guys if you like this teardown we've actually got a monitor of repair guide that you're definitely going to want to check out and by
