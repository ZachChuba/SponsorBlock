[Music] so a little while ago I did a video on how photography can make you unhappy I'll link to that in the description below if you haven't seen it I thought I'd change after at this time and do what about how photography can make you happy because I've been reading Darren Brown's book lately called happy why more or less everything is absolutely fine this great book I highly recommend it in it he talks a lot about stoic and epicurean philosophy and the importance being in the now but an important thing he talks about is how that he's now happier now now he's rich and famous than he was when he was just getting by doing small magic gigs at private parties and there's been a lot of research done into how material wealth affects happiness and if we look at the results of all the studies done that it's very interesting basically increases in material wealth only increase the level of happiness people experience up to a very basic level of survival beyond that it kind of plateaus and anymore increases in material wealth don't actually make you any happier for me I think happiness is probably more complex than I think about it on a daily basis probably is more multifaceted and exists in more different forms than I currently understand it there's a certain form of happiness that I do experience and a lot of us can experience and this is where photography comes into it and it's a stage you can get yourself into and it's a state that's been kind of talked about for thousands of years particularly in some Eastern philosophies but it wasn't until the 1970s that it was investigated scientifically and properly given a name and for that we have to thank the work of Hungarian American psychologist Mihai Cinque sent me hi me hi Csikszentmihalyi grew up in Europe and was around seven years old when the second world war hit over this period he would see many people around him retain their ability to experience happiness even after their jobs homes and security were destroyed by the war and this fascinated him and led him to start examining what would end up becoming a life's work into the study of happiness as his research progressed he began to look at artists and other creative people in order to understand what it was that drove them to spend their lives essentially doing things for which they worked very hard without the expectation of significant financial reward or notoriety he began to find commonality in the form of mental state that many of them described going into when they made productive work a state of full immersion in what they were doing a state that triggered a kind of energized focus one where they were so focused they lost all sense of time and space around them they would forget to eat or not notice hours tick by as the creative process just seemed to flow out of them because so many people described this flowing creativity Csikszentmihalyi and the term flow for this state he postulates three conditions that have to be met in order to achieve the flow state one one must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress this adds direction and structure to the task to the task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback this helps the person negotiate any changing demands and allows them to adjust their performance to maintain the flow state and three one must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task at hand and their own perceived skills one must have confidence in one's own ability to complete the task at hand Csikszentmihalyi maps this out more fish with this 8-channel model the horizontal access represents your level of skill from low to high and on the vertical axis we have the level of skill required to complete the challenge of the task you are attempting the mid point represents the mean level of skill for you personally and so flow is achieved when both the challenge level and the skill level are higher than average and when they work symbiotically together to achieve your goal the flow state can be triggered when you are playing the piano when you're doing an extreme sport even when you're getting into a deep philosophical conversation with a good friend or when you're taking editing photos flow is about being completely present in the moment it gives us a form of mental freedom risk-taking vastly increases creativity vastly increases all our focus is directed at the task at hand and that means that our anxieties become diminished as they are formed from bad things that have happened in the past and the possibility of what bad things may happen in the future our mind is drawn completely into the now on top of that scientists have discovered the flow also gives our brains a profound neurochemical release we get a massive hit of feel-good chemicals and these feel-good chemicals are also performance enhancing chemicals tests have shown that learning a memory when in the flow state is increased by between 230 and 500 percent flow falls into the category of what we call autotelic meaning the experience of the state has a purpose in and of itself the state itself has intrinsic value and so therefore we are driven to create purely for the love of creating and so achieving the flow state means that we achieve what many would describe as pure happiness and so to echo Socrates on the perils of an unexamined life discover where your passion lies and spend your life mastering it but happiness aside while it's a difficult thing to quantify the current belief is that being in a state of flow makes people around five times more productive than they are on an average day the means that in the flow state a person could achieve in one day what they would normally accomplish over a whole working week scientists studying this mental phenomenon now believe that flow is responsible for most significant feats of human achievement be that sporting metals one scientific advances or breakthroughs in the arts so bringing this back to photography as I probably should seeing as this is a photography Channel as I've said before in previous videos don't fixate on gear too much it won't make you happier it's scientifically proven and it won't make you a better photographer obviously if you need something for a specific purpose by it that goes without saying but concentrate instead on using what you've got to achieve that flow state to get yourself to that level where you become ultra productive and happy at what you're doing because that is what it's all the first 500 people who click it so be quick if you want to do that [Music]
