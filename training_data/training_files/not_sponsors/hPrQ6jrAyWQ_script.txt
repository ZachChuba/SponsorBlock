a portion of this video was sponsored by Ray to shadow legends alright so I thought I'd start off this episode with something fun and nostalgic this is project project this is progress bar 95 it's a pretty chill and casual game that I'm sure speaks to a lot of you out there those of you that know what it was like to deal with Windows 95 and for those that don't and just one a little taste of the past the concept of the game is simple you just Philip this progress bar in order to win but I think this game really shines with individuals and sound effects whether you've used Windows 95 or not like the developer says this game is sure to make you smile I know it made me smile for sure I love this next up we've got raid shadow for sponsoring this portion of the video now on to the rest next up we've got a pea weather now this weather app was first seen on Windows Phone years ago but it finally joined at the Play Store this past summer it also joins a very saturated market of weather applications happy weather stands out with its super clean and easy to navigate user interface it's got a real neat font and nice animations as well and while it may be simple in its looks it's actually loaded with pretty much all the weather info you could ever want seriously it's got everything it's also very customizable with different themes it's got a good number of widgets you can put on your home screen you can customize those as well and more if you get this app and enjoy it I highly recommend you support the developer and upgrade to Abbey weather plus for that occasionally patch this happens to help and motivate you in an effort to improve things like communication problem-solving health finances time management and much more and the deep stash team puts together a bunch of different assets to help do just that the app is very well made everything is laid out nicely it's easy to understand and it actually goes pretty in-depth I found that this is a pretty neat app to have around and I think everyone can get something out of it have we done the list we're taking a look at the blob live wallpaper by one of my all-time favorite devs Mac Celeste net so this one's real simple it's just this big colorful flowing blob and it looks amazing especially on OLED displays because well that's what it was designed for you can grab this for free and it is absolutely gorgeous but you can unlock extra features like full on customization and this little temporary widget that you can use to cycle through different colors and different styles and when you're done you just hit OK this has quickly become my new favorite live wallpaper it's really fun to stare at and if you have a device with an OLED display I think you'll love it too at application number 6 we've got this quote widget and shout out to James over on Twitter for showing me this one it's pretty self-explanatory it's a widget that you can toss under your home screen and it lets you cycle through different quotes in the application itself you can change pretty much everything about how the widget looks and operates you can change the text color the background color of the text size text alignment all that stuff it's a really simple widget that'll be sure to add a nice touch to your home screen speaking of adding stuff to your home screen if you're looking for something new to add to your home screen check out spiffy 4 kW GT now this pack has actually been my most used as of late and as you may have seen in previous videos because I really enjoy what it has to offer it comes with over 100 different very well made widgets all of which look very clean and unique the main theme with these widgets is to provide as much information as possible without it looking super messy or cluttered they're definitely a nice accent piece now a real nice complementary icon pack would be this one right here this is a Glade ian's this pack boasts well over 2,000 icons and 15 different wallpapers to match up as of this video the wallpapers are excellent and they provide at the perfect backdrop for the icons and the icons themselves are absolutely beautiful they're very well made they're bright and colorful and they'll definitely add a nice pop to your home screen now gradient goes for two bucks but if you're interested in getting it for free I've got ten promo codes for you guys down below in the description it's a first-come first-served basis so make sure you act as fast as you can hit that like button if you want more promo codes and shout out to the developer max for the hook-up all right so closing out the list with a couple relaxing games the first one is called one line now this app has actually been out for well over a year but I just tried it out a few months ago for the first time the concept here is pretty simple all you have to do is trace this outline in a single line fashion so you cannot cross over something you've already traced it sounds simple but the game has proven to put your brain to the test overall it's a nice very relaxing game with clean visuals neat sound effects and calming background music the second game is called here this one also came out over a year ago and I'm just now trying it out as well now here is a bit more quirky than one line but this two will really get you thinking there are 50 unique levels and they're all based around the word here it's really weird especially with the mysterious background music but it's actually very cool at the same time and I ended up really enjoying it the games got smooth animations a super minimal interface and overall I think you guys would get a kick out of it [Music] but that's gonna do it for this month's best Android apps I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did feel free to
