online store make your next move with Squarespace when I was studying in seminary we used to have this phrase which just said we preach best what we need to hear most I'm gonna have a bit of a rant today but it really is because I need to remind myself of this quite a lot so let me give you a bit of backstory this week I went out and bought the Fuji XT 20 and to help pay for this I sold some other gear including my original Fuji X 180 and it was small fit in the bag with me every day it was 35 mil equivalents it was great for street photography it was fairly nondescript some people didn't pay attention to me that first generation one had the the Bayer sensor which renders color quite beautifully and it had its quirks I mean it's autofocus was terrible you've heard me say and some of the operation it tended to be a little bit clunky being that first generation one but for me it was a tool that did a specific job but as a tool the Fuji x100s hit its limits for me I wanted to shoot portraits sometimes and I even bought the the little tele focal length converter on it so it gives you a 50 mil equivalent on that but the focusing was just too bad to be able to shoot lifestyle portraits with people on the go I wanted to see if I could find a camera system which was still lightweight still nondescript on the street but gave me the ability to shoot a little more intimately with subjects so that's why I've got this and I got the 23 mil f2 which is gives me basically exactly the same as what I have with a Fuji X 100 and then I've got the 35 mil F 1.4 which isn't as fast as the 35 f2 it's an older lens but it's slightly shallower and it's gonna give me the opportunity when I slow down for those portraits that I will be able to click this on and get some really good looking stuff so after I've got the camera I took a photograph of it and I post it on my Instagram account and just said you know I saw the x100 and this is what I bought and this is probably what I'll be shooting with on my Instagram account from this point onwards now normally on my Instagram account I'll get between 10 Dean 20 comments on a post but this post got five times that some people said oh my gosh that's amazing your photos are gonna get so much better now well done some people said things like oh but you said the x100 was amazing four straight and you had reasons for it then now you've changed as if sort of suggesting that you know I'm now a hypocrite because I changed my mind some guys a couple of them got hold of me it through there and different accounts saying oh we're really disappointed I went out and bought an X 100 because you said it was a good street camera and now you seem to be changing your mind so this is how I really feel about all this stuff that I've just said none of it matters the fact that I used to shoot with the x100 doesn't matter the fact that I now shoot with the X t20 doesn't matter the fact that all my professional work is shown on canons does not matter we obsess so much and I'm saying this to myself as much we obsessed so much about the gear that we think we need that we absolutely can't do without that will take our photography to the next level never ever buy a camera because I use it because I promise you in Olympus in Panasonic in Canon and Nikon and Fuji in Leica in any other camera range there are cameras that will do pretty much the same thing and you will have to pixel peeps so close to see any difference the brand that you use the lenses that you buy are only tools to be a photographer making you a good photographer is all about your brain behind the camera I know I have a tendency to get too wrapped up in this I'm much better at it than I used to be but I looked through a lot of gear reviews and a lot of videos a lot of tests before I bought the XT 20 and that's good I mean it's good to know what the camera does but only looking at it in so much as it's a tool that's going to do the job of photography for me but I still had the responsibility to be the photographer I know way too many people who've gone out and spent huge amounts of money they've maxed out credit cards on gear that they were convinced that they needed and all that happened was they had a very very fancy camera but still took average photographs because the camera will not do the job for you I want a medium format camera system I mean of course I do I've looked at them for ages especially for my portrait work I think it would be lovely to have one but I have to be honest with myself and say I don't have the money to buy one I can't afford one with where at the moment and will it actually make my photographs better if I bought a brand new hustle blood system with all the bells and whistles and started shooting portraits and posted them on my website and online would people actually go wow on this date your photography went from from bad or average to incredible overnight I don't think most people would even notice that I bought a new camera system unless I announced it which says to me that what I have now is absolutely good enough no excuses I remember early on thinking if I went out and bought the same cameras that my hero shot with I would start to shoot the same images that they shot the same quality obviously that's bollocks but that creeping can still start to sink into the back of our heads when we're processing this stuff looking at the images that professional photographers are taking thinking well I'll just spend a lot of money and I'll get those results it's not the truth I mean I'm not one of the world's most amazing photographers but I get quietly offended when people go to my website and this has happened they look through images and they'll go wow these look really great you must have an amazing camera I mean that is as ridiculous as as going to a michelin-starred restaurant having some perspective altering meal and wanting to speak to the chef afterwards to say hey this was an incredible meal you must have an amazing oven I've literally heard people say stuff like I can't shoot anymore until I get a better camera I mean gear the idea of needing better gear is crippling them going out and taking photographs with what they have cartier-bresson on famously said your first 10,000 photographs are your worst if you're using gear as an excuse to not be shooting regularly you're postponing getting those 10,000 out of your system so you can become a great photographer I don't believe buying this new camera is going to make me take better photographs I just think it's the right tool for the job I think you can scroll back through my Instagram over the coming months put the X T 20 shots who gets the X 100 you'll be hard-pressed to see a quality difference I mean my first 700 photographs on my Instagram account are from my iPhone and I'm still proud of a lot of them there is no excuse to not use the camera you have to go out there and develop what really counts which is your photographers brain so remember this is not what takes great photographs this is this is just the tool and if you put any other camera in my hand I hope that using my photography brain I can still use it to take great images so don't go out there dropping huge amounts of money you can't afford on fancy gear thinking it will make your photography better because it probably won't there are much better investments to make take whatever camera you have get out there and shoot as often as you can get those ten thousand photographs out of your system you'll feel your photographs getting better rather than sitting and waiting and saving money hoping that some camera will be a fix-all read about other photographers develop yourself as a person walk around even when you don't have a camera with you and recognize good light and think about it process it in your brain because this is where the photography actually happens and if you put your time and energy here rather than here I promise you you'll be better before you know it thanks again to Squarespace com forward slash Sean Tucker to get 10% of your first purchase [Music] [Music]
