good morning guys welcome to another vlog I thought I would do kind of a daily vlog today I've wanted to stop painting for a while and I actually did a painting which if you've been watching my videos you will have seen because I've shown it and I filmed the whole process but then I stupidly formatted the card and deleted it all so I thought today I would do another painting this one's gonna be quite different I want something kind of abstract so the first one that I did is this sea painting and this is for my mom she's just redone her kitchen and she's like opened up her kitchen and dining room and it's a really big room now so I thought I would do a painting for her wall if she wanted it because she's obsessed with like nautical things and honestly the amount of references to the sea that she has in her house is insane so I did this painting anyway and she loves it and she really wants to hang it up but the next one I want to do is one for me I actually want it for my bedroom in my new flats and I just want something that isn't really an actual picture just like kind of abstract more just like nice colors nice to look at so we're going to be trying to do that today this is a second ever painting that I've done ever so if it goes wrong or it doesn't look very good that is why but that does actually bring go through to skill share and sign up for your free two months so I'm gonna start my painting now I'm actually kind of nervous I think I'm gonna keep doing these painting videos though and as I'm taking my classes with Skillshare you'll hopefully be able to see some improvement over time which will be exciting I've always wanted to be one of those people who has their own art everywhere in the place and like when people come around they're like Oh where's that from and you can be like oh that's all big that's my new little goal in life let's see how close we can get to becoming Picasso I'm excited oh my god I took my blanket off my bed last night it was so hot and look who sat on it have you made a nice little home cute [Music] it's the same story being told [Music] too shy too to be a man this world [Music] [Applause] [Music] the time's running down take the chair don't stay open to the but to tear my [Music] cuz I know ooh [Music] ha [Music] kinda strong [Music] yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so I've finished my painting now I'm not too sure how I feel about it I think I like it but I'm gonna have to live with it for a couple of days probably to decide whether I do actually like it or not let me know what you think in the comments as I said I wanted something kind of abstract that doesn't really have a purpose but this is my finished painting I think I'm not actually that keen on the gold in it maybe I would have liked it more if it just like transitioned lighter and lighter but I do really like how much texture it's got I love paintings that I've got texture because every single angle that you look at the mat looks different so like this angle looks really chunky but then if you look from the front it looks kind of more blended I thought I would show you something that's arrived today that I'm really excited about so actually guys know I have literally nearly bought somewhere like it's so close to being bought it should be mine pretty much the start to middle of May and the first renovation that I'm gonna do is the bathroom so I've been trying to decide what kind of vibe I want in the bathroom and I've actually fully decided now I ordered some tile samples and I love them so I thought I would show you them so I got these samples from tiles direct this is not in any way sponsored by them so this is the one that I want for the floor and I want it to go up the side of the bath and up the sink as well it's just like matte white hexagons and I want that with white grout so it should just look really clean and simple and then I've been trying to decide on the shower unit I'm having quite a big shower and I wanted like a feature in there so I ordered this this is the shape that I want like regardless of which tile I pick but I ordered this one I ordered this Chevron II one that's like shiny and then I ordered this one which is a towel that I'm actually going to go with it's matte black and I'm gonna have it in that same kind of pattern that this one is in in my shower unit I'm gonna have it with white grout and then I actually ordered some pink ones just to look at I love this but I feel like pink will age whereas the black won't age and I can have like pink towels if I want them but yeah I finally decided on my tiles I'm really excited it all feels real now I'm actually going to meet a builder later today at my new place just to like get quotes and stuff for how much it's gonna cost it's also exciting don't be a stranger in the night take a chance for some romance don't copy your love trees know you better anyone else it's time you
