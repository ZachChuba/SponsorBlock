what's more date night than finding out that you just got catfished surprise suckers this is what i secretly looked like all along catfish cod and mahi are three of like five total fish offerings at a typical grocery store out here with so few boring choices in a literal sea of possibilities it's no wonder why salmon is everyone's favorite normie fish this mahi mahi doesn't have much fat or color so if i want to break away from the usual white fish fate of beer battered fish and chips or baja tacos this is how i like to dress them up heat a heavy amount of coconut oil or ghee in a small nonstick pan both of these fats are high heat tolerant and high in flavor if you use a big pan it'll take a lot more fat to cook the fish heat this up until you see whisks of smoke and then gently lay in two fillets that have been patted dry and salted if your fish has skin on it do this skin side down additionally if i was going to do it skin side down i would try butter basting the fish so that the skin could get extra crispy while the flesh cooks all the way through but since my pre-packaged vacuum sealed mass-produced kroger fish only comes in boneless and skinless fillets i'll just cook it on both sides for about three minutes each once cooked these can come off the pan and into a holding pattern while i make the sauce so pour off all but a couple of teaspoons of this flavorful oil and add a big pinch of super thinly sliced shallots a white onion would work just fine here as well follow that up with a thinly sliced jalapeno or serrano pepper salt and stir when your peppers and onions have softened add some finely diced tomato to the pan salt that too most of the flavor is going to come from the next ingredient curry paste homemade would be the most flavorful jarred paste would be okay but you will need a lot more of it make sure that it's at least got a strong amount of ginger and garlic in it pop a spoonful in and coat your veg in it things will get smoky real quick so just let this go for 30 seconds or so and cool it off with full fat coconut milk you can add more or less depending on how concentrated you want that flavor it's pretty hard for me to give you a concrete volume since i don't know what kind of paste you're using this is why it is good to taste as you go cook this down for just a minute or two salt it to taste cut the heat and add some brightness in the form of lime zest and lime juice spoon the sauce into a shallow bowl and let your fish warm back up into it if there were skin on this i would plate this skin side up so that it stays crispy and looks pretty since all i have to work with is plain white i will adorn it with a couple sprigs of cilantro and a nest of super thinly sliced scallions cut out an angle serve this with a side of stir-fried green beans roasted sweet potatoes or just a plain bowl of all of the white rice you started hoarding in march what are you drinking wine but we'll talk about that on the next episode ooh money time a bunch of people were commenting on my last post saying where's the ring thinking that you left we're not married yet we're just engaged and who knows if we're actually going
