for that great great question i got a whole basket of them here all right thank you um uh just to change the subject a little bit i wanted to ask about social bubble social circles um i am getting emails from readers uh wondering when they can be expanded and i think as you have mentioned there's this um feeling out there that because we've gone to stage three people can relax so where are we on when the social circles would be able to increase from the current 10 same people i know that's with a health table and it's always coming up but they they want to continue on with the social circles of 10 right now and i'll ask that question when i get back on on the health table i talk to them almost every day i'll mention that but you know something this pandemic's not over it's going to continue going and in my opinion i could be wrong i'm no medical professional but my opinion this is going to january until we get a vaccine or hopefully sooner sooner when we get a vaccine and we have to be on guard constantly can't take our eye off the ball for a second uh when it comes to this because they'll come back and bite us in the backside like we've never seen before as soon as we start getting reckless and careless and everyone's out there partying away um you know it's gonna be a big problem i don't wanna what what happened in the u.s uh happen here and it can happen real real quick real quick so let's just continue on we've all worked so hard everyone's done a great job so let's just continue on as a as a strong province next question your next question comes from mike crowley with cbc news please go ahead hi mike hi jimmy ford um we're hearing from a lot of parents who are concerned about uh the situation with the return to school plan your return to school plan and they're saying that it's not safe in particular for elementary students because of the fact that the class sizes are not being reduced and means that you know they can't do physical things easily what do you say to those concerns well first of all um it's it's not our plan we went with some of the brightest minds in the world not even canada not even ontario the sick kids medical team that's advising us along with chio and and uhn and our health team they've come up with a plan and you know if your kid is sick the first thing you want to do is bring them to the doctors and and really sick you bring them to sick kids world class so they've come up with a plan i respect their plan they're the experts we aren't the experts but for the parents that are nervous i i understand i'm i'm nervous as a premier i'm gonna be losing sleep all the way up through september to make sure these kids are safe folks there's nothing more important to me and all the parents and everyone even if you don't have kids the number one concern is to make sure our kids are safe when they go back there's to be two million kids going back into the system 160 000 teachers uh absolutely it's it's concerning but we have some of the most stringent rules in the entire country uh sometimes you guys like always mentioning bc let's look at bc our cohorts are 15. theirs are anywhere from 60 to 150 you know they don't even require masks alberta doesn't bc doesn't and i wish them all the best we're requiring mass from grade 4 all the way up through through high school uh we're having the kids in high school go half a day and then the other half is on online uh we put 80 million dollars into hiring more staff more cleaning services we're the only jurisdiction any province in the country that are hiring uh 500 nurses specifically for schools at 50 million dollars we're putting 309 million dollars more than anyone by far per capita in in the country and i won't spare a penny i'll spend whatever it takes to keep our kids safe so i i think sick kids have come up with an incredible plan i fully understand why the parents are nervous i'd be nervous if my kids were back in school they're older now but still i i fully understand the situation there and the other thing is sorry they don't have to put their kids in school they can keep them home and do online learning so it's just like when i talk to kids out there and i talk to parents the parents want certainty they want to try to go back to normal five days a week i get it and that's what we're going to be doing and the kids i've never seen so many kids wanting to get back to school in my entire life they want to see their their friends and try to get back to a normal life themselves but uh we're pulling out every stop there is absolutely everything make sure we leave no stone unturned follow up on another topic premiere some employers of uh migrant farm workers are restricting the workers movements so they're asking them basically to sign documents saying that they will not leave the premises of the farm that they're working on even if it's to do essential tasks like go to get groceries how fair of a way is that to be treating these workers well that's a federal jurisdiction but i'll make a comment on it any anyways first of all we've inspected over 160 farms and i just asked the farmers very simple get these guys tested guys gals whoever test them simple they once they get tested they come out uh negative that's great if they're positive we're going to take care of them we're going to pay them we're going to shelter them we're going to feed them so just get them tested and we're all good as for requiring someone to stay in the jurisdiction of a farm that's again the federal federal government is it fair it's only fair if they don't get tested if they get tested then go out go to the grocery store you're you're good you're good to go but again it's not for me to say that's strictly the federal government that puts those requirements in next question your next question comes from randy ross with chdhtv please go ahead hey randy yeah hi premier further to uh mike's question um you said earlier this year that you were going to roll out mobile testing for migrant farm workers in niagara um what's the status of that has that happened it is it is that happening right now yeah it is so we we have uh the mobile testing that we've set up appointments for the the farms and we're going from farm to farm we we also have a testing uh location that they can come and and go in and get tested and they want there's another one by by the hospital i want to thank the the folks at the hospital in the windsor essex area you guys are absolute champions you've come out you've supported us right at the beginning we set up the testing area and no one showed up now people are coming so we just need to we just need to get through it i you know we've learned a lot but uh just get tested it's as simple as that it's it's a no-brainer in my opinion follow-up yeah okay yeah i i want to ask you about uh the murder of darien henderson balman she was murdered allegedly by darnell reed who um the court let out on bail against the advice of the police he had many um violence and firearm offenses beforehand and he ended up murdering a woman that he had allegedly that he had a court order against court restraining order against going anywhere near um is there anything that you can think of that that could be done to stop the as patrick brown describes that revolving door in the justice system letting serious offenders out on well it's the federal government that's the problem i'm getting along extremely well with them this is in a cr this is not a criticism it's not against the feds but guys you can't keep letting these guys get out and walk the streets it's up it's up to them to toughen up on the sentences that's the biggest challenge that we're facing and not not just this case but you get up in the toronto gta what do we have 12 shootings i'd grab those little buggers and throw them in jail throw the key away and and let them rot in there they're going to go around and create violence in our neighborhoods where our kids are playing outside and and their the families don't feel safe 12 shootings you got to be kidding me throw these guys in jail guys gals mostly guys throw them in jail throw away the key simple teach them a lesson we're way too soft on crime we gotta toughen up on on the sentences and the police are frustrated too i talk to the police all the time they're frustrated they go out there put their lives on the line for us they arrest these guys and do to do two days later they're bouncing around out on bail we need to get the judges on tougher judges tougher sentences and keep our streets safe that's what people want they want a safe community and they don't want a bunch of gang bangers running around with guns it's like the wild west next question your next question comes from kevin valliere with niagara independent please go ahead hi kevin hi premier welcome to niagara thank you um mike my question is is this what you hoped for uh in terms of um making the best out of a terrible situation we've got the pandemic but now you've got different sectors like universities the private industry government all coming together innovating creating new products creating new jobs and it seems at a much more faster more rapid pace than if times were normal and are you hoping that this this type of partnership and innovation obviously can continue when we are back to normal in this province that's a fabulous question you know i'll give you an example when i talk to the minister of colleges and universities couple presidents of the colleges and universities i want to give them all the credit in the world they said doug when this pandemic hit what took us two weeks to get online would have taken us 10 10 years through the bureaucracy and and the ingenuity and the the creativity of the people and here in ontario it's absolutely staggering what i've seen you have two choices as premier you get cooped up in the in the bubble i call it down at queen's park and listen to a bunch of politicians or you get out here with the real people travel around the province listen to their concerns look at the creativity that this this piece of equipment is absolutely amazing and again made in ontario and i just keep pumping let's buy ontario maintenance up to the all the manufacturers here in ontario it's up to the walmarts the loblaws the metros the sobes the home depots the home hardwares all of you listening and and costco you have to start buying more made in ontario i went to a store i'm not going to name them and i saw a paddle a wooden paddle we have more wood than we know what to do with i'm sure we make paddles but guess what the big sticker said made in the usa make no mistake i i love our neighbors i love the us but at the end of the day we need to keep manufacturing here made in ontario and i got to give a shout out this is another great commercial if you haven't seen this commercial pull it up it's from nestle canada one of the largest world manufacturing companies and they're saying proudly made in canada i love their commercial so on their boxes they should be putting ontario made because not everyone uh is has seen their their commercial but what a great commercial i mentioned about free delay putting on every package friends i can i can tell you people going down the aisle the patriotism i've never seen this high in my entire life and they see let's use potato chips they see the made in ontario logo or made in canada i don't care what it is as long as it has a maple leaf people and everything being equal they're buying that or if you you see something else being made some widget be it barbecue grill i mentioned the grills buy ontario made i fully understand not everything can be bought here but a huge chunk of goods change at one in 10 10 10 19 billion dollars that's tens of thousands of jobs kept right here in ontario so let's see more commercials from great companies like nestle and pepsico and frito-lay everyone else step up any if you don't can't afford the commercials put that logo it doesn't cost anything for you to put that logo on your packaging next time you do a run uh put it on it's it's a massive selling feature for you guys massive your sales will go up as sure as i'm standing here follow up uh yeah just quick question in terms of how soon can we expect to see the additional i believe it was approximately 19 jobs come online with this announcement well i'm going to pass that over to the great minister of economic development and he can talk about the ontario made process as well or the boss one number two thank you premier uh your the direct answer to your question is january that's when the 19 positions will be filled by but i have to say to your earlier question as well and to this one this is exactly what premier ford was talking about when we first uh saw this pandemic hit and the premier said we got to start making our personal protective equipment here in ontario never again will we be held hostage to any other country that's holding back personal effective equipment from our front line and the businesses in ontario and the people of ontario they stood up and they stood proud that's the spirit that we saw the ontario spirit they they decided that they would retool and begin to manufacture personal protective equipment right here in ontario the premier announced a 50 million dollar ontario together fund and that's how things like this two million dollar investment are being made today out of a four million almost four million dollar investment in this facility the ontario together site went up early in the covet 19 pandemic we've seen 27 000 people go on that site and register we've seen more than eighteen thousand of those turn into sales leads we've seen the province purchase almost 800 million dollars from that website all because the ontario together is is truly together with the people of ontario and the businesses who have answered the call so i hope that helps you thank you last question your final question comes from cynthia mulligan with city news please go ahead hi cynthia hi premier um this question is from my colleague faiza amin we saw on thursday toronto public health released some really disturbing data that racialized low-income communities were hardest hit by covet so many of these communities have a lot of schools what is going to be done to protect these schools i know it's not up to individual school boards however as the premier what would you like to see happen with these schools extra measures to protect them because it does follow that if there's more in those communities then then it will go into the schools as well so there's there's two options on on the table one for rural areas that don't have a densely populated area and then there's ones for via toronto or gta or any other areas that are densely populated that the rural areas can send their kids to school all day the high school kids if they if they want but i really cynthia truly believe in following the best health experts in the world from sick kids they've put out the guidelines and just make sure that they follow them if they feel in in these areas they need more funding lower cohorts by by all means we have 80 million dollars sitting there for extra cleaning uh extra uh extra staff as as well so i'd take advantage of it and that'd be up to the the school boards to to do that but i'd make sure that that place is and span matter of fact school should always be and span it goes without saying but we uh we have to make sure everything's  and span follow up thank you premier and i'm hoping you can help me with something that the associate medical officer of hell said on thursday i was asking her then why teachers would not be tested proactively to try and quell any outbreaks and her answer and i'm quoting it says if you're testing a population that doesn't have very much covalent you'll get false positives almost half the time the person actually doesn't have cova they have something else they may have nothing so it will just complicate the picture this is this is quite surprising to me that that she's saying you get false positives almost half the time in low-risk communities can you clarify that i have reached out to the ministry and they sent me an answer that quite frankly i don't understand well i can get a direct answer but i'll never sit here and question uh you know integrity or of either doctor that we have on the health team they're both uh phenomenal they're both doing a great job and i'll make sure i get back to you on that and but i guess what uh what i'm guessing uh what the doctor was saying is let's focus on high priority areas being long-term care or people with seniors that are more successful acceptable to receiving or getting this coveted 19. the kids are a little more resilient that's kind of what i heard her say but i don't i'd never question her judgment so i'll ask and i'll be able to get back to you on that but we we have a great health team and they're doing a great job so thank you and i again i can't wait to visit the rest of the people in niagara region everyone's doing a great job here and get out there and buy ontario made products so thank you thank you everyone thank you thank you
