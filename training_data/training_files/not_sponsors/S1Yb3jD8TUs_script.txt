hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with lamb scallopini with pepper and onion agrodolce that's right every year about Easter we usually do some kind of roast lamb recipe like maybe a big old leg of lamb which is perfect for a large family gathering but I have a feeling this year's gonna be a little bit different so we're gonna take the opposite approach and go with nice thin medallions and unlike those larger more expensive cuts of meat this is super easy to achieve the perfect doneness which is gonna mean less anxiety and stress so with that let's go ahead and get started with what's basically an onion and pepper relish and we'll begin by sauteing some onions in some olive oil over medium-high heat along with a nice pinch of salt and what we'll do is cook these stirring for about four or five minutes or so or until the onions just start to soften up and begin to take on a little bit of color all right we're not really doing like a slow caramelization where these get really soft okay we want to hold on to a little bit of texture and about four minutes later mine look like this at which point we're gonna go ahead and add our diced peppers except my Pam was looking a little drier than I wanted so I went ahead and drizzled in a little more olive oil which is exactly what I want you to do if your pan looks dry but either way at this point we'll go ahead and add our peppers along with some minced garlic and we'll go ahead and cook that for a couple minutes or until those pieces of pepper just start to soften up a little and by the way I'm using a mildly spicy Fresno chili pepper but feel free to use just regular bell pepper if you want and then what we'll do once those have cooked for a couple minutes is that something we don't use very often which is some dried mint which is gonna give this a very unique and delicious flavor and yes you can use fresh mint instead but don't add that now we would add that later and we'll also this time add a splash of balsamic vinegar and then what we'll do here is cook this stirring for exactly one minute in which point we will turn off the heat and transfer this into a bowl to cool and then once this does cool down we'll go ahead and finish it off with some additional seasonings and probably some more oil and vinegar but basically the base of our pepper and onion agrodolce is done which I should have mentioned already it's just an Italian term for something that's sweet and sour or I guess technically sour and sweet and then while that's cooling we can move on to prep our lamb and wood I have here are a couple of eight ounce pieces of lamb top sirloin which are a beautiful and affordable cut imperfect for this because by cutting them in half we're gonna have four perfect four ounce pieces and as I was cutting this first one in half I came across a little tough piece of membrane which I trimmed out which is kind of ironic because I was just about to tell you how these don't really have much connective tissue inside although they do have a little which as you'll see usually reveals itself as we pound these but anyway we'll go ahead and cut those in half and take care of any obvious membrane trimming at which point we'll place those between two pieces of plastic and then pound those out to about an eighth of an inch thick maybe a little thicker but not a quarter inch so what is that 3/16 but anyway something similar to this and as I mentioned once you pound these you may see a little bit of that membrane or silver skin as its referred to and if it seems like it's gonna be easy to trim out without losing any meat I say go for it otherwise once this is floured and fried you probably won't even notice that but anyway since that was right on the surface I did take a couple seconds and trim that off and then what we'll do once we pounded our four pieces like a pro is go ahead and place those on a pan at which point we will season both sides very generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and by the way lamb top sirloin is actually pretty easy to find especially if you ask a real butcher but some boneless like the lamb steaks would also work as would some lamb shoulder so go ahead and use what you want I mean you guys are after all the dirty weenies of your scaloppine ease in case you're wondering that's my godparents name and the entire family are amazing cooks but anyway once seasoned we'll go ahead and dust those very generously with all-purpose flour and what I like to do is just do a lot on one side and then use the excess to coat the other side and by dusting it over the top like this we can put the excess back in the flour bin okay if you dipped it in a plate then you have to discard the extra oh and I should mention some people like to just season the flour and do this all in one step but I don't trust seasoned flour never have and I never will because I'm just not sure enough of the seasoning is getting to the meat so I saw in pepper mine first and then apply the flower after and then once those are prepped I like to let those sit and rest about 10 minutes before we try to fry them okay I like to give them a little time for that flower to attach to the meat which works out perfectly because by now our pepper and onion mixture is cooled and we can go ahead and finish that off which I'll do by adding some more salt and pepper as well as a nice shake a Cayenne I also added another couple tablespoons of vinegar and this time some white balsamic as well as another couple tablespoons of olive oil because I do want this fairly moist and by the way stop trying to read my shirt in the reflection you're never gonna get it and then we'll finish this up with some fresh herbs including a little bit of minced rosemary and a whole bunch of freshly chopped a-tellin parsley and that's it we'll go ahead and give that a mix and by the way I added all this stuff without even tasting it first because I knew instinctively it needed it but if you're not really experienced like me and by experienced I mean old you should probably taste it first before you start tossing stuff in oh and if you were using fresh mint this would be the point to put it in but I just want with the dry because I really loved a little bit of different flavor it gives and also the store was out of mint and my mint plant in the backyard died in a tragic spider mite attack but anyway we'll mix that up and set it aside at which point we can head to the stove and pan fry up our medallions which we'll do in some olive oil that we've gotten nice and hot over medium-high heat and I'm just gonna cook one portion in this smaller pan which would be 2 4 ounce medallions and the great thing about lamb scallopini is that we only need to cook each side for like two minutes and by the way I used way way too much olive oil here which is not a problem as far as how these are gonna cook it just means there's gonna be a lot more splattering than there needs to be so just use about half what you saw there and like I said because these are so thin we only need 2 minutes per side and if your heats high enough you should get a beautiful brown crust on those and that's it that's all there is to it we'll go ahead and pull those off and play them up and besides cleaning that drip off I also added some nice crispy simple pan fried potatoes to the plate and of course will top those with a whole bunch of our pepper and onion agrodolce and that my friends is just a magnificent way to eat lamb alright so fast so easy so beautiful so let me go ahead and slice him and enjoy that with some of our pepper onion relish on the top which I assume is gonna be very easy to do since I have a fork and a knife there we go I have no idea what happened there so I will just blame low blood sugar and trying to look in the viewfinder and I did get a lot better as I went along but anyway I'm burying the lede which is just how incredibly delicious this is I mean this was just an absolutely perfect combination of meat and condiment and not only was that pepper and onion agrodolce perfect with the lamb but it was also out of this world with those crispy pan fried potatoes and because we pounded the meat so thin we don't have to worry about medium rare medium medium-well alright just a couple minutes on each side and you're gonna have perfectly tender amazingly juicy meat every time and whether you're doing just two pieces in a small pan or like eight pieces and two big pans it really is a fairly foolproof technique and yes if you're not into lamb will also work with chicken or veal or pork or beef or really any other pound herbal protein but having said that because of the dried mint and that touch of rosemary in this relish I really do hope you do this with lamb Bhat no matter what you choose I really do hope you give this a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient amounts a principle written recipe and much more info as usual and as always enjoy
