if you have a Tesla with autopilot 2 or above you might wonder why your Tesla doesn't actually read speed limit signs when you pass them and update the posted speed limit on your display well there's a very interesting reason as to why that is that most people don't know let's break it down so before we do that we've got to do our due diligence and take care of our people for 2019 in our referral raffle open browser all right so we've got our names in here we do this real time or real time relative to this video no special cuts no tricks we've got to list the names here of Awesome people thank you so much for your support for our channel thank you so much for using our referral code you could use anyone's referral code but you use dollars so we appreciate it when we show that appreciation right now so let's spin that wheel right now [Music] that was a close one I didn't know who's gonna go to with Jennifer congratulations congratulations you're the winner of the 2019 referral raffle let's now see what you've won all right guys let's see what jennifer has won she's got a lot of prizes up here model three key fob all-weather mats diecast model three black Tesla of course we've got the black Tesla hoodie the black Tesla sweatshirt and the black Tesla snapbacks let's spin that wheel one more time make it happen [Music] all right got that black Tesla sweatshirt ready to go Jennifer reach out to us on Twitter on YouTube and we'll get your contact information and get that right out to you thanks again so much now let's get back to it if you have a Tesla built after 2016 you likely have hardware two or higher while surprise surprise your car doesn't actually read speed limit signs I know it's shocking right instead what it does is utilize GPS based speed limit zones to display what the posted speed limit is on a given really now while this works great in most scenarios there are a lot of times where the zones are incorrect or when their other speed limit signs that supersede the posted speed limit so it gives why can't your state-of-the-art Tesla even with hardware three and full self-driving enabled read speed limit signs well the answer is simply mobilized mobilized an Israeli based subsidiary of Intel that develops vision based self-driving and advanced driver assistance features and provides us technology to a majority of major auto manufacturers they are arguably the leader in vision based autonomous systems and as such they actually have a patent on using cameras to read speed limit signs this is the reason that your post 2016 Tesla can't use its camera to display the appropriate speed limit signs here's a quick look at the patent and what it says now notice I said post 2016 that's because Tesla car is built between late 2014 and late 2016 have what's known as autopilot one or hardware one which actually uses mobilised Hardware that's right before mobile I was acquired by Intel it was working very closely with Tesla and its mission to accomplish vision based full self-driving auto pilot one cars actually read speed limit signs and processed them once they passed by them and update the speed prompt accordingly now while the Tesla and Mobileye partnership ultimately ended in a pretty public manner the two companies went their separate ways but still pushing towards the same direction of full self-driving with a vision based system so unless Tesla works out a deal with mobile eye or develops a new way to get around the specifications of this patent your Tesla just simply won't be able to read speed limit signs with its cameras this is truly a bummer because reading signs is critical for the success of full self-driving and this feature alone might be a contributing factor to setting Tesla and others back even further from delivering however let's not get too discouraged and let's not count Tesla out just yet I'm sure they have some tricks up their sleeve and they'll be able to find a workaround to this and I'm eager to see what that might be and I'm also eager to see when that might come to fruition so now you know why your Tesla isn't quite able to read speed limit signs just yet let us know your thoughts in the comments and your experiences with just the gps-based or satellite based speed zones or with the hardware one Mobileye hardware and until the next time enjoy your day and enjoy your Tesla
