welcome to the Wynn show I promise that I'm late for a good reason say what it is well okay so actually I know I always end up like doing a bunch of videos last-minute on a Friday because I didn't get them done earlier in the week but this this week we actually did a bunch of really cool videos that were very very time consuming we did a build guide for the first time in since Anthony oh that's the first one I've done in like over a year cuz yeah Anthony did our last one okay so we did a build guys it's like a value AMD gaming build guide so like people are gonna you guys you guys are gonna love it it's great that's cool we converted my garage into a home theater so that was pretty sick like he's staying you got ah I'm on the fence okay so okay okay think of it okay now you know we're getting into the discussion you know what okay well one second what's going on why is this vast area alright so basically there's a couple reasons for it one is that it gets whoever is enjoying a movie away from kids who make noise oh and also kids who are sleeping away from movies that make noise right hey right yes number two is that it might be a little bit early but once autonomous vehicles and car sharing are really ubiquitous I think people are going to be converting their garages yeah because they're not gonna have cars you wanted things doesn't it like whatever so that's a trend that I'm like I want to be on that on the forefront you know the razor's edge yeah yeah yeah you know capturing gak because I don't know if you know this but when you're shopping for whether it's a house or condo or whatever the case may be the developer doesn't actually get to count garage space as square footage of the building mm-hmm so oh so basically I am salvaging back like another you know to here whatever yeah of house yeah and all I have to do because I've already got insulated walls on the outside of my garage okay all I have to do is put like a heater in there or like take out the insulation insulation balls were in there when we were working there right yeah but it was cold because there's no heat yeah but what I was gonna say is it wasn't that cold it was pretty cool it was pretty cool warm dude but yeah like if you did put on a big jacket or something you're pretty alright and had one of those heat dishes that is groin okay he was keeping his gonads from freezing literally alright that's very you know okay so we got a great okay and last minute we planned a trip where I am going down and doing two of the most exciting collabs whatever okay so I'm gonna be down in LA next week and we're gonna be working with bit wit in the collab where it's my wife versus wifey sauce oh no build challenge all they get to use are their husband's videos for how to build a PC and imma let you guys in on something I tried to cheat I tried to cheat and it ended up not working for me oh so you know how we had discussed you know maybe what I should do is I should do a new build guide and like it just filmed a new build guide different one okay so uh also today's shoot wow did I shoot that other build guide this week Nick do you remember last week ok whatever the point is it wasn't that one it was the POV build guide because I had really thought like from a first-person perspective might have been really nice for her yeah that one's not gonna be done in time ah okay so it's not gonna be up that's interesting she's gonna have to go dig through the archive to find useful videos on how to build a PC you need to watch Anthony's um that's kinda funny so so yeah that's really cool and we're doing a second Club this time with iJustine and we're finally doing the premiere versus Final Cut Pro editing challenge oh yeah interest so so is teryn still editing teryn so this has a ton of moving pieces yeah guys don't blame any of these people if they don't end up participating there's a thousand reasons why someone might end up having to bail and it's like I'm sure it's nothing personal because everyone wants to participate but this is like the greatest crossover since you know okay yeah The Avengers meets Superman or whatever alright okay so it's gonna be me you're editing no I'm just like hosting okay that's always like what me Taryn oh Willy does it matter they're confirmed but like I already say oh I don't even know all of them that like just hearing no ah well he doesn't watch mine she'll know yeah okay I'll just mention one okay I'll just mention one so I'll be there Taryn will be there Justine will be there Nico from corridor digital oh it's planning to be there what is he gonna edit on he's not editing oh uh can I can can I mention whose video they're editing No oh okay oh okay so I can't mention that okay whatever the point is the mixer it's gonna be freaking awesome anyway it's gonna be awesome so it turns out I'm gonna be out of town because saving time that's alright with Kyle I don't remember the name of it for whatever reason yeah but he used to have a segment awesomesauce oh I know that forever Kyle segment egg TV that awesome part they play I think is normally counter strike against each other yeah but they have these cards that they can play against each other that are like nerd sporty style oh really like handicaps yeah you have to like where Hulk hands and I'm gonna like kill you for a while in counter-strike and it was used to love watching those so while you're down there wait did you say Kyle yeah oh I didn't know he did that yeah oh yeah a hundred percent huh because he would go against white goo sauce that was their whole thing oh I'm guessing Nick is here to promote an ltte store.com promo is that why you're here alright what do we have this week we have not done the intro yet to the show but that's okay we can do your promo first geez oh wow so we've gone and put this shot at the very top of the store that was very helpful and considerate of us should we put some what should we put a different picture as the first one yeah maybe like what do you think this one this one no no I know but maybe just like you know just a shot of like underwear instead of me half naked yeah we can do that I mean we don't have to if you just want to look at that every time you go to LTT store calm you probably go there more than anyone else I think there are a lot of people that go there more from the idea they appreciate it very much do they all right fair enough fair enough really so guys the promo this week is buy a 3-pack of underwear and get an LTTE water bottle for $9.90 really is that what you said because it's a percentage thing in the back end they can't do points okay supposed to be ten bucks but you know what the disk dimes off on me yeah so buy underwear get water bottle it's it kind of makes sense for us to promote the underwear because we just got another shipment so we've got a big shipment and we've seen a real pattern in the underwear where people buy one package and then they come back and buy two more packages because nine is the right number of underwear to have if you do your laundry every week get it buying packages sorry I'll move on no oh Willy really I don't know we'll see I did read the email I just read it at the beginning of the week my it's in and it's out Nick it's in in it's out all right so our main topics today are AMD ascendant Verizon 939 50x reviews are in and the 3990 x has elite project nightingale google apparently collected the health records of 50 million Americans without you do yeah that's my gastic I was actually on bit Wits page trying to find those videos which I don't think he's done them in a while so unless you may be imagined them I don't think I did but maybe folks if they're not like super performing well on channel or something which is maybe why he killed it I don't know I'm not sure or ran out of ideas I have no idea maybe I ran out of ideas Apple launching 16 inch MacBook Pro with a new old better keyboard also the Motorola RAZR foldable phone for fifteen hundred bucks yeah we'll talk about that for sure after the intro though by temporarily [Music] [Music] I just try it it's not there we're whispering that's pretty neat yeah uh-huh that's weird yahweh's how is the stream on on twitch and full playing oh yeah we're so on YouTube it says video output low and it says we're live but it says the stream health is oh lordy it set to unlisted well we'll go ahead and set that live now burp Iturbe alright so why don't we move right into the that's my but the big thing that happened this week I mean obviously a lot of you guys watching out there would have already watched our review of the 3950 X did you watch our review 3950 XO you need an upgrade dude yeah yeah it's like I can't play it's great I can't play the new Cod and stream at the same no you can't not without a 3950 X you can't well I don't know if I necessarily need that but I can't with my current process only $1,000 for a CPM Canadian Canadian 750 us I don't want and that's assuming you can find one because these things are gonna be moving like hotcakes it is so fast that it keeps up with Intel in lightly threaded like single threaded gaming situations and it's got 16 cores it has 16 cores and the thing is it's funny because compared to other parts of AMD's lineup it actually doesn't look like a great value so compared to the 3900 X although again that's assuming that you can even find the thing in stock here let's go ahead and 3900 X I think that's around 500 bucks yeah so five hundred and thirty bucks assuming you can you can find stock of it you know the the 39 50 X doesn't look like a great deal cuz it's like another two hundred and fifty dollars like you're paying another fifty percent more for just thirty percent more course right so you could look at the thing you could go oh well this thinks this thing sucks it's a bad bargain but then when you compare it to a Intel's lineup so let's go grab you know let's grab Intel's flagship consumer CPU the ninety nine hundred KS special edition what that thing's not thousand dollars whatever even forget it Amazon yeah okay so let's look at the nine nine hundred K four hundred and eighty bucks well I was only got eight course so now all of a sudden if you compare AMD's top-of-the-line to Intel stuff it looks like a downright bargained 581 for the 581 for the chaos on Amazon new egg was derping they must just be out of stock and not people to order it or something maybe they don't know if when their next allocation is coming or something like that but like that's incredible yeah like when you have a flagship grade product and it still looks like a bargain compared to your competitor mind you that's their competitors you know flagship product or whatever but even if we look at like a 9700 K or something like that like that's more like what people actually buy so that's you know eight cores without multi-threading or hyper threading excuse me as Intel code without SMT okay so that's eight course for three hundred and nineteen bucks but they're slower course yeah and no SMT so like 39 50x looks like like like an almost you know linear price to performance increase depending on what you're doing so there's a lot of things that aren't gonna benefit from having 16 cores in a desktop and there are a lot of things that do benefit from multi-core things from multiple cores like if you wanted to run a bunch of VMs or something where dual channel memory might end up actually being a problem or running out of PCI Express Lanes because if you've got all these VMs ready might want to pass through devices you might actually have a lot of things plugged in but for the like the light workstation you know the the uber workstation light Edition yeah this thing looks incredible and it games like a beast yeah so I am pretty excited about that that wasn't really in my notes I was just kind of this is an extension of how happy I was in my review unlike the flip of the coin that I'll bring out this my processor would be very expensive but it is also five generations old and if I wasn't streaming it has no problem with the new card or anything else so yes and my dad has a processor that is seven generations old and wasn't way too expensive when it came out actually no that's not true because he got an upgrade from from you for doing the plumbing thing so he's still running that process okay that one oh that's still usually just fine yeah okay that's it's not so yeah isn't played the most pushing games but it's it he doesn't have any problems with it so that is an argument that you can make is that while AMD has certainly made great strides yeah a lot of what they did was make up for sitting on their butts for yeah you know the better part of a decade but and what's really cool is that dr. Hsu has I mean I don't want to use the word confirmed because CEOs have definitely made promises and not managed to deliver on them in the past but has said that the next generation of Rison is gonna come out next year yeah and like first half of the year yeah so not only have they made up for that decade of thumb sitting there like still gone I find that Intel right now I'm like I'm not freaking out but think you guys got to understand it's just giant multi-billion dollar company and even if Intel's performance was half of AMD's I don't think AMD has the fab capacity even to supply the entire computer industry with processors so like Intel will have customers from time no matter what because AMD is relying not only just on a third party so they're relying on tsmc to make their processors so it's not just that but also it's also the fact that TSMC like has other customers so they they're not in control of their destiny and their destiny is definitely not to have 100% of TSM sees output so Intel's fab output just from like a sheer if you stop thinking about CPUs from like a passionate enthusiast perspective and if you think about them as the commodities that they are for most people for being honest yeah at the end of the day if there's only so much rubber on earth you know tired manufacturer B is always going to have customers to sell to as long as the Earth's demand for rubber exceeds the supply that tire manufacturer a can output period so it's not like Intel's in danger of going out of business or anything like that but if I'm in the enthusiast division there for example I'm a real upset because I'm gonna start seeing you know my quarterly sales bonuses drop and stuff like that I mean that's one of the ways that a company as large as Intel manages to sort of not lose track of where their targets and where their goals are from like an individual business unit perspective is making sure that there's a carrot and a stick at sort of every different level of its data center or consumer or enthusiast or whatever the case may be yeah speaking of the sort of the bigger chips one of the big leaks this week was of course MSI accidentally confirming the existence of a thread per thread Ripper 3990 X with 64 cores and 128 threads now this was rumored already and then I had kind of wondered if they were gonna do it because they launched the 24 core and the 32 core which from from my perspective were already so much stronger than the 16 core on the am4 platform that they could have they could have carried that platform on their own I mean from working at retail the or not at retail because that implies I was like a salesperson on the floor which I was but this is not what I'm talking about but working at a retailer and the product management side of things what I can tell you guys is that you know if if Intel or AMD launches a platform so here's your here's your motherboard you know good better best from a soos MSI gigabyte asrock blah blah blah etc and then here's this whole stack of processors you know like six different CPUs 50% of the sales are usually like two boards so whatever the standard ATX like decent one is from you know the vendor that's doing really well this generation and then like the similar one from like one of the other vendors and then your next one is going to be like a really solid board that's like ma T X or something like that and then the rest is like everything else is kind of like drags and it's the same over on the CPU side there's one or two that clearly outsell everything else and are like 50 to 80% of the total sales for that entire platform and then there's like everything else so they so they build out this whole product stack in order to make sure that they are meeting the needs of a variety of customers and then they they balance which ones they're actually delivering to the market based on consumer feedback by intentionally in a lot of cases intentionally crippling chips that could have been something better and selling them as something lesser and then of course that's where core I'm walking and overclocking and like you know in graphics cards you know firmware flashing cards an example it's where all that turned over because back down to treating it like a commodity which is what all these companies are doing at the thousand foot level you might think as a consumer well that's crazy why would AMD take a graphics card that they could sell as a Vegas 64 or a CPU that they could sell as a 39 50 X so these are both you know top tier fully enabled chips why would they sell them as a 3900 X with only 12 core so you got four and for disabled and and then a vega 56 with some of the functional units disabled why on earth would they do that surely they could get more money selling them like flake for that much it's like yeah but there's a limit there's a limit to the customers who are gonna buy this and you're better off capturing this customer then ignoring this customer and so a lot of the time the costs of a particular item end up blended right so they subsidize the cost of this one with like the extra money that they're making on this one and as long as they're maintaining overall profitability and they're doing a good job of maintaining their product stack in a way that kind of makes sense for consumers and retailers then it's all hunky-dory it doesn't matter if they're only making get 5 percent on this one but making 28 percent on this one as long as for all the vega's or all the Bryson's they're selling they're making an average of you know 15 20 points or whatever the case may be probably more than that now that people actually want their chips pretty cool so I'm potentially thinking of upgrading next I've been thinking about doing this system for a while you're gonna end up going eh India which they're gonna expect me to get a system for you and make a video about it aren't you yeah right so I'm kind of thinking of sort of making like the the a few years ago this would be really weird computer and I'm thinking of trying to wait until Intel drops a GPU and then going Li AMD cpu intel GPU the unthinkable computer how interesting I think it could be kind of cool I kind of like it yeah I don't know if you can wait that long yeah games train three times a week as far as I can tell you abhorrent I haven't for like a long time because I like drank an insane amount of water before I came here well it's gonna suffer some trying to knock off I've been sick for like ever yeah I've been basically weeks not streaming for a very long time but yeah generally god you will yeah and then when it's time to stream you can't yeah and he's dead great yeah so yeah that it is a bit of a problem but I don't know I don't want to upgrade right now so we'll see okay the ends at gesture gesture excuse me brings up a really good point sometimes those components of the GPU or those course on the CPU or some of the cache for example is actually defective or sometimes it works but it doesn't meet the thermal or power consumption targets or whatever the case may be or you know the voltage targets and that is why it ends up being a lower tier processor you are 100% right and if the company plays their cards perfectly then they will have exactly the defect rate and exactly the pricing strategy that makes it so that the demand for those products exactly meets the defect rate and everything is perfectly balanced but in the real world what they usually end up doing is erring on the side of disabling good ones in order to make sure that they're meeting the market demand and trying to build as many good ones as they can versus building a strategy around them mostly being defective yeah they're like you're never going to get the exact perfect yields for the the structure and product stack that you want to have a little bit especially as time goes on like don't imagine for a second that once you know AMD designs the 3950 X they're just like okay well good job everyone all the time they are constantly tweaking and tuning and trying to get those yields up because the thing is on a silicon wafer the more usable chips they get the less waste and the more profit they can get from that way for it cost I'm not gonna say exactly the same amount but it costs what it costs for each wafer regardless of how many chips they get so if you look at I mean a very extreme example of this would be something like a red camera we're on a manufacturing wafer they're gonna get you know however many sensors but it might take them and I don't know what their yields are like and you know what for all we know every single one of them is good and they're just marking them up because haha you know you la capitalism yeah or whatever but odds are that cameras for example are so expensive because the tolerance to defects is so low because you can't have a dead pixel on a twenty thousand thirty fifty thousand dollar camera so the tolerance to defects is so low and therefore the yields are so low that they might have to do they not have to do multiple runs before they get a working freakin sensor and so that's why a chip can cost anywhere from cents you know for something where you can put hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them on a wafer you know something like a motherboard chipset and we're like all gonna come out just fine yeah tolerances are huge make it like a bluetooth chipset or something stupid like that down to something that is you know enormous like Nvidia's the top tier Turing GPUs the thing is freaking huge so you can get some a chip that's like it's all fundamentally sort of similar it's a microprocessor but that costs anywhere from pennies all the way up to hundred and hundreds or thousands of dollars when they're all made out of fundamentally the same thing they're all made out of glass right all right why don't we move on to our next topic here shall we oh my god it's flipped around someone in the twitch chat just called me Alex oh wow no this is not Alex this is me you can tell from his slightly both blue eye both got kind of flippy hair both kind of blondish both facial hair ah Luke's facial hair is darker oh well that'll be your cue Oh Apple they finally did it they launched a 16 inch MacBook Pro with a new keyboard that's actually the old one that's actually closer to the old keyboard than it is to be bored all right so Apple Apple's just like I don't get it Apple saw the sonic redesign it was like we can do this too we can go back to what it was supposed to be I actually haven't seen that yet I do need to look at it so it's way better yeah okay oh it's that freaky weird astronomically super freaky weird alright anyway anyway back to Apple launching until they did this weird thing that they do every once in a while where even though they actually just had an event a little while ago and then pointedly did not announce a 16 inch MacBook Pro when everyone was kind of expecting it they just like waited what is it a couple weeks two or three weeks and then just like do quietly put it up on their website and we're like yep I okay am I being unreasonable when I say that that really makes me mad because they would never launch an iPhone like that why is the Mac such a second-class citizen that's fair I think in a way they knew this would happen what would happen I didn't need to raise my finger so people can see I'm pointing at the laptop oh no it's fine it's fine just there would be articles made about it we would what it here reviewers gonna talk about thing it's not gonna launch silently why not launch an iPhone like that's exactly my point like why why why treat certain things like they are deserving of attention and other things like I don't know is it be cut maybe Apple has like in an internal formula that they use to determine whether they do a big launch event or whether they like there's there was stuff launched at their event that was more boring than this it wasn't just the iPhone yeah well no no they had a second event since the iPhone event I forget what they even launched because it was utterly uninteresting remember I cannot oh Aaron air pods Pro oh watched ok they're really good ok but they could have just bundled it with this yes but that's my point is they could have easily one else easily like here's the thing guys I mean they're working on something like a new MacBook Pro for many many moons many moons it's not like it was a surprise to them that like two weeks from now that this is gonna be launching it's not like they were like oh are we gonna launch this or are we not like when they're that close to release when they can actually put it up on the website they could have easily said ok availability in two weeks so anyway it just outright replaces the 15 inch model in Apple's lineup because basically it's just like less bezel which is sweet it replaces the a justifiably hated butterfly key switch design with their old scissor design that's also found in the desktop magic keyboard which was good they brought back the Escape key to be clear like I when I was more in the keyboard enthusiast community some people used to be into those Apple desktop keyboards I didn't like it but they were into it and honestly when typing on one I'm like okay this is a good experience I don't prefer it but it is a good experience and then they ditched it it's so they added a 100 watt hour battery which is the maximum allowed on planes by the FAA which gives a laptop 11 hours of battery life the 15-inch had just 10 and you can configure it with up to 64 gigs of RAM up to 8 terabytes of storage eight core core online CPU and a Radeon probe 55 Ken Nvidia and Apple just buried the hatchet are they ever going to I think if they do it would possibly require a new CEO not at in video because that's never gonna happen someday it might have to I guess not for a forever while unless he can use you AI inferencing to with that leather jacket he could be just super villain looking enough to do it yeah I guess you should figure it out I could by Jensen as a super villain yeah yeah I could get into that I could definitely see that I like controls the tech and all the cars so 2,400 bucks and goes up to six grand Wow yep that's a lot that's honestly with an eight terabyte high-performance nvme Drive that's a lot of it that's fair cuz you got to remember this is not wonder how much that exact add-on costs yeah oh it's like $2,400 yeah like over top of the base model if I'm like you don't really need that I don't like it the vast majority of people are not gonna need I have a hard time imagining and I know I'm gonna if someone's gonna clip this and they're gonna like make me eat my words in ten or twenty years or whatever the case may be 64 kilobytes of RAM yeah sure yeah I can't imagine a reason to have 8 terabytes of storage on a laptop now maybe in the future what for I don't know honestly but that's what life that's what people would say so II back ok no Cod is a hundred and fifty gigs you're not playing Cod on this I'm just saying file sizes increase right it's a finding that happens Cod has gone up 3x in size in whatever many years which is spiffy good for you go play your cod you sword wielding shotgun firing wanker but that's not what we're talking about this is not a device it's not a gaming device yeah ok but but data for media is also increasing barely we're gonna get into eight okay we are we are at the physical limit of what you can do with a cellphone camera you can't you cannot keep putting bigger sensors in them because no one Apple included is willing to make their phones larger yeah you can't pack more pixels into them because there's no benefit not because you can't keep making a little fog rafi smaller you might be able to are we currently doing simultaneous raw and not raw video I know they're doing that with photos okay raw video I guess I'm just saying there's like yes and go but that is such a nice use case and there is no reason that that file couldn't be on external storage yeah oh yeah no I definitely give it that part I mean literally king of the dongles like storage dongle there's no reason to have it internal to have it potentially lost when your motherboard dies and your t2 chip makes it so that your lot of your data can't be restored yeah like that is so many eggs in a portable basket I just cannot fathom it and I know there's gonna be digital artists out there that are like okay well what about if I want you know I work eight hours a day entire scene and whatever whatever whatever else again I sure I guess we can do that and obviously Apple can do it for me the magic number really was one terabyte on a mobile device yeah as actually I was probably before that as soon as we hit 512 I was like you should crave more cuz they're like I just brought up the argument if you work eight hours a day and like I know an artist that works more than eight hours a day a lot of the time yeah but they do like Photoshop single image the stuff so there's isn't that huge yeah but even if you did video and video editing yeah I'm Josh should more like you should be offloading your stuff I'm talking about more like 3d animation no totally yeah like but you should who are floating your projects like they shouldn't live on only you're loud especially with what we were saying yes very soon especially with what a piece of garbage finder is you can like how hard it is to organize things yeah you can do it but be honest do you because if you are doing a proper job of organizing your digital life you probably aren't storing everything on your Mac oh yeah yeah and like it's especially if it is for work which is I'm inspecting that argument was gonna come up which is why I dressed it especially if it is for work because you don't want a single point of failure you want like three so you should be offloading this somewhere then that somewhere should deduplicate to other places and send it all over the world Oh access today basically it's awesome Oh also we accidentally weren't streaming on YouTube at the beginning of the show so I should probably no I don't think that was your bad I think it was no no that was me I said that last week wait no I didn't I don't know why it was that but I should check it you know what I think use the other thing last week by a pack of LT t underwear a three pack of LT 2 underwear I'm so sorry I will put a different picture there it's not much better here we go there we go buy a pack of LT t underwear and get an LT t water bottle for just 10 bucks with your order so go ahead and add the underwear to your cart then the water bottle will show up for both of them to your cart and the water bottle will show up for $20 off actually I think it's nine dollars and ninety cents because apparently discounts have to be done by percent to eight okay it doesn't matter alright we've got time for one more topic before I we have to we started the show so late and we also said we were gonna talk oh wow okay um join me do one more ah yeah the project nightingale yeah no no no that's fine yeah we really want to talk about the reason you know what Luke I'll call you I am sweet my babysitter starting for early today and I totally forgot so this is gonna be something a little unconventional I'm gonna call into my own show yeah and yeah this is awesome therapy I'm gonna I'm gonna check the chat to see what people think about the how it sounds I just need to find my backpack and then I'll call back in if you want to just start project angle about me that's cool okay I just want to see what Chad says real quick no one's saying anything so I'm not sure I wish we had one before perfect okay so I'm gonna do project nightingale I guess before we do the razor foldable phone so a project nightingale was Google collecting the health records of 50 million Americans without their knowledge a bombshell report by The Wall Street Journal exposed Google project nightingale an initiative by Google to collect all of that stuff the data includes names birthdays addresses family members allergies immunizations radiology scans hospitalization records and you know all the rest of everyone's complete medical history the data was provided by st. louis-based ascension one of the biggest health companies in the u.s. in exchange for you're not even on the phone right now I don't need to do that in exchange for secure management of patient data and and the provision of tools to improve clinical quality and patient safety rule says the initiative is completely legal and they are also working on similar arrangements with dozens of other health care providers also known as we don't care what you think we're doing it anyways for the furthermore google says patient data cannot and will not be combined with any consumer data but now the US government specifically the office for civil rights in the Department of Health and Human Services is investigating project Nightingale to ensure they're following regulations this sounds really bad that these are the opinion notes not the notes from the meeting but the opinion notes that I don't know who they were written by this is not my opinion says this sounds really bad on paper but maybe we need a central database of medical information it's better than waiting for doctors to send files directly to each other and then the next note says what's the worst that could happen in my opinion the worst that could happen is pretty terrible because ii like insurance companies and stuff get a hold of this they could change your insurance rates based on whatever the doctor says and they would have more leeway to do that and i mean you know all the time this is like the DNA sequencing stuff 23 it's called all those other things there's a big reason to not do it which is they sell all that information so your insurance premium like ideally I actually don't know it super well all I know is that they do definitely sell that information oh you like buy this kit and as far as I know you like spit into a vial thing and then you ship it off and then they send you information about like who you might be related to and what medical issues you might have and etc etc are super cheap suspiciously cheap to the point where it's pretty obvious that what they're doing is they're harvesting the data and they're selling it the worst part is that by participating in this you're not only putting your own information out there and our risk of being obtained by something you might not want to have it your all putting your family at the same risk because let's say for example all of my siblings for mark on Amazon and now all of a sudden whoever buys that data can make a pretty darn good guess about me even though I have never actually submitted any DNA for testing yep pretty lame so I give me one second yeah so the worst that could happen is like it all your stuff could get sold I'm not necessarily against a a central repository of medical information but I think if that happens it should be managed by the government Google I don't know yeah yep that's very true I don't know necessarily what they need to do but this doesn't seem like it for secure data they probably have that for certain military things oh yeah just like like you know never specifically or anything but I am so sorry that they do it's not even gonna guess yeah yeah so like doing that for medical doesn't even seem like that much of a stretch to be honest exactly especially in the states okay moving on one more topic Motorola RAZR exactly yeah Motorola RAZR foldable phone unveiled I'm just gonna go through the notes quick and then I'll set you loose it's been leaked to high heck already but Motorola unveiled its modern revamp of the classic razor flip phone on Wednesday night I will show it to you guys in a moment when I'm done reading the notes it's got a 6.2 inch flexible display and a 2.7 inch secondary display visible when the phone is folded so like the the screen on the top there's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 a mid-range CPU from 2018 six gigabytes of RAM 128 gigabytes of storage 25:10 milliamp hour battery it's USB C based Android 9pi apparently it's going to upgrade to Oreo later no specific date Motorola has apparently addressed the dust and debris in Jess issues and it's coming January 2020 for $1,500 I'll show it to you guys now and what - go ahead why folding screen phones particularly right now just make absolutely no sense because something like the latest iPhone their water resistance their dust resistance their drop resistance the hinge on the galaxy old is starting to be a little bit wiggly wobbly not much but like it's not perfect anymore like there's so much to go I mean there's a reason that for the longest time the trend in mobile devices was towards making them have fewer moving parts not more and fewer points of ingress not more but by and large I really like the idea of something it has a big screen but then folds up small in my pocket well I get kind of lost on this one the unfolded screen yeah and I I will throw them a bone here by saying that they they fix the crease issue I this video doesn't have the animation for it but there's a different video that shows like like a cut view of the phone unfolding and the way that they manage the fold is by like they it doesn't pinch at any real point it just kind of curves even more so when it gets unfolded there's no crease it's a very seamless looking screen I think it looks fantastic in that way so I want to make sure they have that bone throwed in towards them but yeah all the other folding phones you're like massively increasing your screen real estate with this one you're going from extremely little to a normal amount is that you have to have a bag for it whether it's a messenger bag or a backpack it doesn't fit in your pants and then when you go down to a phone it fits in your pants so it's like for me device classes rather than being defined by the diagonal size of their screen in inches or wherever else are defined by how you carry them and it was always that was always my problem with the iPad people who are pitching it as like this mobile revolution I'm like yeah if by mobility you mean going upstairs and downstairs in your house like for a while people are trying to do it but it's it's a joke so to consider an iPad something that you actually carry around with you everyday just use a laptop like if you have actual work to do you're using a laptop by the way if you put you know a type cover on your iPad if the laptop so you know congratulations [Music] yeah yeah last gen hardware not having Oreo on it yet there's just some things yeah there's there's some things that just kind of seem a little weird about it that don't make me super excited I actually kind of like the idea of an option for a much smaller in your pocket phone i I could see people going flat I don't necessarily really care but I could definitely see people going for that would be for me for sure I also think a big drawback is it's 1,500 bucks yeah like it's really expensive that's a lot I think there's gonna be a nostalgia factor for people with just the name understand this bears about as much resemblance to the original RAZR as like I don't know how do I even compare this as like you know uh modern Ford f-150 does a Durango to a Model T but the same company it's not the same people making it it's it's an extremely different phone an extremely different remember it may be something so someone in Chad said screen isn't gonna get scratched in your pocket I mean it still has a screen on the one side and when's the last time you had a modern phones in your pocket yeah the first thing I did with my switch when I bought it was I bought a like little tempered glass screen protector thing to throw on my on my switch that costs like almost nothing and they it was a pack of two just like a whole horde of them it's supposed to be you know you're fashionistas like but the original Motorola RAZR where it was like a super trendy phone those people take a lot of pictures then upload them to Instagram these days I can guarantee you I haven't haven't seen the phone no-one's seen the phone as far as I know but I can guarantee you the camera on this thing sucks because Motorola hasn't made a single good mobile camera and especially in a phone a form factor like this where they're gonna be more thickness constrained I am not imagining for a second that the camera is gonna somehow being you know a paradigm shift quantum leap forward for them yeah so random thing that I looked up a pixel 3 as a newer operating system in a newer CPU it has a little bit less memory I'll give you that much and I think you can buy it with the same amount of storage but I'm not sure that's 600 bucks so you could buy one and if the screen got scratched you just throw it away and buy another one and still save money sorry there's a pixel 3 so it's why it's one jab at pixel 4 is a little bit too expensive you'd still save a lot of money buying a pixel 4 yeah but you could also just go to a shop and get the screen replaced for nothing and save a lot of money so yeah that is not the that is not a very relevant argument I would say I feel like I genuinely feel like flipping and open is gonna feel cool oh yeah I used to love that yeah I used to love my flip phone more than last gen that's the thing is the processor on the pixel 3 is notably better than this it's a generation beyond in Snapdragon architecture yeah so we're mid-range and a generation behind last year's pixel all right what the heck man but yeah I think that's it for the show I'm gonna cover Super chats because this is gonna be the first time that I don't forget to do them by myself are you gonna hang around for Super chats you're gonna take off all right let's do this give me a sec someone asked is the Samsung CR g9 the best 49 inch gaming monitor has been restored that's so cool actually I'm down a lot of people sending money from their google opinions rewards thank you thanks yeah hey guys from the UK love the videos and thanks you move got me into PC bowling that's cool yeah thanks for the content to do apparently they're having issues with the floatplane app for Android there's lots of updates actually coming out very recently they're taking a very long time to propagate so like when we launch a new update they don't all immediately go to your phone and I'm not sure exactly how it selects it it seems like it's supposed to happen in downtime which is generally overnight but we found that it's taking like many days to actually propagate updates to everyone so I don't know but it is slowly but surely sending these updates out so eventually hopefully you'll get some updates that will fix some things Jaden's been hard at work fixing a lot of different bugs on the app yeah he's actually also working on that right now [Music] I'm getting the Razer core X and 2060s opinion please neat I'm not sure yeah I don't know Shroud collab video when someone's asking someone else hey why nuke I'm building a game dev PC should I wait for Black Friday Cyber Monday or are they likely to be out of stock little short answer is absolutely also I'm assuming the line of stock tips is going to have a Black Friday video yeah I don't necessarily not always a guarantee but yeah do [Music] sorry I'm just skipping through some of these don't know who else to give these super chats to perfect that's exactly what I want to hear hey I was watching your 10 gig home Network video Congrats on the upgrade did Jake use shielded connectors on your cat 6a cable he didn't mention the grounding wire in his mini tutorial hey guys I built my first PC and ran I 264 stress test Rison 526 hundred plus stock cooler PC turned off at 85 to 90 degrees Celsius is this normal yeah and make sure you don't have like the little plastic thing covering the bottom of the stock cooler if it is there I'm not sure on that one in particular to do generally enjoying your videos love how you've been a trailblazer turning YouTube legit respectful business keep it up that was from Jordan thank you very much Jordan would you be okay with me making a fan game of LTT for my project in my game development unit yeah and I think like try to keep the integrity of the people in it if you're using yeah people you know perfect yeah you got to get the padalka donk in there bronson eagle says love you guys keep up the great work thank you very much Cory says what happened to the team face pins put some pressure on them you can message the LCC store comm support email and be like hey I'd like to buy one they're so cool oh here we go k someone answered my question he said hey Luke this serious with Kyle was called stack attack and that's totally correct because you had this stack of cards that you could like play against the other person then it gave them a handicap yeah you guys should play stack attack I actually really enjoyed watching those I don't know how well they did so I'm not sure what the response to hey we should do stack attack would be but yeah $50 donation from someone named very unemployed which is an interesting combination he says as an architect and gamer 20 80 TI worth it or should I wait for a price drop when the new models drop and then you start to show up 30 I or whatever the case may be cost every upgrades which is in the long term a lot cheaper than you know having it drop by 50% each generation or whatever the case may be if you're not staying on top of it I used to do when I was young and poor and stuff and I think GPUs would probably especially be a good example of that which is where like honestly upgrading every generation but doing it with proper cadence is very possibly a better way to do it than waiting the like three to four that most people do that just going through more of them now great videos as usual is secret shopper dead though we are hoping to bring it back next year with a new secret agent and a new co-host it will it be I don't know if you want to disclose this will it be the same thing are you gonna be buying full PCs from system integrators again or are you gonna be buying something else oh my goodness Brendon Stubbs sent a ton of super chats at least four that all say this light handed off light hearted offhand comments yes don't say oh yeah that would be hilarious please do that someone said yeah money for Luke that's not how this works but thank you very much yeah if I even do it because I'm not sure how long my voice is gonna hold up but maybe loving the new hairstyle - I see you've gone oh right you are now a broom with a sharpie face on it by the way lots of comments about the the broom replacing Linus yeah there's a broom with your with a little smiley face on it I'm not a Terran did something I don't know oh no no yeah there's an actual like like straw broom here I don't know where he got it from someone's shouting out a game but I've never heard of it so I'm not gonna say the name just a case or something weird because a lot of weird games these days are going to have an LTTE winter hat / - right make sense super pumped for LTX 2020 living out our lives to be in the tech gods tech geeks paradise yeah sweet is buying and selling you CPUs a thing yeah oh yeah the safest components to buy and sell used yeah even even motherboards because motherboards do die so like if you if you keep a relatively old motherboard for probably like roughly two three generations and then try to flip it if it still works you can make pretty good money because the series will be more common and the motherboards will not it's actually really funny cuz like motherboards have this weird value curve where they go way down and then way up and it only started happening recently like in the last five to six years because CPU performance wasn't changing really dramatically so that we're he's old but like still perfectly good processors out there and no motherboards to install ermine yeah that said I think the way that AMD is pushing performance forward right now is gonna mean a big drop-off in value for old ports compared to what we've been used to seeing over the past half I think that makes sense I think it might be stemmed a little bit by the the software side not necessarily mirroring the performance improvement but the hype is definitely there so I think you will have at least a bit of an impact any update on the glow-in-the-dark this is the last Super chat any update on the glow-in-the-dark consolations shirt experiment so far I will be giving it a little bit more time you know I don't want to draw my conclusions too early because if we're gonna change something as beloved as constellations we want to make sure that we're changing it for the better right now right this sorry I lied there are more Super chats the the Super chat window was like glitching out and wasn't showing them all and I'm definitely gonna end here though cuz I have to go home eventually but Ryan Ryan says sandals butts echo is an Ecco right yeah I don't really have a solid recommendation to be honest I mean let me just see I think I still have my my old pair that lasted a lot better I'm trying to figure out what model it is it's hard to say [Music] powered by receptor technology I don't know like how hard is it for shoes to just like have a proper yeah shoe models are rough sometimes I think a Nike does okay with it but yeah and then the last one is luke this money would be yours if your pc could handle streaming oof just shots fired shots fired but okay guys thank you guys for coming we'll see you next week we're gonna roll the intro [Music] I can't believe how random this was someone brought like the world's tiniest Apple box which is some IKEA thing and I stacked that with the comic book box on top of it and then put the phone on top of that okay no one's really complaining so I think it's not great but it's like fine yay Squarespace comic garage all right thank you guys see you later
