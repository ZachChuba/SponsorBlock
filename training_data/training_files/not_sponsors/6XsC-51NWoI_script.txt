all right so we got to be on the lookout for a bobcat because one ran across the road earlier just things in Texas that happen wouldn't that be great hit a bobcat oh we can see how this holds up against Bobcats yeah that's the blob boy Bobcat tests gonna have to add that to our list [Music] all right welcome back everybody today we have a slightly misleading car you're looking at is not a GT 350 it's not Shelby it's not Shelby it's just a regular regular Mustang GT but it has a lot of aftermarket parts to look like it's been pretty DUP a Shelby but don't be fooled it is just a 2017 Mustang GT let's point out the things that are aftermarket so people aren't confused okay this steering wheel carbon fiber wrapped on the top and bottom it's a square Bob definitely Ephrem are definitely aftermarket and it's so aftermarket that the horn no longer works yeah that's weird it's a weird quirk this is not safe to drive because of that yeah I guess you go is Rev exactly this is what you saw you have to do a weird thing where you got a life shifted in a neutral six weird tidal shift paddle shifters they're weird aftermarket red shifters and they just look cool but they're giant and they're gonna wear a super well you have to press down here where the paddle shifters actually are one of the aftermarket stuff is on the exterior of this car there's not like a ton of white on here get wing yeah a front splitter the chin all that definitely saves you a lot of money yeah I feel like I mean so the Mustang g/t is about $35,000 I don't know how much he put into aftermarket parts but then the Shelby gt350 is like 60 and he's like yeah it's like 50 it's like around 60 yeah yeah he probably didn't put $20,000 in aftermarket parts into this I doubt it I mean none of them are performance parts it's just for looks so if you're cool with how the Mustang GT performs and you can save yourself a lot of money if you just want the looks at the 350 [Music] three-two-one [Music] there's succeed every fan feels fast yeah yeah yeah that one it's a much more tame than I would have expected out of it is actually that's a a little smooth that's not that monster they say it doesn't just hit you all at once it pulls you and then you catches the next year then it pulls you again it's very linear each time yeah nothing unpredictable it's actually yeah the shifts were pretty smooth on that and that was in the automatic that was in the automatic that was the automatic launch 260 from a dead stop good it was a good little rush but it's not scary it's not it doesn't misbehave you're always in control yup let's try it manual [Music] sixteen that's how you do it Wow that was fun that I would I'm not gonna complain about the the paddle shifters that much yeah they're not bad I still would prefer to have a like like actress stick transmission but paddles are fine they're still very capable if you want to do that what do you think about like the bass GT I mean just like bass Mustangs maybe in general it's alright we see a lot of a lot of them here in Texas I think they're a little underwhelming in their looks department oh yeah I do think this whole recent generation of Mustangs is the best looking they've done since I think 60s yeah I think you mean sounds like they first city came out yeah I think I'd probably agree with that I do really like how the new ones look yeah and especially how they sound I really do dig the v8 the only other most thing that we've driven so far was the EcoBoost for Sylvia the EcoBoost 4-cylinder and that was still fast and felt good it wasn't Lea surprised plus yes it was a pleasant surprise but the engine noise leaves a little bit to be desired yeah this answers that yeah it's definitely salts that this engine sounds very good nice and growly just we'd expect from a Mustang [Music] yeah that is so just like that it because an angry angry little monster I love this thing Interiors we're busing specifically suffers a lot I think that's forward for you that I complained about this with the four-cylinder EcoBoost Mustang but this even though this is like a step above it's a trim above the interior still very very cheap feeling yeah especially I mean when you can go out and like my Volkswagen Golf my 2019 Golf has a better interior than this and it's cheaper oh yeah definitely so that's frustrating I mean I guess to put this kind of performance in a muscle car that's relatively affordable you do have to cut corners some yeah I understand that and this is where they cut the corners is in the interior like everything is very plasticy I mean there's some fake carbon-fiber bits which I appreciated or aftermarket yeah it's kind of it's an underwhelming interior by and see yeah it depends what you want whether you want like crazy fast performance or interior luxury yeah I know you have to cut corners and it's hard to have both and keep this price because this is like I said it's about $35,000 that's a great deal what is a great deal for the performance you get and I know for needs to cut corners somewhere the performance is great the noise is great but the interior has to suffer I feel like because of that yeah it does it does I would say it's a fair trade in a muscle car yeah yeah I mean you can always do like you can always reupholster the inside if you really wanted to I think that's probably a waste of money this yeah very much a weekend toy like the we reviewed I mean that wasn't particularly luxurious either but we didn't care because it was a riot do you think somebody gets this when they're having a midlife crisis this one no why not this one but you do think somebody gets the Corvette this is a young man's car so okay you're saying the type of person that gets this is a millennial yeah I don't know about that I mean if their dad aged people like people our parents age maybe 45 50 years old something like that but those are the people you see driving Mustangs are kids like they're especially yes these are areas it's parents buy these for their children to go to high school because this is what all the high school boys want I suppose the Mustang definitely has like an obnoxious young aggressive driver vibe whereas the Corvette has an entitled obnoxious old driver vibe okay I can see that I guess yeah I do like how much things are sort of like retro inspired be on the inside like the interior does feel almost like it's trying to hark back the legis kind of like 1960s design I can see that I think in a lot of these like just with like your air conditioning vents here it is the gauges here are very old-school style yeah that's all cool and I will say I love the switches down here yeah the switches are nice so I like how the start-stop is bright red I like the gauge cluster it's all very analog except for in the center where you have everything digital where it shows you your fuel economy which is not correct it's only average on this car is 15mpg Hall on premium gas so you're gonna suffer yeah but I don't know if you're ok with blowing a lot of gas and money on your commute I don't know I mean I feel like this is fine too daily yeah I mean I would say enjoy the last few generations of gasoline-powered Mustangs they're ridiculous and loud and expensive to run yes before electrification comes for us all yeah we're gonna probably I think it was 2023 I was reading they want an electric Mustang really yeah and that would be super fast and it'll be it could be really cool could be I would be really real weird yeah we'll see yes just being a good citizen driving the speed limit in my Mustang so JT this is your second time driving a Mustang right yes the first one with the EcoBoost boost so how does this compare first impressions first impressions so far I really like that this one feels more capable it feels more like a sports car than the EcoBoost did obviously it's a GT it's supposed to feel sporty er yeah but the bolsters in this thing are great yeah I forgot to mention that the seats hold you very well yeah it's very snug you don't feel like you get tossed around at all lately the best bolsters I felt in any car yeah you have two back seats then all those seats were designed for like Badgers or something yeah no though the seats are a joke I mean as most cars you assume this that the back seats are not going to be very good I think that compared to other sports cars that we've driven like the Lotus these back seats are not as bad enough but they're more comfortable for sure there are more comfortable they're not a bench they're actual legitimate seats bites still sit back there yeah the trunk is pretty good super yeah it's actually quite spacious I want it to be cramped I could have fit two of me and but I mean I got in there I was comfortable I could work I was comfortable they even have a speaker for you I guess I guess bigger in case you get kidnapped then you can lead jam out to tune kidnap and luxury blasting Old Town Road well I'm getting taken presumably to be shot and buried in the desert but they do have an escape latch that lights up when the trunk closes so you could that's like a front pops up when you hop out probably have to a turn here I go yeah I'm a little worried about taking it too fast I don't trust it for turns it's so heavy and so big I feel like it rolls pretty Elster doesn't want to really lean into that turn yeah I would say no more than like 50 yeah around a decently sharp turn yeah if it's anything more than like a 30 degree turn then you got it take it pretty slowly so what about the how cool this is do you think it must be a chi chi's cool no I don't think a Mustang well people have looked at those people happen here because it's loud well not not only just because of that belay earlier when we were doing the shots of the exterior yeah some guys drove by in his car and like he drove by it and rolled down his window and peeked out nice look back at it okay so it does get looks it is a cool car but there are a lot of them that's true it's common Mustangs are common but it is so pretty cool that doesn't mean it's not cool yeah yeah people things cool then I don't know I think it's a blast I was trying to it's really fun it's alright I think it's so much fun it's as can be quiet and respectable if you put it in normal mode it'll quiet down yeah Wow yeah yeah it's not you being growly that's really quiet it lost all its anger what happened now it's just a normal event there opee yeah I went to Mustang therapy I don't like you now it's a normal calm rational car they can anger again honestly there's not much to a Mustang GT there isn't really a lot in here I feel like I mean everything's pretty it looks cool enough on the outside just German cars man they spoil you I feel like on the interiors yeah German interiors just blow this out of the water but you don't get the amazing so now you don't get it like yeah for an Audi or a Mercedes that's the same price as this like 35 or 40 thousand yeah you're not gonna get the same level of performance and engine noise that this gets so startingly yeah uh I could work so starting us out is performance [Music] eight eight eight eight eight definitely an eight eight I'm gonna give it that high huh I love it I think eight is reserved for more special cars yeah I mean this is like the top of the category of normal car like this is a Mustang GT it's a fast car at the muscle car you can go quickly you're not gonna take it to a track and beat anybody really I think I'm gonna go with the seven that is fair all right next up practica bred to gala t44 yeah yeah not great you know I think I'd probably go with a four - it does have a trunk does that spacious back seat does though - couple doors that's it's terrible fuel economy value strong value cosmos for $35,000 and I mean of course options can add on to that to push this beyond 40 yeah thousand dollars but even still it may not hold its value as well may not be as practical or reliable but you're gonna great performance value yeah for a reasonable price I'm gonna give this I'm gonna give this a seven 7/7 all right I'm gonna give it a slightly low we're at six and a half and then cool factor it's kind of like it's cool people look at it people think it's cool I mean I've noticed cool-looking yeah I've noticed people looking and not everybody know like some other cars we've driven everybody looked at the slingshot lots more people looked at the Audi r8 this is still an above average it's all above average I've given a 6 on the cool factor yeah I think I'd agree with that it's like moderately cool all right next up is quality which is I think Brewer this probably suffers engine quality marks good well yes engine quality good by interior quality is what I rank most on this and it's just not great yeah I would say again for the price you get the Volkswagen or an Audi that's undoubtedly going to have a better interior and you're going to feel more bougie and luxurious and those than you do in this so I don't know I don't want to knock it too bad I'd give this a 4 yeah this does enough for me it's not super luxurious but it does enough I'll give it a 4 and a half actually yeah that's what I was gonna say four and a half this leads us to fun factor for the final final one very fun which is fun I think it's great a blast not I won't say it's as fun as the Corvette though I'd agree with that the Corvette definitely is more fun than this and that's a little bit more fun but this is this is a blast that doesn't get old though that now this is so much fun that's really raw as the Corvette yeah when we're fed is just like an another step up beyond this yeah but then again you're taking more hits on practicality yep to get more fun fair trade so that's the trade-off still though I think I'd probably have to give this like I don't to give this a six and a half that's exactly what I was thinking six and a half on the FF the average grant us out a score is a thirty five point 25 out of sixty I think it's quite good yeah I think this is a great value for anybody looking for a decent sports car or cruiser is do I like to consider them yeah it's a blast not terribly practical but but you know it can be really chill too but it can be really chill there you have it that is the 2017 2017 the 2017 Ford Mustang GT this is your first time watching thank you for stopping by we appreciate it stay tuned for the next one where maybe we'll get an actual GT
