I love knowing that I'm teaching the neural net when I'm driving on autopilot welcome back everybody to Ted's the driver I hope you're doing very well and I've just gotta say I'm really sorry I haven't uploaded for the past two weeks being in lockdown and trying to run a car channel is pretty tough to be totally honest so if you have any specific video ideas you want to see in the next week or two let me know in the comments section that I can still do while we're in lockdown and hopefully in a couple of weeks I'll be able to go out and drive and do more the autopilot videos again that's the main thing I wanted with this channel was to basically focus on the autonomy of cars and the electric tech of cars and not being able to drive them is really hard to make videos on but today I'm going over a big topic that lots of you guys have asked me about it's my Model X and as a lot of people know I'm actually selling my Model X we plan to sell the Tesla Model X of March this year just as the lockdown hit and it just completely ruined all of our plans my insurance ended in April the tax ended in April three years of my payment plan ended in April I'm gonna go over it all today explain it all explain why I'm selling it there's like a good top five reasons of why I'm selling the car and also what's next let's go over the specs then of the car shall we so it is a Model X 75d all-wheel drive solid black paint 20 inch slip steering wheels leather black seats which was a two and a half grand option back in the day black headliner five seat interior supercharger enabled and super free super charging for life a huge one that is enhanced autopilot which was a 4600 pound option when I bought it smart air suspension and that's it but since then I've also bought the full self Drive update for another couple of thousand so it's got all of the full self Drive features but it is still using a p2 so it's not got the full hardware three built into it as of yet however that will be retrofitted for free for the new owners as time comes because the full self Drive will continue with it which is absolutely awesome we also of course quite it customized at ya know my's like the best place you can go to get them customized black window tints black D chroming which was really nice black coating of the alloys and then we also coated up the reflectors so they weren't so reflecting and they also all the lights have like a smoke pack on them which looks absolutely and it gives the car such a stealth look but to be honest right now I'm not the normal driver of the Model X my partner Holly drives it way more than me and she's pretty upset that it's going let's quickly get her thoughts on the car what the best bits are and also what the worst bits are my favorite things about the Model X are it's very big it's got loads of room for a Venice bike it's got room for Farrow and shopping and all of that so that's the most important thing number two is it was wrapped all black so it looked super stealthy and slick number three its quick on all Tesla's but yeah it's a very quick car it's quicker than anything I've ever driven for for the Falcon doors oh my god they're amazing and number five is I love the big screen oh and finally I love knowing that I'm teaching the neural-net when I'm driving on autopilot first let me go through a little bit of history with our tears the model thanks oh I went down Holly and I went and we kind of played around with it for a bit and then after kind of falling in love with the car slap bang there we put a deposit down we got our order ready car came to eighty eight thousand two hundred and eighty pounds i par texted in my Bentley GTC which I think they gave me forty something for I gave that car in and then the rest of the money was financed and that finance was for two years I'm still repaying and I've got about thirty thousand left to repay on the car I think and then obviously anything else is just already paid for from the Bentley and then from the payments up to now the reason we were swapping it out for the Bentley as well was we had actually just had amazing news Holly was pregnant we were planning for a baby we've been trying for a baby and it happened way quicker than we expected but this mean that the Bentley wasn't good as a family car so at the current time I was I had the Bentley and I had a BMW i8 now you actually could get kids in the back of the BMW i8 and the Bentley technically but they were both so crammed and also the insurance for my Bentley was about four thousand pounds a year and I just couldn't justify it and it was one of the best decisions I think we've ever made it Holly absolutely loves the Model X my partner she absolutely loves it I absolutely love it and our daughter Ravenna thinks it's an absolute spaceship and I'm really sad to get rid of it but there is some really good reasons that I am getting rid of it insurance for the Tesla Model X hasn't been that expensive it's been one thousand eight hundred a year and then it's been going down slowly I picked up the car when I was 20 so that's why the Prix was really high and I've just renewed my insurance literally the other day with Churchill and it's about 1,400 so it has come down quite a lot but I didn't want to have to pay this next lump of insurance because we actually thought we would have sold the car by now also the tax is due today or the other day actually so we're repaying the tax but luckily the tax is absolutely zero that doesn't mean you can ignore the tax letters though you still have to tax your car otherwise you'll still get in trouble even though it costs nothing yeah that's obviously a bonus of owning the Model X we were really drawn to the Model X also by the free unlimited super charging so that stays with the car for life so like the next owner whoever has my car next will still have free super-challenging for life and that saved me so much money I've done trips to Europe trips to Scotland loads of driving around the UK we nearly getting up to 50,000 miles now on the Model X and I've not paid a penny for my energy I paid for it here at home and I have spent a couple of thousands I think probably over the last few years on energy but that's because we have had three electric cars I've tried to plan previously all my trips using the superchargers and it's worked so well and that has saved us an absolute fortune but with the price of the car it's probably not like you know it kind of it swings and roundabouts swings and roundabouts another thing we loved was obviously the doors coming up that definitely sold it for us so I've had a bad back from I think since I was about 14 I was playing football on the street I fell and hit my back on a curb and I was kind of worried about putting my daughter's car seat into a normal lower down car having the doors come up and being able to access that seat access the whole of the second row was just a game changer and with starting up a new family we wanted it as easy as possible as safe as possible because of course it is the safest car out there especially for rear occupancies like kids and stuff it's so so safe and that definitely swung it for us plus the car looks amazing it's fast it's just a beautiful thing so after fifty thousand miles the car has just performed amazingly it's lost about I would say about 8% of its range capacity in three years which considering 50,000 miles as well that's not too bad I've supercharged more than probably the normal person would so I think that's maybe where some of the range has gone but overall the range of the car has kept just over 200 miles it started at about 220 miles so yeah it's probably lost 10% the only downside to the cart I can see that I haven't actually got changed or fixed is the screen the screen has that very slight yellow mark along the sides now which I believe is some kind of adhesive that slightly come off I believe it's covered under warranty so you could be it you could get it changed I think I'm not a hundred percent sure but yeah it's got those slight yellow lines down the side of the screens but again it's not a big issue but it's just another thing that I've noticed over three years that's happened to the car the seats have held up really well the paint's held up really well the alloys have held up really well every part of the car has held up so so well but after like a really good clean a really good polish that thing looks as good as new like seriously it looks like the photos I took of it when I bought it and we sent it down to Yanam eyes and got customized also I've got to say I'm just really into the whole minimalistic look that they're going for so I was expecting some kind of internal refresh of the Model S and the Model X to almost match what the model three in the model yr doing but it doesn't look like they're gonna be doing that so for me personally I prefer the single screen of the model three now and it's another reason that I just don't jump into my Model X when I get in it it feels different it feels more luxurious it feels bigger obviously the air suspension is amazing the sound is is great and everything but because I've maxed out my model three everything seems just a little bit better on my model three three years down the line though we are now ready for something new so obviously I've got my model three which I absolutely love and that's the performance one so it's way way faster than my Model X so now the Model X still feels fast but it doesn't feel as fast it feels more luxurious than the model three but I pick my model three every single time over the Model X now which I didn't expect and I don't think I would be selling it if I still didn't think that but honestly if I had to pick it's the model three every single day which really is just an absolute kudos to Tesla like the model three is a banging car now we have thought about swapping the Model X for the model Y but then the model Y in my opinion is just too close for the model three and I've already bought model three and there's no way I'm losing the depreciation on that to get a model Y and also you can't even order a model Y in the UK like still you can't even put a deposit down we're not gonna be getting the model y however I do of course have the cyber truck on order so I think when the cyber truck comes that will probably become my main vehicle and we'll probably keep the model three I actually plan on keeping the model three forever pretty much it's funny because I don't want to sell the model eggs I think if I could afford to keep all of my cars and more I would do but I'm definitely going to do some kind of transition period in my head where I'm realizing you don't need all of these things so that's kind of an overview of why we're getting rid of the Model X and what's coming next let me know what you think about our situation in the comments section did any of the figure surprise you did any of the reason surprise you and what would you do would you be looking for an upgrade to a cyber truck would you go for a model y or what you have just kept the model X with the free supercharging don't forget because we've had nearly a hundred referrals through this channel of selling Tesla's we've actually got unlimited supercharging pretty much for life anyway because we've got like about three hundred thousand miles now in our free supercharger mileage referral program thing so it doesn't really matter for us because if we go to the model three for example I have kind of free on them it's super charging with that if that makes sense so that was again one of the big reasons I bought it but as we kind of moved across I was like oh actually I don't technically need it again I appreciate it I'm not out driving and there's no new shots of the cars and stuff but there's not much more I can do here I hope you guys are staying inside staying safe enjoying your lockdown experience it's a bit of a weird one I've got to say but when I get out of this as soon as we can I'll be going around doing the city tours every weekend and doing some even more crazy and awesome videos I think the Magic Roundabout in Swindon is next if you don't know what it is thank you all for watching happy Veterans Day and don't forget if you're going to drive drive safe
