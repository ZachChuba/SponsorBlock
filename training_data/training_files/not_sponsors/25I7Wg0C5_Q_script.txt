Thank You Nvidia for sponsoring this video hello I bet you weren't expecting this you weren't expecting to hear that this video is brought to you by Nvidia and then see me on my Treasure Island on the home craft server were you or maybe Ben maybe Ben was anyway this is not actually the Hermann craft server I have spent all morning trying to get the Herman craft 100 parts of the harbour craft world converted over to bedrock minecraft look at this I am playing on the hermit craft world in Minecraft bedrock now the reason I've done this is because I'm hoping to today be able to turn our TX on in the home craft one I've really want to see but I want to see the shopping district but I really really want to see my Omega tree of doom in RTX so a couple of weeks ago Microsoft and Nvidia released minecraft r-tx beta and a couple of days ago and video let me know that there is a new r-tx map pack available in the marketplace created by the community members for me to check out and the first time I played our takes I was absolutely shocked with how gorgeous minecraft was looking get gorgeous so the plan is I want to try and get r-tx working for the home craft server but we are also going to check out the maps that have been released I believe I believe there's minigames and survival games marketplace the dark village all right we are in this seems to be some sort of adventure so let's turn our TX on nice - I'll go for the chest or the lectern first what is this oh it's the skeletal babe I don't like to read I like to lead so chest pick axe axe and sword it's been such a long time since I've played since I played a map but this seems to be this this is glow Mac I guess we'll have to read good traveler I bring you a warning ahead lie a village bereft of life once a thriving place of Industry today it lies in ruins vile spiders poison fine beasts now claim as their own at night the house of the Damned can be heard while scouting the town I found an abandoned mine and then coordinates and earthly sounds come from the deep and I fear this may be the source of the Taos demise demise well I want that before prepare yourself before entering I have failed perchance you will triumph oh and there are moms in here I don't know if this is hardcore I'm gonna die immediately I just kill the chickens and yeah ok alright alright there's another skeleton there but I stay away from the forest oh my goodness ravines in art the eggs in a pretty cool they look they look very dangerous oh I think I found it hello anyone home I'd really like to craft myself a ball I don't know if I'm supposed to break their house but I desperately need a bowl so far it's pretty peaceful in the dark village chests nothing in it either are more chests I need I need food or cold or something yes is one of those houses where I just have to cook my own stuff that is looking really cool oh I think I'm getting close okay over here is this it yes yes I found it I'm guessing we need to go all the way down here oh my look at this oh no is that is there gonna be parkour or do I have to do it seriously you don't have to parkour I just can I just be there just be 200 IQ play yeah I'll take it that's definitely died right yep this looks like a prison oh you surprised me dude this is this is gonna be impossible without proper armor look at this place unless I can fully outplay them here slap here yes yes get rekt oh there's more I got arrows this time though yes oh I'm just having a look around I died well I'm not gonna lie that was mega embarrassed time to try out one of the other ones the observer well this is looking mega fancy look at the floor it's a shiny shiny I guess I guess dark oak floor I have no idea what to do oh there's a chest right let's have a look cake okay lots and lots of cake okay and and a manual all there's eight pages to read read through this manual carefully as it will guide you through daily upkeep instructions it seems like I'm supposed to restore power or something like that in this area I'm just gonna go this way oh no it's this amazing I hate mazes I think the trick would amaze though is to always keep to one sides always keep to the right oh no I'm completely disoriented oh how did I make it right hello have I made it oh no is this a fake this is a fake exit this room is looking mega cool though I love what I love these I guess they are I guess they're iron blocks in the book it says test your intellect with a mind-bending mace I suppose that's why I don't like maces because I'm kind of dumb oh I found my way out again oh okay I'm going this way and on this way instead very fancy this is weird I've walked all the stairs up and the only thing here is a big window and a meeting room that's legit nothing else here I mean did this this is a fancy meeting room I'll give it that guess this is where the boss sits I guess we have to go this way next and oh this looks like this looks to be part or that's that's amazing okay don't fall now oh yes made it made it okay did I do it staircase and more pork or no okay I've never got this far and I think my next jump is from this fence to there but it feels kind of long yes yes yes oh no no that took me so long to get all the way up there I am without a doubt one of the worst parkour there is but I made it back and this time do I not jump here come on yes yes stupid lamp I'm not entirely sure where I'm supposed to go now you need to go all the way down to that thing why was there why was there villager laughing at me was that a trick hello or am I supposed to just jump up to that thing there yes yeah take that villager are you kidding me yes yes yes so did it okay this may be the trickiest jump so far I have to run out of the slab and jump here to land there yes yes take that I am so close to the light now homestretch okay and then I have to jump on top of that yes yes I can't believe it okay don't mess up don't mess up how do i how do I do this I just jump like that yes you can smear out or something this is okay this is really really cool and very disoriented don't tell me there's another maze Oh a chest I just we win Journal 10 pages look there's their parkour area was simple enough yeah let's just say was now go get to the platform leave this wall behind once you've done there is no coming back go find a new seed make it the world your own don't stay behind a glass meant to protect you get out there and explore for yourself we did it the map is complete feed the beast has made a map the egg hunt this is a very very old Minecraft map I think from like 2012 or something like that where you gotta basically collect eggs eggs are hidden across the map click them to collect them so I just walk up and click them yes okay oh that started the timer timer motor is to find them all I didn't read through okay we could we can reset with a snowball so we just got a quick game go back to swarm and we just got a search for eggs I think these eggs can literally be anywhere on this map and there's 100 in total look at this cave I'll check this out the light stays inside if the trap door is closed that is really cool ooh oh no I thought that was speed potions water bottles I'm just thinking water bottles give me eggs take your sword oh I can oh I see one I see one okay so they are really really hard to see yes well at least at least we will finish with at least one egg that's getting embarrassing but they are they are very very hard to see ah there's another one there's another one do I have to pour core up there oh there's a lever that's better okay did that do anything I feel like this is a troll I don't think I can get up there I see another egg yes this place is looking absolutely mega check out that bolt it gotta be there gotta be a negative the bolt oh oh hello pesky birds what do you do hello this guy's just all by himself over there what is this though gallium poshness yep I've completely turned green oh no this is a mazes in it they said this is another maze there's a light there interesting I want to get out of here please egg I did it I can't believe that did I actually beat it could I actually be the base I think I did it said that a secret has been revealed nearby and oh oh wait a minute is this is that what I can't yeah I think this may be the secret hole of reflections hoo there's an egg Oh Mike it's okay this is this is cool although this is a maze yet today so close oh I'm an idiot I think that this is actually showing me this is show me the path okay and to go there and then all the way there and then down okay so I was actually on the right path this is easy no problems hello egg yes the Garbi an egg in this bold song where I'm just gonna just gonna go for it do it I did it yes oh wait a minute I think there's an egg down there but that's an iron door so I have to find some sort of lever or something to open that up wait a minute what is this yes yes I mean I mean where's the egg hello nice now this is really cool oh there's an egg right there it's just randomly easy nice I see another one I think oh yeah there's definitely an egg up there okay see if we can do this just having a whole path I really like how the broom stands look in this they look like look like a scallion potion vials okay this this this is looking really cool this is oh wow I was not expecting that effect yeah this is this is something isn't it I'm not rig nice there's something definitely definitely something elevator yes egg I worked hard for that one ooh lick turn Captain's Log 13 pages oh wait a minute this opens something up a secret is revealed nearby it said okay so that opens up this flip levers to get different paths click the button to move minecart okay so we get in wait what is this trash hopper by mushroom I guess off we go and we're back I shall not fail what if I do all of them upwards yes yes yes all of them upwards that's the trick nice we did it oh I see another egg oh wow this room is this room is cool is this jump even doable I feel like it's not I didn't even jump jump oh but you could just walk up the stairs to get here okay yes this has gone well wait a minute hello yes I've just realized I wonder if this compass is pointing at the closest egg maybe although the compass must be above me there it's pointing this way I think that's what the compass does but I can't seem to see dang there there's a light up there though I wonder how I'll get up there I want to try and use these stumbles oh it ended the game oh the game I thought it just took me back to the beginning of it oh well I had it on timer mode I had 100 eggs I managed to find 26 I'd say it's not the greatest result I thought I'd do better but some of those eggs were very very sneaky hidden I think I think the error I did was that I had got hung up on on a couple of eggs way too long and spent way too much time look at this take place though this is looking oh this is looking really really cool even though I may have failed a little bit with the egg hunt I gotta say that was really fun and it made me realize that with r-tx own mapmakers could be making some new technology things like you can hide things in shadows and they could be revealed only during certain times of the day which is which is which is really really cool anyway now I want to try and turn RTX on in the home craft world and I want to check out my tree look at that it is truly Omega but I cannot wait till I have the whole thing finished right hopefully this works RTX on yes yes I think it's done it I think it has done it okay let's go this way this is our TX in the action craft world there is my chair and hopefully hopefully we don't get any issues with the monstrosity so far so good I almost have to check out my starter base now it's in it's in pretty bad condition though it's the problem came old survival look at this this feels so weird but the floor mix definitely doesn't work when the stone looks like this but yeah this is this is it now obviously there are several different texture packs that you can get hello hello there are several different texture packs that you can get while playing in RTX this I think is standard except for except for the stone texture which which looks like a high definition one or when this is bedrock so villagers work completely different don't they yeah they haven't saved their trades okay any food anywhere I got some diamond diamond shoes ah cookies right let's head over to the tree it's so cool how everything changes with the Sun so now it's like afternoon and everything is like makeup bright because the Sun is so low it's right in my face as well I think it may be a little bit too overexcited to see this honestly Oh take a look at that take a look at that that is looking so good look at this look at the honey hello pigs oh those honey blocks are looking really fantastic they really look like SAP as well hello skeleton just spawning in randomly sunny I think I think I'm gonna go sleep through the night because my base is not safe what's oh oh my oh what is this oh it's my beacon that's right there cool iron block textures here and let's sleep through the night though honey blocks are looking amazing looking so delicious well my storage system is just that just Steve but that's because we use a data pack on the hurdal Kratzer why is there a pill in my base are you kidding me I don't have it I don't have any weapons I don't have any tools difficulty peaceful yeah take that right well I want to have a look at the canopy look at the wood look at the light coming through oh this is just so cool to be able to see oh my goodness oh my goodness I can't wait to see this completely done with r-tx on because everything everything sort of shifts and changes where is my tea by the way oh there it is a very very important part of the jungle but as I was saying everything sort of shifts and everything changes depending on what the time is and I think that is to me that is the coolest feature of this that's at the time to evening again yeah so now it has a completely different light and shadows cast over it and that is that is mega hermit challenges initiation yay the monstrosity at night still looks really ugly still it's mega ugly right I want to fly back to the shopping district and have a look over there as well and here we are look at this this is a very very surreal this is a very very surreal feeling all stress monsters glass shop looks absolutely fantastic with that reflective glass look at that good all the glass cubes I've just had to play around with a few different texture packs that you can change up in Minecraft r-tx and this one this one looks this one looks just a little bit different but not the glass the glass looks like candy in this one I want to see if this has the diamonds glowing the diamond throw it may actually do yeah that looks like they are looks like they're glowing oh look at the poor don't reflect me in the antler sight are they glow they are glowing or they are glowing this is yes they are reflective now knowing that I'd probably be the worst mayor possible for hermit craft just because just I don't know what what I would change I would just walk around and say this portal looks tall this granite is granite I I don't really have to really have much to say but I know I know that I'm not a good mayor candidate so this is my chance this is my chance to sit in the diamond throne only for only for a minute now I don't want to leave I just love this reflective things that certain texture packs I mean look at that look at the underside being all on glowing that is super cool all greens Bart is looking really nice as I said changing the time makes everything looks completely different so let's put it to nighttime look at this gallium show yes yes it is glowing it is looking absolutely delicious and it still sounds just as perfect now granted if I did build this in RTX with this texture pack I'd probably have added some more light sources and I would definitely not have used whatever block this is I swear it's not the right white concrete oh that's a shame actually I got to try add some more glowstone in here and see what kind of effect we can get so this is this is the glass oh that yes a hundred percent okay that's kind of what I am missioned what I built this that is looking really sweet probably sneak in a few glowstone blocks here as well just so that that light kind of leaks down I'm also very impressed with the nether portal look how they reflect all the way to over here I think I like this texture pack more than the other one actually a place I've called down at my Treasure Island and now this is truly looking in its history look at the Treasure Island knowledge is the greatest of treasures oh I haven't even haven't even seen up on the Hermit replace that all redstone glows as well this texture pack also has the very very cool-looking dark red honey Exuma shop is looking looking absolutely awesome I almost forgot this score make a plan top yes and if this looks scary on the home craft server look at it now I don't even want to enter it want to go under the canopy just flying around here seeing all the different colored lights is absolutely awesome it adds so much to the game to have like green purple white light blue magenta yeah it it changes I've read lots of people read that's that's the Morning Sun right one last thing I have to do just because I changed the texture pack is have one more look at my Omega tree now before we take one last look at the tree I thought I'd take the opportunity to say that I'm not gonna be checking out any other hermit space because I'd want them to have the opportunity to do that themselves and I hope I hope you understand that but I I kind of like this text okay the water looks different the water looks quite different but I think I like this texture pack better this made it even more even more Omega and this is early morning they set it to early evening again so that the shadows come from this side yes oh I can't wait to see this in our text with the entire canopy when you get these shadows or lights cast through the leaves that is gonna be really really cool I think I think portals maybe my favorite thing in in this texture pack they are very very very glowing and I gotta say my diamond pile is not that impressive is it it's kind of silly it's very very silly I I have to get back on the home cry server I have to make I have to make diamonds this is
