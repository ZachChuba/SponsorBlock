[Music] with an updated epa rating the tesla model s is now the first electric vehicle ever made to get an epa rating of over 400 miles of range on a full charge tesla has been leading the ev industry and range ever since the model s came out back in 2012 with a range of 265 miles on the model s even today competitors are just starting to catch up to that 265 mile range eight years later along with this news straight from tesla also comes rumors of a 100 kilowatt hour model 3 battery which could lead the model 3 to be well over 400 miles itself so how did tesla get the model s over 400 miles is a model 3 over 400 miles also on the way let's find out if you enjoyed this video please hit like and get subscribed so how did tesla get the model s over 400 miles on a full charge well they didn't update the battery a lot of that actually has to do with efficiencies in other areas having to do with weight aerodynamics thinner tires things like that now when you do the calculation this is assuming the model s is getting 248 watt hours per mile which is pretty low for such a big car even in my model 3 i am really not seeing that low i see closer to 270 to 280 watt hours per mile but this is what the epa test determined yesterday the model s range was just below 400 miles and there was a funny story that elon musk shared that the epa had actually left the model s turned on overnight before they did the test so they couldn't get the full range and that's why the model s didn't have that 400 miles of range he said they were waiting to repeat the test the test has now been repeated and now we have over 400 miles now the other funny thing about the epa test getting messed up on the model s is the epa actually came out and denied that that happened uh but now the test was done and the car has over 400 miles of range i don't think you know in the last few weeks or month tesla has updated enough things to add these miles of range to the car so that's kind of weird i wonder why they denied that or what really happened there what the true story is but the more exciting news to me is rumors of a bigger battery coming out for the model three and what kind of range could we expect for a hundred kilowatt hour pack in the model 3 which is the same size pack the current long range model s uses using the stats of the current model 3 getting 322 miles on a full charge the math works out to getting an efficiency of about 232 watt hours per mile now if you can get that same efficiency with a 100 kilowatt hour pack which that pack will be heavier so the efficiency would go down a bit but let's assume tesla makes some other improvements to help keep the efficiency the same that would give you a range on the model 3 of over 430 miles now as exciting as that sounds it seems hard to believe that tesla would have their cheaper model 3 come in at a higher rate than their more expensive model s but what's coming soon for the model s is the new plaid powertrain tri-motor and most likely with that a bigger battery so again right now the model s has 100 kilowatt hour battery there are rumors that this new plaid powertrain model s is going to have a 125 kilowatt hour battery now if that's true if we can get the same efficiency out of that car again tri-motor car will probably be a bit heavier but let's just assume efficiencies are the same if we can keep those efficiencies the same we'll be getting a full range on the model s 125 kilowatt hour pack of over 500 miles now this makes a little more sense you have the model 3 with over 400 miles of range this would give the model y also over 400 miles of range then if you have that plaid 125 kilowatt hour battery in the model s and model x these are close to or above 500 miles of range keeping them in their premium spot worth a little bit more money and bringing the model 3 and the model y up now this leaves the competition in the dust now this also rolls into battery day which has been delayed because of covid and who knows what else but i am so excited to hear about battery day this is most likely going to bring that 1 million mile battery to all tesla vehicles giving you a better battery hopefully a more efficient battery i haven't seen anything about that unfortunately it may cost a little bit more but if this new battery can use the vehicle to grid functionality that was rumored i have a video about that here then we could recoup some of that additional cost now what else supports some of this uh hypothesis here well what other vehicle is tesla making soon that's coming out soon that has over 500 miles of range actually there's two cyber truck coming out in 2021 is advertised with 500 miles of range on the tri-motor pack you could assume that's the plaid version of the cyber truck and then the roadster is advertised with over 620 miles of range when it's finally released and that was rumored to be a 200 kilowatt hour battery and that may end up being true depending on how much power they can push out of that million mile battery at a time they may not need exactly 200 kilowatt hours but when you have all that power to get 0 to 60 of 1.9 seconds or less you need a big huge battery so you can push a lot of power out all at once so it looks like everything is really coming together here battery day is gonna give us some insane stuff it's sounding more and more like we're gonna get updates to the model y the model 3 the model s and model x with the plant powertrain we'll definitely be hearing about the million mile battery hopefully some vehicle to grid that is something i am really excited for what are your thoughts do you need a 400 or 500 mile ev i definitely am looking at that cyber truck that tri motor it's a bit expensive but uh 500 miles sounds really good especially in the winter we get that range loss here in michigan when it's cold out and to have a 500 mile buffer that would maybe be 300 miles on a really cold day that would be awesome i would love it and i definitely would use the utility of a pickup as well hope you enjoyed this one i look forward to talking you down in the comments and hearing your thoughts about this your excitement having some conversation if you think there's anything i missed or got a little wrong let me know i will talk to you down in the comments and you will see me in the next video so autopilot and i are happily driving along [Music] you
