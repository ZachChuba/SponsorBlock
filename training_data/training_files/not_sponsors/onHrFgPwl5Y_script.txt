[Laughter] hello everybody Jim here with another edition oh the ship this ship the show where we cram things into things until you can't fit no more things that's what we do here that being said today we're cramming all of the things that can fly into the hangar and the vehicle Bay on the carrick and there is a lot of stuff that fits so this is gonna be a long video so if you prefer to skip the shenanigans you can go to the timestamp below and just see a list of everything I learned oh my gosh I think it's gonna fit is it yes it is oh who woulda guessed it's almost like almost like it was designed to go in here alright maybe we should try something a little more risque yeah so I think you can fit it in sideways but you'd have to leave the pilot in this ship you can't get out the back you'd have to leave them in there for a while we'll just toss some food in the cargo space this is where I live I suppose we should make sure maybe you can open the door how will we know unless you try all right moment of truth look at that Oh nope oh my gosh hey now we're fine we're fine I can get out this is beautiful no problems here this is perfect yeah I mean it's oh yeah I don't think I can close it what did you do maybe I can fix it from the inside man that's tight now you gonna get it in no I've got it I'm just shocked at how tight it is I really think I deserve credit for not making a joke here hello I'm Jim from the future or I'm not past Jim who is currently flying this Ann Valero I'm actually I'm not from your future or am I you don't know maybe I'm that good but if you look you'll see that that Pisces in there I took the guns off I parked it in I still couldn't get it to sit when I open the back door it still popped the nose up even with the guns off so I don't think you're gonna be able to get the Pisces in there sideways unless you're willing to leave the pilots in them then you can fit to Pisces or a Pisces and whatever else you want I mean obviously not this arrow you can see I'm failing miserably getting that in there but anything that fits like another Pisces or or any of the other ships that fit in this hangar sideways alright back to the game I think it's going to fit oh so close did you fit I think I'm gonna but I have to finagle it a bit from the outside it looks really close no I got this I know what to do I just have to do it then it's really hard to see oh my goodness are you ever close whoa hold on hold on you've got like you've got like a meter oh it's close enough sit down there you go now you're all the way in that was actually pretty easy eyes I mean I know that I know how to do it I think I could do it again no problem now this is the thing hold on Olin you got to do something first well come out okay then you got well here you can stay in there actually let me put your ramp back up Oh all right come on put your ramp up I would love to but it does not seem to want to cooperate and then let me close the door here well I was gonna do that alright let's say oh I can't get through over here that's all I can get around back it fits beautifully and you can get in the door or not that or but you can go up the ladder so that counts and the doors are closed I love it all that's left is to get this thing back out of here and it should be easy-peasy here we go come on baby slowly slowly alright get that angle on come on come on you can do it you can do it oh there we go a little Oh beautiful oh there's clearly it was just like it was made for this a little bit more little bit more years yeah yeah I'm out so easy so easy why would you even bother using a top hanger when you can park this down there I don't know no that is not a big ship it is not as very low to the ground oh those landing gear cute dude it's like it was made to go in here well as far forage again is that as far far as I can I can't tell oh let me go up front I'll tell you Dan closed why because you can park like two of them in here like a chart chart parking it sideways oh my gosh yes it's not gonna fit but it is closer than I was expecting are you sure are you entirely sure this is not gonna fit not anymore you got room behind you just a hair let me make sure I'm oh yeah you've got like ten inches behind you dude it fits it totally bent fit it fits with some clearance oh my gosh ed you can get two razors in here and a dragonfly I could Park a dragonfly in this space I could totally park a dragonfly over here I think you could get three dragonflies because you can definitely fit one over there which we're gonna try in the persistent universe then you could fit probably one in between the two and then probably one over here [Music] here we go attempt number one to get the razor into the vehicle beyond the character at ention to the flaming wreckage on the floor of the vehicle bay or to how much it may or may not look like a part of a razor that wasn't me that was there when I got here oh wow this is holy crap I could almost fit it in sideways all this is so easy yep we put and razor in here baby who eats ground vehicles I need to store more spaceships good have to cancel that order for extra dragonflies so I can have a race team right about there looks about right Oh what am I done I'm not used to flying fast ships sounded like an explosion yeah I did realize I might be short of wing now well this isn't going to be perfect but I think it's pretty safe to say oh yeah if you didn't blow up your wing you'd be fine um that's as close as they're gonna get I know go to your left why a hair hitting the wing oh crap I'm not I'm not touching oh I was moving and I hit the mouse sorry yeah they fit just fine you can definitely fit 2m 50's in here so I screwed up and blew my wing off but for my next trick I'm going to fix it with the magic of photo editing drum roll please see fits perfectly she fit oh my gosh are we gonna clip on the guns let's see how she fits I think you're gonna be surprised I thought the only problem would be getting through these what do you call them the piston II things you know and it just barely fit with the guns on there is easily room for two yeah you can fit to it and apply for I can tell you you're not gonna be scrambling the fighters out of this one that was real tight I don't know let's see no baby done I wish I will just fit look at me I could get an exterior view you you did that very nicely okay here we go I'm gonna aim just dead center oh you can't do that everybody was gonna say put your landing gear on an aim just dead center and hopefully the guns yeah emergency landing back in here all right I'm coming in hot exit the vehicle okay if I can get out of here I'm coming in hot clear the vehicle Bay yeah totally doable it's totally doable all right come on in oh my gosh it's so tiny so I can power down yeah power down oh my gosh ed oh my gosh I'm so excited now let's scrape the top off with the door it's gonna be like a millimeter Oh open the door open I mean it is you've probably got six inches um more like a foot is it really here close it again yeah like looks like a whole foot sweet do we fit yes yes the end Valero does fit but how well does it fit like if you don't use the landing gear you can definitely land an arrow in here like it fits without landing gear just barely and it looks like yeah the doors does the doors will close in everything what happens if I put the landing gear down now oh the wings ruin it don't know no no no dad you are so bad at flying so bad that was on purpose and I needed another 20 seconds you don't we know what's gonna happen you put the landing gear down you can close it fine and if you'd given me another 20 seconds I would know that for sure you do know it I don't I don't I didn't do it I mean I'll respawn Viney baby thanks for responding idiot who blows everything up all the time it has to be some fun for me too I think this is entirely viable I spin up so I can see that the buck stops here good enough how much did the pirate pay for his piercings a Buccaneer well it looks too wide it is too wide us that is a lot - how the hell did he do that Anglet did you see this but I don't see how it's gonna work did you see somebody get a Buccaneer in ya angled like this you can do it no you can do it I can I mean I can I don't know if you can oh by golly like that is gonna work wow that looks super super stable and comfortable although the credit where it's due this is your best landing ever it almost looked like it wasn't a chore at this point a 10-minute argument ensues where and I am clearly right and Edie acts like a child by closing the doors on me repeatedly when I try to prove him wrong and then seriously considering shooting me with the top turret but then not doing it when I say you're going to shoot me with the top turret yeah it's one of those arguments but anyway I tried to edit it in something funny and it just it just wasn't it was too long but the end result is you can Park The Buccaneer on all of its landing gear and none of the wings engines or nose touch the walls however that Top Gun is just too close and the doors even though they don't touch the engines mess with the physics so that the whole thing becomes unstable even though nothing is touching so to combat that just Park it on its belly like I'm doing right here and everything will work out fine it's even easy after you practice a few times like I'm gonna show you here I think this is my third or fourth attempt and look I just just flew up there with the right angle on my camera and just Park it right in there with no damage to either ship it's actually pretty darn easy to park this thing on its belly you just have to go slow and be gentle like so many things in life and yeah it parks just fine in fact while in transit on that very trip I came across the world's least effective pirate in a Cutlass and scrambled the fighters just to see if I could do it we're running a quadruple time here and normally I would play something like yakety sax but i sadly don't have the rights to that music and I already used my theme song to do speedy speedy video wants this video but even still I think this illustrates pretty well that it's possible but why would you as a single player with another person already ready to go this would be much faster especially if they were sitting in the ship but yeah mostly I just did it for fun and it was it was fun so yeah it worked perfectly would I recommend scrambling The Buccaneer parked on its belly from the hangar atop of the carrick yes absolutely do that it's a ton of fun as you could see it worked it absolutely worked and it wasn't even that hard to park back in the carrot but what if you wanted something a little more utilitarian you might try the Argo now I know what you're thinking why would you try the Argo when the pices is already better in every way maybe because you can fit three I don't know let's find out this first one seems to be parking pretty well oh yeah plenty of room and I think yeah oh you could climb out the side so I can easily get out oh oh I don't know I think maybe we could fit three in here oh holy crap there's tons of room yeah I think maybe we can fit three Argo number two sitting in Super oh wow it's gonna be close super cozy but can we get three this is a hole man this is gonna be tight some eyes let's stop that am i yeah I'm about as close I I can get maybe another doop doop doop careful careful yep that's as close as we get let's see if we can get number three in here lucky number three it is so close it's gonna be tight but oh my gosh oh that's close no no no no no no no stop stop you're fine you're fine everything's fine we're all fine here how are you okay oh no no I don't think this is going to work oh that sucks we're so close to like another foot I think and we could have made it oh well yep nothing to do now but turn it off and hope for the best that yeah die I don't think this is gonna fit but we have to give it the old college try so let's see oh my goodness yeah this is a little too tight Oh what about that door there can I get the door all right no no no this is gonna kill me I gotta get out of here let me back in there we're gonna take off and try and jam it into the vehicle Bay and see if that works this is also not looking promising in fact it looks stupid oh no no no no a little too thick a little too much junk in the trunk I could maybe maybe no I can't even angle it because we've got those big stupid grasshopper legs on top no no I don't think this is gonna work yeah I'm calling this one a bust you cannot yet 3r goes into the Carrack and if you can't get 3r goes into the carrick then you may as well just have one Pisces we do that from the beginning didn't we I know we don't want to use the Argos ooh oh that clipped a bit but it seems stable I know we don't want to use the R goes in the place of the Pisces but what if you're just transporting them because they don't have jump drives like you might want to transport your racer so you want to transport your archimedes or maybe you just want to carry your razor to a race this you might want to you might want to use your character carry the Argo out to the frontier where you're going to use it regularly but not as a support ship for your Carrick yeah you can transfer them they fit everything everything seems to be pretty good doesn't seem to be clipping on any yeah there's plenty of space I'm a little worried that the doors clipped that that giant grasshopper leg but even now it seems like yeah it seems like it fits I think that was just a little hiccup I think everything's fine so yeah I think you can carry to our girzon here no problem if you want to carry it out to your asteroid base or whatever and finally the will it fit obligatory too big for the hangar ship the Sabre Raven oh my good god that is a big ship [Laughter] we're gonna blow this ship huff whoa whoa oh well maybe maybe if I maybe if I squeeze it inside why's there see now it now it fits and then I'll think no no no stop stop stop and then I'll I'll it down like this and I'll just slide it in and it will fit it'll fit perfect see where's my there we go engine off I'm still floating I get out there we go alright Sabre Raven check if it's fine no not a problem what we're looking at now is that list I promised earlier of all the ships that fit don't fit and might fit so for those of you who just want to know this is the list you're after there are a few caveats the Buccaneer should fit it absolutely should fit it's so close but for some reason the gun just barely escapes the top and destabilizes the whole ship the Aurora LX might fit but I forgot that it had a missile rack on top so it might not somebody's gonna need to test that but again you can take the missile rack off the top or maybe just leave the landing gear up and I'm sure that'll fit the anvil arrow will not fit because the wings fold up but you can park it on its belly and it fits just fine and you can fly it out of there actually The Buccaneer you can park that on its belly too and that's fine you can fly that out of there the next list we're looking at is all the ships that will almost certainly fit but I can't prove it because they're still in concept and their sizes could change so yeah these are gonna fit this list is a list of only two ships that I'm not sure about the Aurora Ellen because I forgot it had a scoop and I just assumed it would fit because the other Aurora's dead this is the bit of mystery that I'm leaving you this is a one thing I'm not settling and the other ship is the hull a which could conceivably fit but it's so close there's no way for me to know until I actually get a hold of it and try to put it in there and this final list should at last cover every single ship in star citizen this is the list of ships that do not fit if it's on this list it don't fit if you're one of those people wondering why I didn't try to cram your favorite giant ship into the carrick and there's one in every will it fit video comments section it's because I already knew it didn't fit and I have limited time so I can't actually try to fit every ship into every other ship as much as I would love to do so which means we've reached the end of the willit fit series on the anvil Kerik I did not expect to make two videos on this nor did I expect one of them to be three weeks late but the carrick has so much room and there are so many ships in the game now and I've been away for so long I just could not help but indulge myself and that turned into let's just say an embarrassing amount of time spent on this like I have a number in my head whatever you think it might be it's higher than that I can almost guarantee it if you make a serious kiss so go ahead put numbers in the comments put them in the comments I want to see what you guys think and I can't tell you the number because if my wife finds out she might murder me like to death I did most of this while she was sleeping and well I should have been sleeping and oopsie I'm very tired but it was so much fun I couldn't stop and I actually even wore my brother out he couldn't do it anymore so I had to go off and do stuff without him but I want to thank you all sincerely for watching this video I you cannot possibly have had as much fun watching it as I had making it thank you all for commenting especially and I will see you next time [Music]
