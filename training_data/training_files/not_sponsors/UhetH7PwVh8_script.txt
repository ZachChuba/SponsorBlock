[Music] is the result of a finnish arsonist asking himself how can i create the most painful experience possibly and to no one's surprise this is actually the best thing to come out of finland since somas it's a roguelike where your only permanent upgrade is how much you know about the game and you gain that through experimenting you know asking yourself questions like what would happen if i make my wand shoot a giant sawblade every frame what if i break that giant crystal what if i drink a potion of lava and they all have the same answer you die and when you die you start over but that's okay because the game has that whole random generation meme going on and you know every run is special and unique so sometimes you enter the second stage as a demigod and sometimes the first stage makes you want to kill yourself the main selling point of the game is that every pixel is simulated which is great until you realize that every pixel on the screen can and will end your life that orange pixel you stepped on that was actually lava and you're now burning to that you attacked an enemy it's now bleeding toxic sludge all over the place you included also some enemies beat acid which is basically just a more potent version of lava good luck obviously though for every obstacle in this game there's a solution and figuring those out is what this game is all about but before we get into that this game has an insane amount of secrets and content and a lot of that is going to be spoiled in this video now normally this is where i would tell you to play the game first and watch the video after but the thing about the puzzles in this game is that the developers genuinely do not want you to find them i've already made a video on this on my second channel so i'm not going to get too deep into it here just know that the puzzles are just so extremely well hidden and just convoluted in general that solving them on your own is practically impossible it's like if someone took 10 puzzle boards with a thousand pieces each scattered them across the floor and injected you with a lethal dose of fentanyl so with that in mind you might as well just watch the video good morning people when the game starts you wake up outside a cave and that's it you have a jet pack a couple of ones and a random portion there's also some rocks that teach you how to control your character and this is the first of many instances where you learn that firing your wand isn't always the best idea then we enter the first stage the mines the mayans is a fairly standard starting level and much like you it's extremely flammable now in most games being near wood and the lantern isn't really a big deal but in neutra it's a death sentence so how do we avoid burning to death water if you're wet you don't catch fire alternatively you can quickly submerge yourself in liquid even in a pool of oil just make sure that the oil is actually oil and not whiskey the game never outright tells you about these mechanics but it kind of nudges you in the right direction by burning you to a crisp 10 saves in a row anyways video games as you make your way through the mines you'll encounter the local finnish wildlife you got some zombie dogs some purple things some zombies with shotguns also known as and much more most of them die in one or two hits but there's also standard who has a [ __ ] ton of help for this stage in the game and bleeds lava if you shoot them which is extremely lethal and will kill you in seconds so just in case you haven't figured it out already i'm going to give you a moment to just guess what the game is trying to teach you here spread throughout the level there's going to be random ones for you to pick up they all have unique stats but for those to make sense you need to know how once work let's use this starting wand as an example when you shoot it it's going to fire a spark port wait 0.18 seconds and then fire one more now it's used every spell on the wand and will recharge for 0.37 seconds and that's it not too bad and then in this next example it's going to show now at this point in the game you've probably done more or less what there is to do in the first stage so you have a couple of options you could go into the portal at the bottom of the stage and move on to the next or you could you know just explore because remember there is no timer in this game you have all the time in the world to explore to your heart's content so instead of going down why not try going right to the right you'll encounter a lava lake now this lava lake is big it's just big enough so that you can't just jet pack across but with the help of your two remaining brain cells and a cup of water crossing this lake becomes a walk in the park so you cross the lake and then you cross a wooden bridge and then you make it to an orb room which naturally has an orb in it the orbs are essentially noitas health upgrades so you know the game is rewarding you for your curiosity which is great but you're forgetting that you're not playing a video game you're playing nuetta i mean did you really think you could just walk into an orb room take an orb of true knowledge and just what walk away you see the moment you leave this room you'll encounter the first boss of the game and his name is aka squidward has a lot of quirks about him that makes him really dangerous whenever he's attacked he gets a reflecting shield that lasts for around one second so if you got a fast firing one that disintegrates other enemies that won't be enough here he summons wands that generally kill you in one shot and some of those ones copy your spells he barely takes any damage from explosions and he's immune to freezing acid on the lava polymorphing and just about anything else you could possibly think to chase him with also he periodically shoots forming projectiles in every direction that either silences every spell you have for about 13 seconds polyworks you into a sheep making any attack instantly kill you starts teleporting you around completely randomly possibly into a lake of lava blinds you for about 12 seconds which wouldn't be the end of the world if it wasn't for the fact that 12 seconds is longer than it takes him to shoot another pair of projectiles meaning they can even overlap so you could be blinded and silenced you can be polymorph and teleporting or you can be dead and dead so with that in mind how how are you even supposed to beat this boss well it's actually really simple you might have picked up on this already but a lot of the spells in this game almost seem designed to kill you so what happens if you make him copy one of those and then you know you get your reward for killing the boss which are two really powerful spells that just straight up kill you and considering the solution to this boss the reward is just [ __ ] poetic i i you can't just not appreciate that in the beginning of the video i mentioned that there were going to be massive spoilers but at some point i realized that if i were to cover everything there is in this game this would literally be one of those 5 hour joseph anderson type memes so i decided to only cover the early parts of the game so that you can get the gist of it but you'll still go in more or less completely blind should you decide to play it anyways i hope you enjoyed the video and i just want to give a huge thanks to nordvpn and my patreon supporters for bankrolling this video and to wrap it all up here's some twitch clips of me being terrible at this game enjoy [ __ ] this stage man it's it was it's it's wider it's wider than i thought i thought it was gonna be more narrow anyways three health i'm scared i don't want to lose this run not like this why didn't they trigger it no more oh he's in the mother [ __ ] it was the man now of course it was the mana god damn it where's that [ __ ] oh there goes my run okay uh anyways [Music] okay anyways
