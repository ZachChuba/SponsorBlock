hey guys jen 2000 here i'm going to do a real quick tutorial today in response to uh this email i'll bring it up in a second uh yeah youtube's right to monetize right here youtube has monetized all content on the platform yep even my content so which i can't make money off so they're making money with content i can't make money off so what i'm going to do in response to that right what i'm going to do in response to that is i'm going to show you how to get ads removed from youtube on your desktop um it's probably a similar process if you want to do it on android uh i think youtube advanced is what you want to look for for um an android device but for um desktop um just you you block origin um so basically you get this screen add to chrome add extension done and then um here i will pin it and yeah and then it should be automatically enabled on all your sites and then you go on to youtube i'll just show you that works i mean i've done it a million times let's do gordon ramsay shocked by disgusting cafeteria food voila one hour of gordon ramsay hating on food voila there's also no ads in the middle of the video as well if you're worried about that um and then also as a bonus i'll go to a linus tech tips video because there are they are infamous for putting segways in the middle of their videos and i'll also tell you to download something else called sponsor block and sponsor block what it allows you to do is exactly what you it blocks all the sponsors so it also um so i'll just do the same thing again i'll remove it from chrome and then you'll have this screen and you can add it to chrome add your extension and it works straight away there is actually a bit more setup here so you can there are actually a couple of settings here of what you actually want to skip so you can skip sponsorships then you can also skip intro introductions and cards and credits interaction reminders so you can skip all the subscriber notifications so when youtubers say can you please subscribe to my channel can you like the video please or that you skip all that automatically unpaid self-promotion so based that it's a similar thing so it's auto skit and then non-music um it's for music videos if you um want to skip all the non-music of a music video it's really good so i'll just bring up so yeah and thousand dollar gaming rigs there's nothing unusual you'll notice for roblox i mean i i don't really care about the content too much but 69k likes looks pretty good and then roblox amongst other things here just automatically skips the intro of his video so you don't have to watch it and then if you've got these you've got um i don't even know what that is it's not labeled but this is actually really light on the sponsorships i'm not gonna lie to you um so i'll try to find another one that has more [ __ ] yeah oh yeah angry joe show is also pretty big on my god resident evil then um you saw i should have went through that bit so basically what happened is you you every single time something skips you can rate how well it skipped so you could like it or dislike it so it's um it's a pretty complicated system where what they do is if um is if uh they take everyone who's submitted something and whoever's is liked more is more likely to be shown to others and then if you get more more dislikes and likes um you your submission goes into the darkness basically so it just shows the best ones um it's more likely to show the better ones and that's what it um and then you can also see your sponsor here get a 30 off whatever that is it'll just skip it for you it just does it automatically and yeah it's just it's it's so it's so good because it just allows you to watch stuff seamlessly i'll just show you uh it skipping the yeah it just skipped right into 35 seconds in so it skips to the start of the actual track so that's what it does there and then also skips the end of it um so like if you've got this in a playlist you can um it will skip to the next song so you can um you can listen to more music without turning back to it and have to actually manually do it so that should just make your youtube viewing experience just a tad bit better so yeah i'm just giving this to you guys i'm just showing you exactly how to do it because youtube thinks they can make money off my content and i want to make sure i make nothing now because i can't make money i'm going to do a destructive interference that makes sure they will not make any money off my content because or they'll actually have a net loss because people who watch this video may never have heard of me and it will be great because then youtube won't make money off them because i don't have any ads to stop and it's a great way of protesting because you can still watch all the content you like but you don't actually you don't you cut out all the money that they make and then if you want to support the creators that make said content you can bypass youtube entirely support their patreon buy their merch and you can support them directly they get a bigger cut anyways so if you do that i i mean that's what i'll do if i was going to support a creator now i just go to patreon or um you go to their patreon or buy some of their merch like gamers nexus makes a good merch so if you um won't really want to support a creator that's how i do it now just cut out the middle man but still watch their content on their platform if you're still watching thanks for tuning in see you guys next time
