today's video is sponsored by potaka having not used an iPhone in like years I decided it was time I've been using the iPhone 11 pro for about two weeks now in place of the pixel three as my personal phone when I say personal I mean for evenings weekends basically when I'm not at work the things I look for in a good smartphone are price battery life and camera when it comes to pricing the iPhone 11 pro cost me about sixteen hundred Canadian dollars compare that to the pixel 3 which I paid around $900 for I'm gonna see this right now although this is a better phone it's definitely not worth $700 more than this let's talk about battery life one of the things that no matter who you talk to you is near the top in terms of features they value I wasn't really expecting much out of the 11pro due to its smaller size honestly I didn't even realize how good it was at first last Saturday night after a long day out I went to plug him on iPhone and notice it was sitting at 55% my pixel 3 would have been long dead and the note M + easily below 30% it was definitely one of those wow moments and battery life is important to you safe to say Apple killed it and this is on the smaller 11 Pro I can only imagine how good it is on the Macs a great way to not worry about Maggie's and magma clicking the link below cameras are always a tough topic since it boils down to preference I'm not a photographer by any means if it looks good then I'm usually happy Apple put a lot of emphasis on the cameras in this year's iPhone and they deserve credit for the improvements they've made after using it extensively for the past two weeks these are my takeaways I found myself still preferring selfies on the pixel 3 most of the time especially when you take into account the second wide-angle lens the iPhone takes beautiful selfies though and I did like certain shots on it over the pixel 3 on the back it's 3 lenses versus one the extra telephoto and ultra wide lens on the iPhone make it a much more versatile camera set up an ultra wide lens is quickly becoming an important feature for me being able to fit more of a scene into a single photo does wonders for capturing the atmosphere and reliving memories down the road it's actually crazy how different some of the photos come out between the cameras just look at this photo of these sitting inside a coffee shop this is a drastic example but the vibe is so different between them generally though the iPhone takes brighter pictures that lean towards a yellow or warmer temperature it really boils down to preference with these high-end smartphones nowadays because they all do so well and good lighting night mode on the iPhone is very impressive I actually preferred that it automatically kicks in for those of us who just want to pull the phone out and snap a picture I was seriously amazed by some of the low-light photos I was taking it's probably my favorite camera for a low-light right now kind of disappointed it doesn't work on selfies or the wide angle lens though when it comes to shooting video I've been super impressed with how good the 11pro does something about the footage just looks so good stabilization is also outstanding and makes using a gimbal almost unnecessary the bottom line if you shoot a lot of videos this won't disappoint video on the iPhone is top notch speaking of top notch although the design is a little dated at this point I have to admit face ID is great and I think I preferred over a fingerprint scanner now in the past I was so adamant about having a fingerprint scanner but after experiencing face ID I hope other phone manufacturers implement something as good I got so used to it that I started using face unlock on the note M plus instead of the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner even if your phone is lying on the table you can just lean over look at it to gain access my last iPhone was one with a home button so this is actually my first time experiencing the iPhone gestures and you know what I like them they're fluid and this reach ability gesture is super handy swiping from the left to go back works and most apps I kind of wish it was on the right side to use since it was quite a stretch the new Android 10 gestures which I've been using on the pixel 3 are very similar it may switch it from one phone to the other super easy you can't help but think that this was intentional by Google to win over some iPhone users I mainly use apps that work across multiple platforms nowadays since I like having access to no matter what device I'm using things like Google key for notes a bit working for passwords google photos and drive for cloud storage you get the idea combine that with the iPad pro being the only other Apple products I still use regularly I'm not really tied into apples ecosystem this is intentional and I know I'm not getting the full iOS experience it's just I don't really want to get tied into a single ecosystem that if another company comes up with an amazing product I can't even consider it because it won't play well together I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with Apple's ecosystem if anything it's the best of the best things work seamlessly together and for most people it's a great fit including friends and family mind I personally just like options when it comes to my tech even if you're not a fan of iOS it's great to see Apple bringing some serious upgrades to the camera and battery arguably two of the most important features that consumers look for I'm sure every other smartphone company has noticed and that's a good thing for all of us the experience going back to iOS was surprisingly easy and I felt right at home after a day or so no you don't get all the customization options like on Android and things feel a little more locked down but most will likely be fine with the 6 by 4 grid of apps with the iPhone pro costing as much as it does what really irks me is the 64 gigabytes of starting storage they definitely can do better than that my general conclusion is that although I like the phone I'm personally finding him very hard to justify the price tag I mean if you're if you plan on using it for the next 3-4 years then sure it'll make the price easier to swallow especially since Apple is great with keeping their phones updated if your phone's battery already lasts a full day and you don't really care much about photography then I'd say save your money it's been said before but the regular iPhone 11 is probably the better for most people who are in the market for a new iPhone that's the direction I'm leaning towards you
