as the performance improvements and each new generation of smartphones have dwindled engineering and marketing departments alike have looked for new ways to quantify just how great their latest gadgets really are now before we had the races for more megapixels thinner chassis and ever greater pixel density displays with all of these eventually reaching the point where they actually caused as many problems as they solved and lately it's been all about screen to body ratio and boy has this one ever resulted in some ugly ducklings thankfully it's almost over and I'ma tell you why with glass where Android device use offer code Linus to get 25% off glassware at the link below [Music] so the current goal for pretty much every modern smartphone manufacturer seems to be to build a phone with bezels so thin that they're effectively not even there I'm sure some of you are already drooling at the thought of an all screen phone but others might say well it's kind of stupid aren't bezels small enough as it is and those people have a point for some of the folks out there bezels have already gotten so small but they can make it more difficult to use the phone like if you're reaching across with your thumb while typing one-handed the thing is that you need a little bit of bezel in order to hold on to your device and there's got to be a little bit of non sensitive part there because skin is not hard it's soft and it kind of pushes onto it now this is something that's less likely to come up in portrait mode but I've actually noticed that it can be uncomfortable to hold a phone with tiny or no bezels while watching videos or playing games your mileage may vary though but in spite of these practical concerns there is certainly some sex appeal if nothing else to an all screen device so let's take a look in today's video at the various approaches that manufacturers are taking to get as close as possible now the first thing that probably came to your mind is everybody's favorite the knotch it seems like everyone loves to crucify Apple for inventing this and you wouldn't be unfair to say that they definitely helped to popularize the design but Apple wasn't the first company to utilize not that particular crown of thorns lies upon the head of LG their v10 launched back in 2015 had a massive notch in the corner for the front cameras now they kind of put some spackle on this with a second display that was used exclusively for shortcuts stats or notifications so people really didn't see it as taking away from the main display hence the lack of outrage the first screen to actually make use of an in screen knotch was the sharp s2 as a way to showcase their freeform display technology freeform works by moving the displays driving electronics away from the edges and into the screen itself allowing a display to be made into virtually any shape a couple days later there was the slightly more popular essential phone and then finally of course the iPhone 10 so why does the knotch need to be there well if you extend the display all the way to the bottom of the phone removing the chin bar all you need to relocate is the home button which can be easily moved around to the back or the side or done through software without any real compromise to usability however when you go to extend the display upward to remove the forehead you encounter a bit of a dilemma the front facing camera and sensors can't really be moved without sacrificing some pretty serious functionality hence the knotch the next attempts to make an all screen display were kind of a throwback to the sliding phones of the early 2000s now there is some variety in the approaches around this concept but they mostly fall into two types either some portion of the back of the phone slides up exposing the selfie camera and/or the sensors like on the Xiaomi me mix 3 or the camera pops out on a little nubbin like on the vivo necks now at first glance this kind of seems like a no-brainer the perfect solution that just took a little bit of backwards thinking but sadly there are a number of downsides to either design with the biggest one being structural integrity going from that no moving pieces to well any moving pieces will have some impact on the phone's durability especially if your slider is motorized like on the Oppo find X and you're gonna be kind of screwed if the internal motors just stopped working especially on this one because they also got rid of the fingerprint sensor like Apple and that's before we can even get to the other downsides like how would you make a case for this device and if you could well how is that slider going to affect its susceptibility to water damage or dust ingress now technically there is still time to see how these devices hold up but in my book honestly they're just kind of a dead meme at this point I mean they're cool but which brings us next to a solution that be obvious to anyone who thinks that people posing for selfies are a bunch of narcissistic douche bugs douche box I like that douche box what if we just removed the selfie cam then who cares the problem with that is that well then you wouldn't be able to take selfies anymore but fear not VEVO solution to this is what actually inspired us to make this video the V phone X dual display is a truly fascinating device as the name implies it actually has two displays one right here on the front and another one on the back so the idea is that when you want to take a selfie you can just flip around the phone and use the rear display to see what the crap it is that you're doing now it is a little bit less convenient but I gotta say using your full fat rear camera to take your selfies is going to seriously help you step up your Instagram game and what's cool is that the second screen also provides some extra functionality like showing you the framing of the shot if you ask someone else to take a photo for you so you can avoid that whole like hey can you take a picture for me and then they take the picture and you like look at it and you kind of wait till they leave and then you ask someone else because they're just completely incompetent it also allows you to quickly flip to the other side of the phone to attend to random social media stuff while gaming and some other things as well it's kind of cool but the current implementation is still a little bit clunky not to mention that on this particular phone there's this massive weird camera bump that doubles as a notification LED rings I don't know I think a regular LED on the back probably would have sufficed so hopefully the next version goes with that instead with all that said out of everything that's available right now the dual screen approach to making an all screen device is my personal favorite even if there's still some work to do on the software side of things I've already seen a rear screen used in other novel ways like on the Nubia X which handled switching screens really quickly while I was playing with it at CES and use that rear screen to provide extra rear buttons for gaming the issue though is that every one of these solutions seems to make at least one compromise whether that's a less intuitive experience making the phone a nice or compromising durability or adding thickness and or reducing battery life because the bloody thing has two screens so back to that ultimate goal of a whole screen phone the only perfect answer seems to be an under screen camera but at this time it looks like we're gonna have to wait awhile for that now we did visit lg displays Factory in Korea quite recently and they were extremely proud of their approximately 50% transparency OLED displays but given that issues exist with selfie camera image quality already cutting the light transmission in half probably isn't gonna be a good time but progress is happening so under screen fingerprint scanners like the one in the oneplus 60 and in the vivo next dual screen here actually are very similar technologically to camera sensors just with quality standards that aren't as high as you'd expect from you're trying to snap a selfie in the club or whatever so I'm still pretty hopeful but let us know in the comments down below first would you have preferred that we had gone with our original plan of just doing a normal review of this phone or did you enjoy us using it as a prop to take a broader look at current all screen display and second what do you think is the best solution currently on the market in the how did you hear about us section so thanks
