hey guys welcome back to my channel so if I understand correctly this is her second pre-release music video which means that this is still not her comeback music video which is insane because in my opinion I think I've said it the last time already but like she kind of like kiss on raising the bar every time she comes back and even though this is just a pre-release so technically it's not as important as a comeback music video you know but still like the quality is here the bluff is here she's serving every damn time in my opinion I've seen some people being disappointed with stay tonight I like that song grew so fast on me it became one of my favorite songs so this time around it feels like she's going definitely down the where is it this most summer-ish Latin sound route which is coming back to her roots a little bit when she debuted with why don't she know I was like oh my god this song is too yeah it gave me major like throwback alright so unfortunately there are no English captions but play let's just go ahead she's gonna be so my god serving [Music] she's gonna oh my gosh she's Scotch like her makeup every damn time the makeup artists just deserve the right her dancers mm-hmm like it goddess you know come on blow your mind yes this is the femur like who is it like push it for sure Oh oh my god [Music] she the way she just looks into the camera though this shots are gorgeous [Music] honestly though looks like she's been serving lately superior one of the best in the industry hands down this when she's kind of like doing the Toro rah oh my God look [Music] I'm loving every time she has like one of those tents break with one of her dances I wonder what type of dance it is though you know cousins definitely like tango were like where is it different type of things [Music] Oh [Music] she's serving every damn thing [Music] visuals dense vocals the high note [Music] stunning honestly [Music] oh they're like elements of flamenco in this Wow this shot oh my god stunning Oh Indies Oh the song we can all agree is assumable it's very fresh is very dynamic you know and it's one of those more powerful more intense I would say and I'd really do you think that one of the reason why I'm thinking it's harder it's because of the maybe more Latin like inspiration from the song but not only in this song can we find those inspiration I believe like the outfits the reference to do the tour railroad type of thing I'm not sure if I'm using the right word but it's like a Spanish tradition isn't it so here she's displaying that with a car which is thank God it's a car enough nothing else right it's explosive it's fresh is really just impactful what I love with ties that she is displaying so many like so many times and even when she's not singing like actively singing because this is tongue was part she is still capturing the camera so perfectly well she's so uptight izing if that makes it likes her presence her aura she's so I catchy you know she knows how to captivate you even though she's not the one singing if that makes sense to go back to the more Latin maybe inspiration I wonder if the dance that that she has like the ways it to do it is that how you call it I don't know is like the couple dance that she had with her dancer I wonder what type of dance it was and honestly I'm not surprised anymore whenever she is having this dance break or whatever and she is showcasing yet another style like last time she was more focusing on the voguing part here she is showing yet another style of dancing was so freakin impressive because that just shows how she's so versatile and she's displaying yet again another style of her she keeps on improving she keeps on growing she keeps on bringing so much to the table and I think this is one other thing that I said also the last time she's bringing so much to this industry and I'm so grateful to have her as a solo artist and representing this female solo scene right now because she's serving she's killing it now the song at the moment might not be my favorite but then again I think that's what is said also during my erection to stay tonight and it ended up being one of my favorites so I will have to play it to play it to play we had to play it again just to have a clear idea of where exactly I would put it in my list but I think because of how versatile she is you're able to enjoy all of her music during different moments of your day or your week or whatever you know this is just great timing honestly this is summary this is great this is colorful this is explosive this is hot this is just very much her and I love it and now that this is her last previous music video I just cannot wait for the actual music video come back because again as I said in the beginning she's like raising the bar you know so you I mean I have very very high expectations now I don't know what to expect but I kind of already I'm expecting her to kill it so anyways that subscribe to my channel and I will see you then they see a tire bye bye
