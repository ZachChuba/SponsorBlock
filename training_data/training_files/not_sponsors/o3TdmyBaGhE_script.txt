going to be different than any of the videos I have done on this channel it's really long it's gonna be in two parts so make sure you listen to the whole thing before forming your own opinion this project was a huge challenge for me it was a lot of work a lot of editing a lot of just new things that I haven't done yet but I found it to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I really hope you guys find it to be as meaningful as I did while working on it I actually first heard about this case over this summer I was just scrolling on Twitter one day and I saw someone had retweeted something from Ray Andrey Akio and he was talking about how her son's case file and autopsy photos were released to the public without her consent and this just made me really angry and I couldn't believe that that had actually happened so I messaged her and you know just said I'm so sorry that has happened to you and that's not right basically was something really short and she got back to me and said thank you and then after a couple days I heard from her again and she asked me if I would be interested in covering this case on my channel and once I started looking into all the details behind the Christian Andrey Akio case I was blown away so Josh and I decided we were going to go down there and here is what we captured while we were there we would like to thank recon for get 15% off your purchase today [Music] hi how's it going can I get an idea names please who are you here to see ya and rockiest alright but now this is not necessarily exactly how well this was some furniture he had at the apartment that we that we just put in here and of course his bike wasn't his dirtbike wasn't in here we just put it in here that was his 16th birthday present he wanted that set of car he wanted to Katie you know there's specific like what he wanted was Santa's so that was his the flag on his face that they print sent to us the captain from the his co-workers sent to us and we night attendant framed and the Merchant Marine flag we hadn't put up on the wall up there and this was the hit this is one night Kevin Taylor and them went out and I don't know whether he stole the Sun or whether they found the sign don't worry behind the sign but there was a picture that he'd sent me one night that liked to look like in the morning he and some of the guys were holding up you know the sign and so we took it to the funeral home and his friends signed it and everything really well 8% yeah he really was [Music] [Music] they would get up still at 5:30 and so I'd get up at 6:00 and he'd be already out on the jet ski nobody else I worked out there at that time the morning he'd be out all over the lake yeah like yeah he just like the like the atmosphere you know up here [Music] and I just told myself I don't have any Patriot y'all I wanted all the kids really utilize well that might be a little bit home to all the teachers he said why don't have to wear makeup but then when I saw that picture I don't like you I'll make a skinless room yeah yeah yeah this is my other favorite pic I guess they're all favourite pictures my own but I just thought that was at a for his house her grandfather was talking about he was a real cowboy that people didn't know what real cowboys weren't anymore and so Christian went and put this on we came out was like no I'm a real cowboy and they took a picture of it that's a great thing [Music] you need to treat her like a little clean yeah just a typical rambunctious boy he and Josh to me were like yin and yang you know cuz josh is very reserved and kind of quiet to himself and Christian is well he was very outgoing and talkative and the life of the party and so they kind of equal they kind of balanced each other out and we're josh is very much more analytical christian was very impulsive and let's go do this so let's go you know whatever he and Josh were very close because we did look what he did well we lived out in the country up until we moved here about nine years ago and so they didn't really have anybody else to play with you know playing outside and in the creek and that kind of thing we're very very very close family you know cousins aunts uncles brothers sisters I mean we were all right there cuz we like riding motorcycles yeah it was kind of a dare example do something doing yeah if no cocktail and what thought went on at my house when I was at work the lights always kind of I was it's Christian you know she wanted to always be right up under him and wanted whatever he was doing she wanted to do and so when he was riding his dirt bike Todd had built him up dirt ramp she would see him doing that so she wanted to ride their bikes but she was too little we thought so I found out later that we had like one of the big dog kennels the hell middle whatever so he would walk her in the dog town tire road to the metal bars a title to his dirt bike and he would drag her dragging all right I feel you know I remember one time when we sent him to his bed for a timeout he did but he was real quiet back there she's my favorite check on him so I went back there head open the window $5.00 sitting out there on this one you know in court he loved to wrestle and to like fight dude all the submission Holmes you know and I would be sitting in my chair and he would come in and just lay on top let me go okay it's a death roll yeah you know I can't breathe I can't really get this ball off this and start tossing it there and I'll be like free shipping it up put it up oppression don't touch my bed don't do this you know and he'd be like why I'm touching it I'm touching it yeah yeah I was working at little mark school he was on so I got to know him being honest guys from junior high fly ball to he played I just remember being a good kid you know he was always just had the he had a small of a lot of terms he was so magnetic that he attracted like this following almost and so for me it was just always getting to tell everybody like oh well that's that's my cousin and I think it's special that not just me but other kids were able to recognize that magnetism that he had at such a young age that was the same way that he was like when he was 21 versus when he was 10 he just had that group of people always around I loved him and he protected them there was someone that spoken his funeral his [ __ ] about you know that Christian was always the one that stood up for him in high school so yeah he definitely took that trait with him from elementary on he had a older man that I mean I don't know I think Todd may know him and he asked how Christian had been gone for several months and he saw Todd somewhere and he has tied you know we're a Christian being and he untied said wall he passed away and he said well you know he used to stop by and just check on me like once a month and ask me do I need anything and this was like an old man [ __ ] like a family member it was anybody that we even really knew it somehow Christian have met him somehow and he said you know he hang out and talked to me for 30 minutes or so and asked me did I need anything and then I'd see him in another month or so so I may his things like that that we never even knew he did everybody loved him yeah because you know you he was just lovable yeah I don't chew him out and made him have it and even though I'd give him a hard time he knew I loved I always try to make everybody laugh even at his own expense you know I'm saying he was in the 11th grade that year and this is his girlfriend Avery my name is Derek that's Avery sweet Avery yeah she was a really good student he did anything that asked me to in class it was never like disrespect never anything like that you know even though I knew that he didn't want to do it and I might have to prompt it several times Hey you can't put your head down you know whatever but he and and the main thing is he would be fine if I could get him to talk about dirt bikes yeah or every my daughter brought him home to us and they dated for about five years all through high school so pretty much she was just family he was right there if we were up he was there yeah he went everywhere with us and do you remember any first met him mm-hmm she takes you as a nerd yeah machine there are you know thudding by like Christian with like her because he was kind of you know yeah yeah yeah she brought him home but she brought him home or the pretext that he was going out with her friend because that's how it started she was talking to Christian for a four-handed fulfillment so I was hauling them off to the movies and everything and somehow they were always sitting together and then finally she's like yeah he's my boyfriend now he was always laughing yeah he um I promise you my husband's not here but um had he been anything but upstanding with my daughter he she would not have walked out of the house with him we totally 100% trusted that when he was with her Christian literally would die before anything would happen to her he was a brother I mean you know I would have done over them anything for him and he would have done the same I would buy them round to come roll in when they were too young to drive to learn too young to go and they yeah they might have had a beer to buy day where I mean you know she just can't become kind of part of the family because they did date for a long time so you don't Christmas she came made Christmas and he went to her house at Christmas and just the typical long-term boyfriend/girlfriend relationship you know and he went on vacations with them and she went on vacations with us and I can't just a typical I mean we loved we loved Avery you know we we knew she was very motivated educationally yeah and very studious very much so very much so very very private quiet again very different from Christian right I mean he was just the life of the party and Avery wasn't one to go to parties but again it was kind of a yin and yang I mean he drew her out of her shell song and she did go to parties and she did do things that she had not done before ray had bought a lot on the lake and all and they started building a house so we kind of helped out on that when everyone get off work and enduring work to build our house yeah you know we built all of that stuff out there boathouse and everything out there meet a liquor store and Christian was a hard worker yeah oh man he put his hands on in Spain Jerry you know I mean everyone's scared to do anything really it was hard it's working you know it would work you know it's kind of like Ray's mom or here she just barber work over go he you know it's kind of like that he just you know he did not mind work that though and he was proud he was helping build this house yeah so he would come and they become tell us what all he helped do and I he was learning but yeah hard work and when I say that maybe was a real kind of guy you know I mean and it always had a good time with him it one they were a downtown yeah I always have smiling face you know I'm sure kinda knew that whenever he was 18 that he was it was actually 17 he was talking about getting on the table but I think we had somebody that knew a person that worked on one of the boats already with Magnolia marina but yeah he went out there and he liked it he was out there for like I'd say probably a year or two before I went out there they go up there and load and then come back down in New Orleans and unload and they just got back and forth through the Mississippi I mean it was pretty nice it was it's not as hard as everybody makes it out to be most part it's just getting used to being gone for 30 days and you know the weird work schedule it's like six hours on and six hours off and it does that the whole you know you just alternate two shifts a day the whole thing it ends up in like 31 or 32 days he liked it he liked it the whole time he was doing it he was pretty quick learner too I mean he he's that he was always good at it stuff like that you know like working with his hands and more mechanical things I think he picked up the way a barge works like a chemical barge works faster than most people just the way his work his work ethic helped him move up pretty quickly I need was a mate before he was even you know 21 which was pretty much unheard of because most of the people on the boat you know he's 20 years old and you know he's the boss of everybody on that boat aside from his captain the pilot probably and most of those guys are in their late 20s early 30s I mean he who was definitely proud about what he had done what he accomplished it takes a certain kind of person to work out there because it's even you're spending nine months on a boat out of the year and the other three months or the only munch you get not working when they broke up do you think it was more Avery breaking up with him or you know I was always there that night it was sad who had just been coming be taking a job right you know how school with the UM with the tugboat and Avery was going to college yeah and it was just one of those things you know he was home two weeks and during that period you know he was off work he wanted to have fun and go I mean Avery was in school and she had to keep her grades up and she worked full-time in the vet's office so she could you know fulfill her career and um she couldn't go yeah and it just you know was just one of those things a great part yes Daddy life thank you hey you know I think they were both girls I had but you know I think they thought knew it was coming you know it was just one of those nasty you know I know even even at the point when they decided they weren't going to date anymore he still came over he still takes it home and talked you know when his birthday I would call and I always ended up thinking they would be back together yeah you know like when she came back I just think the distance you know probably took them apart we all thought that was Christian got a little older you know more mature that you know they work out yeah I think he was upset he didn't show it on the outside but I think probably in the inside he was more upset than anything it just was come where our less like we're gonna work it out you know I think he takes churned stuff yeah so he had hope I think so yeah kind of how I looked at it was that you know Christian and Avery had always when I say that they broke up a lot I mean I'm not saying like every week but I mean you know they go four or five six months and then they might break up for three days and then they get right back together typically yeah yeah because you know there were a lot of times that Avery didn't go within places because she did take her studies very seriously so I think it threw him when she said you know kind of enough s'en of of course at that time he was working and only home 15 days and I don't think that was it because in a way that's almost good for her because she was in college by this time and sort of gave her you know 30 days of she could really focus on her studies when he was here that 15 he was wanting to go go go go out friends and go here and go there and she'd be like why I can't go or go out of town and I got class and so again different their their lives at that time were not meshing well but I think that it really threw him that they didn't get back together and she she this time kind of put her foot down and said I think we are at different places and we need to take some time apart it was almost like well I'm only home for 15 days and if I'm not dating somebody then I mean it's like I don't have time to really meet people yeah cuz I'm not here long enough to get a relationship started yeah and so really Whitley looked up in that because it was almost to her advantage that they could get into this relationship very quickly so pretty shortly after Christian and Avery broke up for what seemed like possibly the final time Christian started dating another girl and her name was Whitley she was a lot younger than Christian but she ran in the same social circle as Christian I mean everyone in this small town knew each other Christian in Whitley went to the same school even though they were there at different times because there's an age gap when did you first meet her I didn't meet her until she came over here they have been probably I don't know if he called a date they've been hanging out for several weeks and then she came over here one day you know just like for the Dean you know just through the house or whatever hung out here she seemed fine I think she put on a good front of you know just seemed like this yeah you know I was so mean she was a cute girl I used to sit down there and play video games Whitley all the time but first she was just kind of meeting my aunt and nice she saying like and what did you think of her when I first met Jimi thoughts joopa son sweet you know cute girl and way I'd like to have a good time on the weekends and also I mean we all get to know each other you know yeah her family and and they are like crucian you know you never find him like that did like Krishna people started asking me like his Christian date and whittling and then they start telling me those stories because I had no idea who she was if I remember anything we were like Oh Christian Whitley right here and it being like a little bit more distant I guess I never seen him you know not happy but whenever tourists end of everything yeah you could see that something was kind of it's like you're right exactly for sure we went to concerts together I've always been into music he was big into music and so I would say music and movies I was a big movie go work when he called me up sometimes I could call him and say you know they're just moving out you're gonna say it yeah I go you know Sunday afternoon Christian was just kind of my buddy you know Christian was one of those that didn't mind being seen with his mom you know in future 617 no he was fine with you know just being he only met 17 years old he was fine with going to concerts went so Lincoln Park in Nashville and went saw Eminem and went saw Kid Rock in Birmingham and was finding I'm going to say we're on an Eminem Whitney passed away the soul that kids for them we didn't have tickets I was her last conversation actually I called him on the way to work and said hey Briana and Eminem just announced a concert and you want me to get tickets and he was like you know let me check my work schedule and I'll let you know and you know I'm taking a barge I gotta get off phone gotta go get fuel is you know who love you talk to you like if it was that was our last conversation he knew he was planning this I just feel like bad anyone not just him but just in general if you have this plan that I'm gonna go home and kill myself right I mean there would be a little bit of nostalgia there's a little bit of your mom is 20 that I love you maybe a little bit you know you're you've been a great mother I mean there would be some kind of whatever I mean it was just a normal conversation just very casual to suck I talk to you later call you when I get finished when Christian always usually said love you when you know when you get off the phone it was a very casual so it was just things like that that I was like this whole suicide thing just doesn't play out for me I don't want more emergency well with other sosa suicide this move okay what's your address the woodland apartment was an apartment what apartment number Oh 8 I was are 801 this one yourself IBM Dougie's navigators boys I hit it kristin is rock you rock you yeah okay and your team into he committed suicide there's millions but he's light across the bathroom Tobin he got blood everywhere okay he said either spawn everywhere he's across the bathroom yes my page he's not breathing [Music] okay okay I really need to tell somebody in the family I think you shot himself no I left to go to the store and he uh he went to the bath and I had one of every well I think anywhere to give it to me one up and sitting in here of human her and so I'm sitting in my chair and she comes and just flops down this picture on my little thing there in the bed and I'm like what what is that and she said I'm that's what I think of that picture and I said I mean what is it a picture of because it was holes in it and she said that was a future of Avery and Christian and that's what I think of it I was like I mean I mean I was so shocked really and so then I told Christian about it and I was like you know Christian there's something wrong with someone who comes into my room takes a picture does that and then has the nerve to come and even acknowledge us kimchee room you know it - yeah and of course you know he tried to blow it off though she didn't mean anything by it I'm like no you that's just some drones my dad does that that was like red flags for me everywhere because of yes I mean my psych background just comes into play and I'm like this is just somebody who something's really wrong with some women Dez laughs Whitley was always into something she was always into trouble had an anklet on because they were making her come to school so she had to wear that and you know one time it went off and state testing and they had to get her mother to come and charge the batteries but one huge incident that happened when Whitley was staying there was when she actually gave their youngest daughter Alexa xanax she just gave it to her and she had never had it before and then left her in the basement and her parents found her like all knocked out and obviously that was a huge concern to them and they decided at that point it was time for Whitley to leave the house ran off after that curse you get her out of here what happened I mean because she gave her something she did she'd never had just left her back there and when they kicked Whitley out Christian was really upset he was very angry at his parents there was a ton of tension in the relationship they were really at a terrible spot at this time and right around this time Christian's older brother Josh was going through a divorce and had an empty room in his apartment that he needed a roommate to fill so he asked Christian if he wanted to move in and so he and Whitley tagging along with him ended up going to the apartment she's really young and she was you know just seemed to me like you know any other high school girl who wanted to go out and party um I mean I hadn't lived in the apartment for I guess a year and a half two years I had gotten divorce and I kept the apartment and I asked him if you know he wanted to move in because I needed a roommate and he said yeah sure I didn't keep up much with you know the situation with him and Whitley and their relationship then like I didn't really like to understand knew he was with Whitley but I didn't really know anything about her she wasn't supposed to move in from what I remember he was gonna move in and obviously you know he was gone for so long she was just gonna come over I guess basically when he was home and then she would go back to her grandmother's or wherever she stayed when when he left but it turned into I mean her basically just moving in and then I kind of I guess kept an eye on her when he was gone just to let her know you know like basically letting him know that she wasn't messing up or if she was on drugs or anything basically just babysitting her I didn't really talk to her much I obviously I talked to her more when they moved in it still wasn't very much um I remember when I was that age and I would have thought it was great to have my own place and stuff like that I just figured and I mean I even tell how you even told him this any any girl her age would love to have their own a place that they can call their own where they don't have anybody tell them what to do you know they don't have really any responsibilities and they can do whatever they want you know he was working and I guess she was getting money out of his account from Western Union he had asked me to go and buy a drug test and basically give it to her and tell her to take the drug test I got off work and I went to Walgreens or something about a drug test and came back and I think it was like probably 7 or 8 o'clock she came in I entered the drug test and told her to take it and he had told me you know if she feels the drug that's kick her out she refused to take the drug test so she just I mean she didn't take the drug test at all she just said I'm gonna fill it for you know whatever I think she said like pot or something like that called Christian told him and he said no home teller direct ache the drug test anyways because if she says she's gonna fail anyway so just take it and prove that that's all you're gonna fail for so she ended up finally after probably an hour of you know trying to get her to take the drug that finally took it and failed for I don't I mean no think of it's like benzos and pot and something else I can't really remember I kicked her out and remember she got old her stuff in a trash bag and she ain't like there was like no reaction to it at all like usually if you get kicked out because from what she had told me at this time was like before this was she had nowhere to live like her parents kicked her out couldn't go up there so she was gonna basically be homeless she really did not have any reaction at all put her stuff in a trash bag and she's like okay and walked out that's it never seen him I like that's like she knew that she wasn't gonna actually be kicked out Christian was always like a guy that when he got off the boat you know he was gonna go and hang out with all of his friends he was gonna see everybody he was gonna go and you know have fun he was gonna you know go out to eat with him go to a party go get on the boat I mean like he would be doing something from six o'clock in the morning until whatever time at night when all the decided to go to sleep and they both lived here if they were actually going out and doing things when they moved into the apartment like he didn't ever go out he didn't have people over I mean like that's that was very unusual you know they basically just sat at the apartment and played xbox so let's talk about Christian and Whitley's relationship a little bit I think it's important to kind of understand how it was for them you could definitely say they fell really hard for each other really fast they were both really into the relationship people have described Christian and Whitley as being obsessed with each other but with that being said the relationship was a little bit toxic for a couple reasons one of them being that Whitley didn't have a job in Christian didn't and as no he was working on the boat he was gone for long stretches of time so Whitley wasn't working and she was living off of his money pretty much and living in his house using his car and one could maybe suggest that she was using him and then there were also a lot of trust issues on both sides of the relationship they were both cheating on each other at different points in the relationship they also both kind of had an immature mindset when it came to the relationship thinking that they were going to get married even though they were both cheating on each other and weren't serious about it often fantasizing about their future and how great it's gonna be but not actually showing that with their actions and while Christian was away working on the boat they did communicate constantly as much as they could because it's not the greatest service out there but when he did have service Whitley was texting him all the time sending pictures back and forth selfies they were constantly talking to each other so let's talk about the voice behind the 9-1-1 call that you've heard so this is dylan Swearingen now there's some debate on whether or not christian and dylan were really good friends or whether they're mortis two Quentin says but like i said this is a small town and everyone knows each other and Dylan has been around for a long time and Christians life they went to school together they were in sports when they were younger together so they knew of each other and then it seemed that towards the end of Christians life they were spending a little more time together Dylan had a reputation for partying a lot and a Christian was someone who liked to party he was definitely someone who as his mom even said was the life of the party this whole group kind of partied together hung out together and there is definitely some sketchy stuff going on within the group when it came to drugs so it's really important for this case that you understand the life insurance policy that Christian had many people would wonder why someone so young would have a life insurance policy but his job could be dangerous working on a tugboat can be dangerous and in fact Christian had actually fallen off of the boat a couple months prior to all of this nothing happened to him but would have been bad and so he ended up getting a life insurance policy through his company with most of those type jobs they have a pretty good life insurance policy and so I mean that's just standard they pay for it he wasn't paying for it it's just paid for and I was down as has beneficiary I mean I didn't even know this but I was down as beneficiary and Avery was down as his secondary at some point when we found out that Avery was a second beneficiary on the life insurance policy and she did not like that she wanted Christian to update it to her instead he had said something too tight I think maybe the hitch before his last hitch about you know maybe he should change his life insurance policy to Whitley said he was gonna take it from take Avery off I got some wool wash I kept telling Todd why would a 21 year old even be thinking about life insurance yeah she had told him that she thought she was pregnant and then there was a conversation about well you know what if something happened to you and when I saw that I told Todd I said there was I said she he planted she planted that in his hand of what if something happens to you and then he thought well you know what if something happens to me and then you know there's nobody take care of her and what if she's pregnant we had this person to contact us her friend was involved with this group at that time and she was in rehab and was going through the 12 steps and he got to the part about making amends and she had contacted this lady from rehab to say I know what happened to Christian and rocky oh and I want you to call his family and tell them and she she said that the plan was that Whitley was supposed to get Christian to marry her and actually she was pushing in text messages for him to marry her and he was like hey we don't have to be married yeah to be married to how you know because she was up until my being pregnant well we don't I don't want to have a child if we're not married she was supposed to get him to marry her and then they were going to kill him and then she would get everything she and Christian you know went to the mountains and this is this kind of shocked me a little bit he went to a jewelry store with Avery years back and they'd send will flower things every once a while and we got mind I said I said ma'am I sent him a text I said ma'am what are you doing in the mountains I said we're getting a jewelry thing he better be up there trying to propose and I got text why not I said because you're not it's a nice rate of proposed doesn't do the stuff you're doing because he and some of the guys he was on the boat with go to strip clubs and stuff like that he had a girl in Vicksburg and then I got a text back and said uh like what what girl in Vicksburg I was like whoa wait a minute yeah and she had his phone she was texting me I said what you just called me when you get ready and then the next morning he uh I guess you they had been fighting all night or whatever he called he said man why are you singing texts like that to me I said I could sing that to you I said you takes me first you know after after you takes me back after I asked you a simple question so I felt like at this part in the video I needed to just explain to you guys what was happening in Christians life leading up to this day and then the timeline of the day so Christian boarded his tugboat for his next hitch on February 22nd 2014 Christian's brother Josh his roommate was also on a boat at the time so no one was home at the apartment except for Whitley now at this time Whitley and Christian's relationship was really unstable they were both you know having affairs Christian was really worried about what was going on at home with Whitley while he was gone who she was with who she was partying with if she was possibly cheating on him and he was so paranoid that he actually had a tracker set up on oh he was also worried that she was using drugs back at home and she had agreed to stop so in the days leading up to the day Christian passed away he was texting with his brother Josh about how unstable the relationship was and according to Josh Christian had every intention to kick her out of the apartment and actually break up on her and move out of Meridian that day Dillon called Christians several times and told him that Whitley was actually riding around in his BMW with another guy and because of this Christian decided that he needed to go home see what was going on with his girl and get his car back she was already supposed to be kicked out of the apartment at this point but she actually came back so Christian was gonna have to go home and kick her out himself now obviously working the type of job that Christian works you can't just get off the boat whenever you want you're expected to be there for a certain amount of time so Christian actually had to make up an excuse in order to come home so Christian ended up making up a story to his captain that his dad and his sister Alexa were being kicked out of the house by his mother and that they needed to get access to his apartment but they couldn't get in unless he was home so he had to go home and help them obviously this was completely made up but that was what his excuse was to get off the boat and he also said that he would be back at work the next day at 5:30 so he was planning to come back so at this point it's late in the day on February 25th Christian had to find someone to pick him up because he was getting off the boat in Louisiana and his Jeep was still in Vicksburg Mississippi so he had no vehicle when he got off the boat so he actually called one of the guys that he worked with on the boat who wasn't working at the time named Justin and he asked if he could pick him up but he didn't answer right away so he kept calling and eventually Justin did pick up and he agreed to come pick him up but before Justin even left his house Christian called him back and said never mind I have a ride and he was actually now planning to be picked up by so Dylan ended up picking Kristian up at around 8 a.m. in st. Rose Louisiana then the two of them made the three or so hour drive back to Meridian and they arrived back at Christians apartment around 11:30 a.m. and so this is the next day so February 26 2014 so at this point once they got back to the apartment we truly don't know what happened all we can go off of our statements from Dylan and Whitley so here are their statements Christian called me at 1:37 a.m. asking if I was able to come pick him up at Saint Rosalia Hanna at a docking bay that his barge had stopped I told him yes that I could pick him up he told me that I needed to be there between 7:45 and 8:00 a.m. I left my home at 3:45 a.m. to 4 a.m. on my way to get him we exchanged a few phone calls just to touch base and he would ask me where I was or how far from the landing area after a couple of hours or so I finally reached the destination that he was at I called him when I arrived he said give him a few moments he came down the hill where I was parked and removed his blue jumpsuit he wore for his work he said he had left without permission and the security of the place along with the sheriff were alerted but he decided to leave I have no conclusion on whether he was able to leave or if he just left by self choice after we left the destination I picked him up at we talked like we always have nothing was out of the ordinary we stopped at a gas station got us some drinks and he filled my truck up to get him as we pulled out and got back on the interstate he began to tell me that him and Whitley were having relationship issues the issues were regarding another boy hanging out with Willie while he was gone and he then told me this was the reason for him coming home then we continued our route to Meridian just talking and listening to the radio we pulled into the apartment complex that he was living at he noticed the BMW he bought for Whitley was there he walked in he began asking her where she had been because they have a tracker on each other's phones she spent the night at the boys house that Christian earlier mentioned his name is Matt Miller after asking her multiple questions regarding what she had done she mentioned the usage of xanax she was not sure of some of the activities they had participated he blames annex for her not knowing I stayed upstairs a majority of the time due to I didn't want to interfere with her argument I stuck my head over the stairs one moment and heard him saying over and over do you love me after a few times of asking he pulled his gun out and cocked it and stuck it to his head and asked again do you love me she said yes and tried to grab the gun away from him after a while things calmed down and we watched a movie I asked him if he wanted me to go get some food and give him a moment alone he gave me his debit card and said get some chick-fil-a and to take all his money out of his account I asked him was he sure and he replied yes he also broke her phone in an earlier argument I told him I would take the phone and see if they could fix it I got the food and he provided me with the banking information but they said he was the account holder and have to withdraw the money I came back and everything was fine we watched another movie I noticed they were leaving I said where are y'all going you replied to take a little ride I fell asleep and woke up around two hours later Whitley was asleep and Kristian was sitting on the couch smoking a cigarette he acted normal and I said I'm about to go to Best Buy and look at speakers do you need anything while I'm out he replied no at an earlier time after I saw him point the gun to his head I took the gun from him and placed it behind the curtains because he was acting very aggressive as I left I told him I hit it due to his actions and I gave it back and told him unload it and please don't touch it as I left I made it to Best Buy and talked to the car audio technician as I walked in I noticed he wasn't on the couch and I walked around the apartment calling him and got no answer I walked up the stairs notice the bathroom light was on so I figured he was taking a shower I knocked and said are you alright still no answer so I walked downstairs and walked into a room that Whitley was sleeping in I told her he didn't answer me and that we need to check on him she went back to sleep and I walked back up the stairs and knocked once more I asked aloud again Christian are you ok he didn't reply so I opened the door and I saw Christian laying face down across a tub with blood in it I yelled Whitley Christian is dead we have to call 911 and she screamed and ran upstairs and began holding him I then called 911 to the apartment and police arrived and then took control of the scene and just to sit in the living room Saturday the 22nd also the day Christian left for work at 5:00 a.m. that night I went to a Mardi Gras party with my family he stopped talking to me starting at 1:00 the day he left for two days he has always had trust issues and when I eventually got in touch with him he said he would rather me be at home missing him and didn't want me going out from past issues that we had I contemplated breaking up with him and tried to convince myself we would work things out because a relationship without trust isn't a relationship and we tried for so long to build trust and be normal but I loved him last night the 25th he said he was coming home and quitting his job I told him we could talk it out and there are some things we need to work on before we could move on with our relationship today he came home early and wanted to take a ride with me we went to Bonita and he just said he felt like between me and his mom he couldn't make anyone happy then I laid down with my dog in our bedroom Dylan the guy who picked him up from work then woke me up I went upstairs and found the love of my life base down swooshed up in a puddle of blood so the only thing that we can confirm about their statements is that Dylan did go to the bank around 12:30 p.m. and tried to withdraw all of Christians money there's actually a security camera image of him at that time so we know he was there and then at 106 p.m. he actually did go to chick-fil-a there is a confirmation of that from a receipt that was found in the apartment but we cannot confirm that he went to Best Buy in the Meridian Police Department never went to Best Buy to confirm his alibi that he actually went there later on investigators tried to go confirm it themselves but the footage was unavailable at that point so at 4:45 p.m. Dylan called brain and I were out to eat and my dad called and he and his dad I mean you know they talk solve it was kind of unusual for him to just call and go yeah and he kept calling and saying y'all need to come home he told me there'd been a tragedy I was like whoa what do you mean he said you just need to get up here now uh-huh and he said just come and you know I was like we're not worry we won't get up and come home cuz he wouldn't give us a reason he just said y'all need to come home you know and we were sitting there for a minute and what can be the tragedy Christians at work yeah we were thinking there was something maybe happened to Josh you know and he's you know he told me it was a tragedy with one of my kids if I says something has happened to one of the kids and you need to come home and I called him back I told me I need to get out there when my kids was dead we get in the car that's all he says and we go you know of course we just get up and leave and all the way from right into his dad's house we're going through the kids we're like well no it's not Alexa cuz this is a church I said no it's not Christian cuz I just talked to Christian this morning he's on the boat in New Orleans and of course Josh had not been working that long on the tow boat so we really thought something had happened to Josh because you know you can fall off a bus girl you can yeah I mean something can happen after that I don't remember took my I don't remember yeah walking in here and talking one was a detective he tells me that Christian has killed himself and I said well it's not true because I mean young Christians on the boat and I said it's some other guy he gave me Christians wallet so I did everything I want someone to see and make sure that that's Christian and so I call Chris right called and she was just hysterical and I said hope calm down what was wrong and she said the police are here and they say the Christian is dead but he's on the boat I just talked to him this morning he's on the boat no way it can't be him well there's always just become I said I'll let me get let me get see so I drove over to the apartment and when I pulled up they had the apartment taped off yes just the door right there and I got out and I said hey you know what's going on he said Chris I can't tell you anything you mean to get out of police stations man what happened yeah you know my sister called me she said my nephew was dead what was going on and said you're going to get the police station and I get down there and I walk in there and detective Thompson comes out and he says you know he tells me that the Christian committed suicide and you know I didn't really such a shock yeah sure right like that that I I couldn't it didn't really process it I said well you know what you sure it was him and he said yeah his ID and all was on it my dad called me from down the stairs and it was sort of late at that point I remember it being dark outside so maybe like 7 or 8 he said your mom is gone to Ray's house something has happened and I still was just like okay you know what has happened and he said Christian is dead and it was like all the breath was knocked out of me and I remember just I'm falling to the floor and he picked me up and I just I couldn't breathe and he carried me to our labor room and got me some water and I just remember like I didn't know what's the thing you know I didn't know what happened he didn't know what happened it was a lot of confusion it was like nothing ever felt right like from the very beginning it was just something it's off about this and I didn't even learn until the next day that there was a gun involved and we just heard about it we just took it for face value yeah because that's what it was supported right that's what it was and we had not seen rainfall in years you know crime watch daily then he came out on TV and we watched it then we were like something's bad wrong yeah we saw the forensic evidence so you know everything we heard the experts would like something is bad wrong and we can shop with it like really really closely huh because we've been really going it was not yeah Houston County you know made with Lee's aunt and he said man I got some tay said the cretians from China's own he called you from the apartment yeah EMS and police were actually late to the scene Dylan had getting the wrong address and getting the right room 801 but city being Willow reach he told him it was under some apartments on highway 30 men are on highway 19 the apartment my office area what Bill Maher you and I know would just be the car is the silver truck in the silver BMW beside each other what's the department right number 1:39 right this my mother's I said building ain't this move do you see a letter on his door or anything are you saying the officers or anything no room you're starting at the woodland right this man the woodlands abode and I'm sure not a 8:01 deer run at Willow Ridge well total I gotta hear you call for little Ridge well over it this is Willa rhythms okay I understand you're upset well you can't touch anything in there you got to come out here they don't want you to touch anything okay I got officers on the way over there okay yeah that's strange that all these people were there before police it's really bizarre really bizarre and then amt you know that's new evidence you have to tell every one of those people how to get there because they got there before the first responders got there and I'm bad for Gil fool but after I say something one time you know it would click in my head oh no that ain't right I'm sure a lot of stuff was going through his mind when everybody's talking I want one but after the first time that when they call banks are you sure you had the right apartment you're not Italy somebody's head like no and rich partners so you heard about it before the police were even there yeah essentially when when you shouldn't call me I didn't know at the time but yeah they they was there I don't know how long that is there for police I mean 10 or 15 20 minutes or whatever I mean and I thank you soon as even been on record saying that you know dealing and I don't know whether it was out there but Dillons is out there walk around like a normal person you know for them to go out and find somebody laid over at up ed and up there messing with them are different stories and they're going through his pockets and everything what kind of person is that when the officer arrived at the scene Whitley was really upset she was crying downstairs he went into the apartment and went into the bathroom and then found Christian in the bathroom so he went ahead and called it detectives the EMTs and another detective arrived at 5:08 p.m. and then the coroner arrived at 5:25 p.m. so investigators start checking out the scene looking around trying to get a feel for what happened and at this point they actually found ad cocked gun which is very interesting in a suicide to find and they were starting to just you know make initial notes Christian was found slumped over the bathtub with his arms and legs out of the tub but his head and upper body leaning into the bathtub he was kind of in a almost a Z position his legs were against like the porcelain part of the tub and the gun was found wedged between the bathtub and his left thigh which is very confusing because if you shoot yourself you're not going to be able to function enough to put the gun anywhere it would have just fallen down and a Christian was right handed and this was the left side so this is the first of many inconsistencies now this is a very confusing part but at the time of all this there was a police chief named chief Lee living in the same apartment complex as Christian now multiple people that were at the scene at the time say that he was there but there is no confirmation that he actually was there because he did not record it he wasn't on duty at the time he never made any record of him being there but multiple people say that he came into the scene after about 40 minutes of police and detectives being able to look around and just said to shut it down without any explanation before they were done with what they were doing told them that that was it this is a suicide period he just walked in and said shut it down that's insane and that's what I'm not only getting that from raving like the EMTs I've talked and when we were doing our thing and he walked in and said shut it down and they couldn't even finish what they needed to do well that's part of the problem too is everybody wonders law I will tell you that MBI came and interviewed myself and Robert and they advocate you know is there any reason for us to reopen this I told them pretty much what I'm telling you you know that that it didn't feel right it didn't look right and they said okay you know and we'll look into it so to wrap up their investigation police decided to do a gunshot residue test on Whitley and Dillon and Christian as well police also gathered some evidence from the scene they got a projectile as they call it or a bullet in a shell casing from inside of the bathtub at this point Dillon and Whitley were taken to the police station for some questioning I called ray and told ray you know I'm sorry I it's him I said well you need to get his phone and you need to get the keys from Whitley because Whitley is gonna try and take his car I said okay so we get back down to the police station and I walk in there and I said look yeah they know where his cell phone is and the keys to the BMW and I said where are the two people that weren't were the people that within an apartment right time I didn't know what was - yeah - take their tops and stuff well they're in the back you know we're interviewing on more questioning or whatever and I said okay and he said we don't have you know I don't know where they're at and he said but you can get back to the apartment and say I said I'm not going back in there that's a crime it's a crime scene isn't it they said well no you know we're done with it I said David I'm not going in there you know not until so there's no way I can go in there right now we we left went over to the apartment and my buddy said hey Co need to go in a so I don't care if they released it or not you don't need to go in there so I go back down to the police station and I said hey we need that cell phone you know one of them two in there no but this time we knew it was at noon so they know who had the Father or words that he asked her says well do you know where Christians cell phone is and she said no oh she said no I don't know where it's at I said okay she comes back and hands me the keys and he said Chris she doesn't know what cell phones at us to do these kids nowadays they don't go anywhere without that cell friend that's like and I said I'm not leaving until we find the cell phone either she verifies us in the house in the apartment said the car somewhere I'm not leaving so detective Thompson goes back into the room where Whitley's at says ma'am you're not going to be able to leave until we find the cell phone and she reaches down in her purse and hands it to detective Thompson and says oh well here it is you would think that that right there was said whoa wait a minute why would you be lying you got something that simple I went and picked Joshua from the boat because he was on a different boat from Christian and all the way that you know I was you know pushing in Josh I mean not concepts like whoa what did he talk about it has him and her been having problems to be honest we I didn't know he went datin Avery yeah it was pretty new fish yeah you know Josh so like he didn't do this I mean his is that worse me was he was going to kick her out this was the night of us finding Christian I mean I picked Josh up like two or three o'clock in the morning Wow yeah and then after that I mean I'm sure it's just your typical group you know what a parent goes through I mean I just remember coming back or being here I guess I don't know I don't guess I ever left and you know some of my friends came over and I remember going in the closet for some reason and just you know I'm just crying yeah yeah but I really don't have good memory of light the the days behind that next week I remember going and you know I was on this mission that you know and everything had to be perfect for its funeral you know and it had to be the right music it could have be [Music] I remember having to pick out a coffin and all and I think I was just bizarre yeah you know for a long time you just don't really think it's real something you know will happen you think I got Christian yeah now you'll catch yourself thinking I mean this me it's him brilliant and like golf you know he'll come back one day um so what do you think about when they told you that you know but you know when the cops do you something like that you you know you kind of something in back of mind so you got to believe this cuz this you know this is belief I mean I never thought it was suicide so shortly after this the coroner determined that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and they determined that his time of death was 345 but the cause of death was ruled as undetermined they could not figure out if it was a suicide or a homicide but then the following day the medical examiner actually did his autopsy on Christian and determine his death as a suicide so obviously the police ruled this is suicide extremely quickly and they didn't do any type of real investigation there were so many inconsistencies and missed evidence at the actual crime scene it's just insane police asked Whitley if Christian had ever talked about hurting himself and she said I don't think so then they asked her did you shoot Christians and she said no and then they asked Whitley who found a Christian and she said Dillon and then she admitted to being on xanax at the time and sleeping through the gunshots not hearing anything I were you asleep when 45 was shot at seven hundred square foot apartment yeah you didn't hear it they have questioned her about it but yet when Dylan comes in says wake up would you go check on Christian she's white try that so like I mentioned earlier the police tested whitley and done for gunshot residue on their hands and they both tested positively for it however whitley told police that she was gonna test positive before they even tested her she said i'm definitely going to have gunshot residue on my hands because I went out shots and guns with friends last night just out into the woods now this has become known as a gun night and we cannot determine whether or not it actually happened there were three other people with Willie that night their names are Jett Matt and Zack now if you remember Dylan had mentioned to Christian when he called him when he was still in the boat and said that Whitley was driving around with a guy in her BMW now this was Matt who she was at gun night with the night before so police also interviewed the other people there that night and Matt actually said that Whitley did not shoot a gun that night however Jett said that she did so we've never been able to determine what actually happened that night now there were inconsistencies in Whitley statements across the board because she was actually telling friends that when the gun shot went off she actually did hear it and she woke up and quickly ran upstairs and saw him but that's not what she said to police and also when investigators were interviewing people in Whitley's life about the whole situation they all said that Whitley had an issue with lying and she's a compulsive liar and some of those people even right off the bat said that they believe that Whitley had something to do with Christians death and according to people around her she acted completely fine after Christian had passed away which is really odd when this is someone who she claimed was the love of her life so the next two weeks were obviously horrible for the family they went through the funeral and everything and then two weeks after Christian passed away Josh ended up having to be the one to go back into the apartment the crime scene they don't do anything with it hmm that's all the family's responsibility to clean up I think this was incredibly hard on him probably harder than anyone can even understand if you notice Josh is not on video in this series and that's because it's too painful for him to talk about these things on camera it's just so much that he went through honestly cannot imagine having to walk into that scene when I stepped in and didn't look right in the first place not for what I was being told happened for whatever reason I told myself I feel like I need to take pictures of us because they're saying this happened and it's not what it looks like happened even those pictures that I've taken I mean they they call that into question and say that you know well that's not there in our pictures so you must have splashed that blood on wall all they have to do is not do I mean they just have to not do anything and anything you find or anything you bring them they just call into question and you know if they don't want to do anything about it they can just not do anything about it I mean I found stuff there I found the shirt stuff behind the the toilet that was covered in blood and dog hair and dirt and all this other stuff that was clearly used to wipe something up I found the knife I found that with two knives one that you know I thought looked like had blood on it to me and gave it to MBI and turned all the stuff in and there's no mention of it in any reports there's no let me know nothing and they don't have to because he didn't take it as evidence so it's not evidence to them I guess I mean I assume that when we took it up there they probably just took it from us through it later the phone that they gave us was long to get down to the Sheriff's Department asked him can y'all break this can y'all get in there yeah so they break in and they busted open or whatever well they're gonna call them locked it yeah and the guy called me said Chris you probably don't want to read these messages I said well now I mean you know we're gonna have to if some day says there's something there's some stuff on there so this was like four five days maybe after Christians funeral so I read one and I held onto the phone for a while I wouldn't give them the right yeah I don't know if I kept it for about a week or two but you know I just told her I said okay yes you just don't need to see the stuff right now do I think that Christian killed herself no I don't if you read those text messages and that's all you read yeah and you eliminated the fact that everybody including mr. Coleman and Bilbo admit that the body was moved you taking in consideration that the gun was on the wrong side all right deaqon then yes I can see people thought oh well why are y'all worried about this this is nothing but suicide yeah so these text messages are extremely difficult to read it they definitely make you think twice about everything but I think it's extremely important to remember that you cannot prove that someone committed suicide just by text messages that they had written previously if anything you could see that as a way that someone could say oh this person would have done this anyway look at their text messages and it's kind of the perfect person to do this to so I don't think that those text messages prove anything but they definitely make you think twice about the whole situation this is an older phone and back in the earlier versions of the iPhone you could go in and jailbreak it and change messages and stuff at this point in time I didn't know that you could go in and that you could change dates and all on the phones and change the messages and stuff like that now it's really interesting about that is dylan actually knew how to Jailbreak phones he kind of was this tech wiz and he would do it for people including Josh and Christian he kind of was the guy everybody went to to buy an iPhone or get an iPhone fixed or jailbreak an iPhone or anything relating to iPhones and rocky has started requesting the case file pretty much right away I mean they thought something was off they did not think this was suicide from the beginning and they wanted the case file to look through but they were never given it what they did they were always denying then one day the case file actually was just released online in a downloadable file that anyone could access I have been tellin Chris and they're gonna release that case file Chris now I know they're not that people are saying they're gonna I'm like I'm telling you Chris they're gonna release this case file and did you expect the pictures no I mean again dami like that never ever enter my mind I mean to me was just the worst thing you can do to a parent that was like the most hurtful intentionally hurtful thing that anybody could ever do that was probably the worst situation I've ever been in barring be called and told about Christian just alright or when they came and told us about Christian because again it was just almost like you know just going through it all over again I feel like a lot of us I've changed a lot of us I mean we're all very hardened I guess very skeptical it's hard to trust people yeah it's hard to trust people especially the people that are supposed to protect you it's almost like they get the most distrust from from us because that's that's for the most part that's what we've been shown is that yeah the people that were supposed to trust the most yeah are the ones that we trust the least yeah but that's how I explained it is hardened we've all sort of become hardened in a way we're not the first family's ever lost a child and unfortunate Linkwood not gonna be the last but the biggest difference between this one and and nine percent of the other ones out there is that if you lose a child in a car wreck you can either blame the drunk driver or if they were drinking but you know they died in a car trip okay doesn't mean that the pains any more any less or any greater yeah but in this situation we don't know we don't know anything of what went on in that apartment from the time he got there until the time the police were called we don't know the innit the body was moved many it was raised where what more do you need to move in an investigation that castigation well and it wasn't six months six months after that the chief you know was relieved of duties for you know conduct unbecoming of an officer yeah is there anything that um do you think Avery would want to have said on her behalf so she knows she remembers she'll never forget you know it's always with her she's worked really hard you know to put things in its place and you know Avery will have her chapter two is gonna happen but Ray she doesn't have a temper too you can't say that right now Jesus you know what I'm saying yeah so um Avery she you know she sees good she's happy she's in a happy place no you know of course there's always the water two days a year they were really really extra tough you know this isn't a theory well it's not fair that's you know a child our child you may want my child he was a man but I won't write more than anything was start to get her justice yeah serves it yes you know like I said I agree she'll have her chapter two but you know ready to get her I won't ready to get her ending yeah unless she deserves a hundred percent wish it would have been that they would have made other decisions and that they would have never this would have not even ever happens there would be no funeral there would have been nobody sad or angry or you know whatever so it's just it's terrible and you hate it when a parent loses a child their world stops it is the closest thing to experiencing your own death while still living and breathing but you are living and breathing and you do still have other children and other responsibilities so you carry on time goes by and people move on to another tragedy or celebrate their own milestones you continue to tread water half of the time we should you be drowned and the other half of the time feeling guilty that you don't and time keeps it going by time that can heal most wounds but not all they say when you have a child die that you join the club that no one wants to be a member of when you have a child murdered you become a member of a club that is much smaller and comes with its own unique challenges one challenge that I did not expect and should not have expected was the fight to find justice for my child prior to my son's death I never had much interaction with law enforcement I thought I was right with the world overall ironic enough I voted for some of the people who later would betrayed me I foolishly thought most people are inherently good and would do the right thing people who I had helped many times when they were in crisis would later show me their true character any mother who's lost a child no matter what age it's a natural process it's something that we feel like is out of order that we should never really experience our child's death I think that it impacts everyone differently but very significantly in our case because of the way Christian with all Christian it his death has had a lot of in on the whole family I think that when you live in a community that is as divided as our community over Christians death that when you come home and you you can't come home to a sanctuary and come home you enter the gates of your community and you're looking at people who pass you and say you know whose side are they on what do they know I'm what have they been told and you you don't trust anyone and it's very difficult to live in that environment and know that that's where you go home - we've been then become victims of cyberbullying text messages that accuse us of things trying to spend and mislead people about our character and about our motives the release of the case file in the manner that it was released it was very helpful it was something that I will never get over it's something that my grandchildren will be able to pull up and Google Christians name and see things that they should never see if their uncle you know we've we've lost the ability to as a complete family share holidays together share birthdays you know there's always that missing piece there [Music] [Music] if you
