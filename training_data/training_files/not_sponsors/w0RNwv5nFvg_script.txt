over 18s only and please gamble responsibly big thank you also to slice-of-life christopher Messina Sean Evans Deadpool Mason canard and Grimley for their support on patreon if you would also like to support my content and have a chance to play with me and rust you can do so by going to my patreon page link below and if you do pledge to me on patreon make sure to message me in discord so this video features my group and I shopfront griefing and trolling to different clans one was the clan we initially went deep on this one of two videos ago the second comprised a larger 12 man group who were a threat to us because they kept guarding our base and they definitely had enough explosives to raid us I need to quickly clarify that we would never ever troll clans like this unless they deserved it the first group were super toxic and the second was a real threat to us so we wanted to force them to waste explosives on it and it just so happened that they turned out to be toxic as well most important to this video is that we also discovered what I think is a gamebreaking discord exploit in rust now admittedly this discord exploit was not intended by the game's designers it's a function of the new go live feature on discord that makes it possible and the rest of El Affairs couldn't have predicted its use in-game nor should the devs be too concerned since not everyone has a second gaming computer so not everyone is going to be able to try out this new surveillance strategy however the option to monitor both your enemies and your main base in rust is absolutely appealing this is a mighty tool of surveillance never seen before in rust you can place a second rusty key game and lime stream their experience on discord and anyone in the channel can view it what this means is that you can even keep surveillance on a place of interest in game and see what's going on while on the go with your cell phone and be able to check in whenever you want insofar as the bought doesn't die or disconnect I was honestly very hesitant to reveal this strategy but it was bound to get out there eventually now before I start the video I just want to say real quick that I want you all to know that I really appreciate you and that I hope you're all with loved ones during this holiday season whether they be family or friends so let's get to it o means the following is vanilla

and then we just like went deep randomly someone opened up the table we literally got everything and flew it on with two minutes Crusaders yeah he's pretty much the leader like I asked one of the like I guess you could say kind of leaders to a stops Indian word constantly like telling people to shut the [ __ ] up like 24/7 pretty much got kicked for that texted and chat or typed in chat and was

camera it's like the base let me turn off this cord oh oh you guys kind of see it's so loud gonna turn that down streaming in the disco channels he just he's in the shop from basically built it so in this limb that's honestly something I've never thought of but that's our o-p-s hell Soapy's hal you'd be like specs on a tree some of those you can see anything they're doing [ __ ] amateur settings and the motion blur that's how it comes when you're fresh is the rust and it's horrible SPS is horrible there's 980ti in a tube with i7 dude this is next [ __ ] level no one has ever ever ever ever done this in rust no one discord that's some [ __ ] even they ban alt accounts or they have to talk to [ __ ] discord or something even though like realistically speaking which nerd has two computers and he can't control like that there's some people that do have this but it's like even even on a laptop though like yeah all the kids to get like their laptop for university to do this for sure go down their desk while they're farming and [ __ ] I'm gonna come over to you you're gonna give me some wood and stone imma make a second-rate cam base [Music] remember the tower we built free do ya base with the bags yeah I could put it on top of there permanently and have this computer run permanently with a camera like [ __ ] eye in the sky and I would literally be able to see if we're getting raided anyone permanently even on our phones we can tune in a front mobile exactly dude exactly you'll always be able to know if we're getting raided by just joining the disco channel maybe that maybe facepunch knows about this that's what they do in the app this is cheaper the district feature is pretty recent that's crazy they should write these guys dude yeah of course girls it's finished come on down and then rate them they have no idea of like it's being streamed like they just think you're just chilling in the base dude you can also use this great camera like the footage I just put up [ __ ] to rate cams dog one in the hills so we got the roof axes that's so this this is our Christmas present to rest because this video good that's a beautiful picture that rest music though okay
