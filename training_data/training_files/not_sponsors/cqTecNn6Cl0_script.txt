warlords of the three kingdoms don't jaw game total war three kingdoms by the end of the second century the Han Dynasty was on the decline as had happened many times before in China's history this weakening of the central authority Yoda power back to the local level many will now seize their chance to shape their own destinies and a future of the Empire among the first to leave their mark would be dong zhuo warlord of Northwest China his actions would send motion the events of the Three Kingdoms period dong zhuo is born in the northwestern border commandery of long XI he will enter the military at a young age and eventually rise up to become a powerful figure serving first as an adept cavalry man he later became a member of the Imperial Guard before advancing to the post of major dong zhuo will soon prove his worth by successfully suppressing rebels in the Western Bing Province and was richly rewarded next he was promoted to the row of Korca tendon and then commandant of the center and then regional inspector of Bing Province and finally governor of the herd own commandery each position brought him more power influence and most importantly access to soldiers in 184 a very large uprising known as the Yellow Turban rebellion spread across the land dong zhuo was sent with an army to attack a contingent of rebels to his northeast however this operation would end in failure for the moment dong zhuo would be demoted before once again being elevated to suppress another rebellion this time to the west and Leon province that campaign proved difficult despite some initial success and outnumbered um jaw was forced to retreat only barely managing to escape alive with his army using a clever bit of maneuvering eventually the rebels would be defeated and dong zhuo was promoted to the rank of general he rejected a new post in Bing Province choosing instead to continue building up his base of power in Liang province this territory was strategically important due to its control over the Silk Road trade route and its ability to act as a buffer against the peoples of the steppe many wars have been fought in the area and the fierce young new tribes repeatedly launched assaults across the frontier as a result the commanders and soldiers stationed on the border who were toughened by the conditions and could deploy a large number of battle-hardened troops by choosing to remain here dong zhuo earned the respect of these powerful men in a letter to the court he is recorded as saying my soldiers both great and small have grown familiar with me over a long time and cherishing my sustaining bounty they will lay down their lives for me such loyalty would prove quite valuable for dong Zhuo in the years to come back at the Han Capital of law young things were deteriorating Emperor Ling D was struggling to stamp out the rebellions sweeping his land and he was forced to grant more power to provincial governments so they could better handle the situation this helped temporarily but ultimately it only further eroded his authority soon several regions of the Empire effectively declared their independence and as if things weren't bad enough Emperor Ling D died in the year 189 without an appointed heir and this set off a struggle over succession within the capital one of the main factions in this political conflict was that of the court eunuchs they had long been the feature of the imperial court but in the last few decades a group of eunuchs known as the ten attendants had managed to consolidate great power this group now leveraged their position to place their preferred monarch on the throne and further tightened their grip over the government thus the former Emperor's eldest son Leo PN was anointed emperor at the age of seventeen many fear that the eunuchs would wield even greater power through the young rulers and so plotted against them one of the chief conspirators summoned don't draw urging him to bring troops to the capital to remove the usurpers not one to let a good crisis go to waste the frontier general made his move while dongju marched his army down the Yellow River events at the capital continued to unfold the conspiracy against a unix was discovered and ringleader courage in the region marshal was called to appear before the Empress wary of the danger hurt in events with an armed guard of five hundred men but once he left them to enter the palace gates alone hidden assassins emerged from the shadows and proclaimed him a traitor her gene was killed and his sever head was thrown over the palace walls this violent move sparked a response in kind from the remaining conspirators outside they forced their way through the gates bursting into the palace and butchering the eunuchs and their families as they ran in the chaos the Emperor's family was shuffled out a back gate and into the countryside once it became apparent that the uprising had been a success they try to return to the capital but at that very moment don't Joe and his army arrived the frontier general now intercepted the imperial caravan and escorted it back to law young even though this was done under the guise of protecting the crown it was apparent to all who held a real power in this delicate moment dong zhuo entered a capital under arms and is reported to have ordered his troops to re-enter the city a second time - over all its inhabitants with fear as his tool he then said about taking over law Yong dong zhuo's first major move was to propose replacing the current emperor with his younger brother some high officials stood up to a post II general in response dong zhuo's solicited the support of the famous warrior lubu convincing him to kill his former lord and switch sides together they would crush all opposition with the new young puppet emperor shin on the throne dong zhuo declared himself Chancellor and assumed control of the imperial capital the warlord turned ruler immediately made his power known troops were unleashed on the city killing many and ushering in a reign of terror within the palace that general is said to have dis boiled many time-honored traditions carrying weapons to court sleeping in the Emperor's bed and claiming many palace maids as his own this thing on the legacy of the Han would not go unpunished warlords from across the empire now rose up to oppose the tyrannical usurper this coalition will launch an assault on the capital dong zhuo's sent out his own generals and armies in opposition the two sides clashed in a series of battles at strategic positions leading to law young legends tell of many great duels between famous warriors taking place at this time eventually the pressure proved to be too much and don't draw chose to fall back to the more defensible city of Chang'an in the West he vacua Tanakh only the army but the inn tires civilian population as well looting and burning the capital in the process not even the tombs of the former Han Emperor's were spared when coalition forces finally reach Lou young they found it in a pitiful state of destruction rather than attempt to even garrison the ruins the armies of the coalition chose to retreat but not all was lost to the flames as the Imperial seal would be recovered from amongst the ashes this hugely important symbol of imperial authority was carried off by the coalition general Sun Jian as the war dragged on coalition forces increasingly saw each other as rivals and potential threats the scheming led to internal conflict and disarray which slowed the campaign to a crawl some warlords were determined to keep up the fight while others returned home the initiative was thus handed back to dong Zhuo who now sent his three generals back into battle these commanders and their armies defeated the lingering elements of the coalition this DeLillo to prevent the further crumbling of the Han Empire but ensure that dong Zhuo will walk away with control of the most prized piece the Emperor dong-chul is now left to shore up his position at Chang An from here he will rue the Han domains by taking control of the Emperor and the Imperial bureaucracy this will be achieved through a brutal policy of intimidation internal threats were routed out systematically with capture enemy's being executed in horrific public displays amid the thousands of murders dong zhuo had the entire UN clan one of the most distinguished families at court exterminated as retribution for the fact that one of their members un shell was the leader of the coalition these bloody purges would continue for nearly two years with vacancies being filled by yes-men and members of dong zhuo's own family such heavy-handed tactics however only built greater resentment among the people who would need to be kept in line with even more tyrannical measures ultimately this was only possible so long as dong Zhuo maintain the support of his army opponents of the tyrant recognized this and sought to drive a wedge between dong Zhuo and his military supporters a prime target for such subterfuge was Lee boo who had been a loyal servant and bodyguard of the general according to legend a plot was formed by Interior Minister Wang Jun to turn the two men against each other using his own dollar Dell Qian XI was secretly offered in marriage to both parties while whispering to each proud warrior that her heart belonged to him alone dong Zhuo and lapooh ultimately came to blows thinking the other was attempting to steal away their bride-to-be real history was a little less dramatic tension between Lee boo and dong Zhuo rose from two main sources first dong Zhuo had a bad temper and would often take it out on lubu going so far as to throw weapons at him on one occasion lebu dodged the weapons but not forget the insult at the same time leepu an affair with one of those jaws made and was afraid that the latter would find out so when wong Yuna and other conspirators came calling lubu was receptive to their calls on the morning of May 22nd in 192 dong zhuo approached the palace he had been notified that the emperor was about to hand the throne over to him but this was a trap upon entering the gate Lee boo in a gang of hand-picked soldiers surrounded him the once-mighty general was forced to his knees he cried out Julio for help instead his former servant walked up and declared I have an imperial decree to slay the rebel and with that lebu plunged his halberd into the throat of dong Zhuo while his reign was short dong Zhuo had done much to set in motion the events that would follow most importantly he had unmasked the true weakness of de han and proved that within the force one could capture the emperor and thus claimed the Empire this idea once seated in the minds of the people would be almost impossible to reverse each passing month of usurpation made a restoration of the dynasty less likely and emboldened others to follow in dong zhuo's ambitious footsteps after all the
