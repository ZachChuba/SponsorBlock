alright guys so I've seen tons of Minecraft videos on YouTube where the people play minecraft but with a specific rule minecraft but every item is random on minecraft but I I'm a zombie I I don't I don't know what I just said so today I wanted to try play minecraft hardcore mode with only 1% health basically this right here is 1% health the lowest amount of health you can get in Minecraft I tried playing this a few times but I actually only sent my health - I think negative 1% health and I was just dying randomly and I was really confused how did we die what happened we've solved the issue and we're gonna be playing minecraft hardcore mode with 1% health but first I'd like to shout good luck on your raid shadow legends and I hope to see you there and we've spawned on in a jungle that I'm gonna die so the way to play this game mode is you click open to land and you allow cheats in the way you can you know change the game up the first command is gonna be slash game rule natural regeneration and you're gonna want to turn that to false so basically you're not gonna naturally regenerate health meaning once I set my health to one percent there's no going back and then the command for one percent health is this command here so basically I don't know what it does but it's in the description if you want to copy it over as you can see even though it looks like I have health I don't I've got nineteen point nine max health meaning I don't have any help at all so anyway it's time to start our minecraft journey with one percent of health as you can see apparently puts a button on your head and well I've just ruined the whole game for me nice let's do that command again good to go so I haven't played minecraft survival for a long time I'm talking like six years so obviously they've added a lot of new stuff and I don't really know how to use any of it so this is gonna be a learning experience for me but anyway the objective of this game is obviously to kill the Ender Dragon that is winning minecraft and that is the end goal of this of this video so I'm gonna try a speedrun it and try to do it as quick as I can need some food don't I know what's the point I really don't want to come in the water because I know they've got like water zombies now and I don't want to die so I really want to get out of jungle biome as well because I feel like I'm gonna die at full damage somehow one of these cats are gonna kill me or something like that like you have no idea how paranoid you get playing this game mode it is it is scary man I literally couldn't have spawned in a worse environment though jungle this is terrible throw it we found a melon that should help and we got a cave here so instead of looking for a village or what is bamboo what can we do with that instead of looking for a village we might as well start our adventure here and deal with what we've been given get some tools and try to kill the dam into dragon with this much health get a sword that is probably the most important thing so we don't die get a pickaxe of course what am i doing so I think before nightfall hit so I'm gonna actually try to get out of this damn jungle biome now what can you actually do a bamboo there's so much of this I want to try get every advantage I can in this game mode so that involves trying to find a structure rebuild a structure with chests so I can easily get ahead with items especially when it's daytime and there's no creepers trying to kill me and it looks like we're coming up to a desert biome over here somewhere so that is that will be quite handy with trying to find a village or a sand temple I'm really never this careful in Minecraft so this is a whole new experience for me and what I'm watching you cactus I know you're out to kill me oh these pandas I've never seen minecraft pandas before they're probably gonna kill me so I'm going to stay away I think the game has finally acknowledged the fact that I only have 1% health and that's why it's sort of changed the graphic there hopefully I can find like a cave or a ravine or just something to get me started I mean that looks promising but I don't want to die so I'm not doing that no it's just like an hindrance to my naft I've never seen this before there's there's gold there there's lava oh god this looks awesome but scary is at the same time Oh a chest awesome just look around make sure it's safe and we got a chance at golden apples so that might actually break the game so don't know whether I should use that I don't know guys should I explore the mineshaft here or should I continue on with my journey alright I'll go on with the I'll go on with the mineshaft I suppose and and I'll die in five minutes in so this is my first time really seeing anything like this in my car oh my god this this is sketchy I feel like the way I'm gonna die in this game is through an accidental block glitch or something like that which is not cool but at the same time you know that's just what minecraft is all about so or another minecart please give me some diamonds beetroot seeds beetroot seeds alright so since it's nighttime that obviously means I'm blocking myself in and we're calling it a night so I decided to do just a little bit of mining and after a few minutes I found one of these oh crap you know what up [ __ ] what a [ __ ] this is actually terrifying if I'm high there's a small one there's a smaller there's a small and there's a small and there's a small one project thanks you know I'll take it anyway it'll it'll help I suppose just take this chest take that take that take some blast protection it's not gonna [ __ ] help at all alright well we don't need to risk our life anymore so let's just get out of here oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god that works that make us everyone was slain by cave spider alright attempt to after getting established here we found some lava we've got a quite a bit of items kind of a helmet though so I've got a few items here and what we are going to do is we're going to try to get some obsidian now obviously if I touch this lava I die wheat that's a fact but what I think I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do the traditional method of making a an end portal not an end portal I'm what am I talking about and why do I keep unlocking recipes I'm gonna do the old-school method of making a never portal without a diamond pickaxe and you know mining the obsidians if we get some lava and put some lava there and we get some lava and put some lava there and then we tip a bit of water here but BOM will get a bit of obsidian like that let's try this one more time and hopefully we don't die that's what I'm talking about like that and put that in there cool drop this butt bone and everything should be good I'm the biggest [ __ ] idiot that minecraft has ever come across aww alright let's try that again so is this when I was stealing I'm talking it right and we need to get you put you there and we need to get you and we need to put you there and but but okay that is more like it I think I and now we've got the hard task of getting some damn Flint so how the hell are my god this just does not get easier for poor old man make a seven it just does not get easier with brilliant okay that is just beginner's luck now realistically I don't know if I should be going into the never about diamond but um I don't care I don't care oh I can hear aghast I can hear aghast how do you find it never Fortress that is um that was something I would like to know and awesome bro I'm so good at this game it just keeps getting easier and easier I'm sure I don't die from full damage hold on I think we can realistically build straight across because I don't believe there are any gassed around at the minute you know we're not actually not actually doing this we're we're we're taking the safer route oh I nearly died a full damage I swear apparently when you shift dimensions you need to type the command again so I didn't notice that my bad come on guys this is a learning experience for me as well as my first time doing this challenge it's I don't know what I'm doing alright now we can build up to the fortress and hopefully find some blaze find a blaze spawner I really don't know how I'm gonna fight the blaze without dying but we'll figure that out when we get there I'll what the I could really go with a bow and arrow right now but I don't know oh I see I see so there right there he can see me maybe if we go from below and go underneath them that might be the best plan of attack Oh God we're literally right here and if I place to that like that surely you know I'm here come on you little [ __ ] come all your [ __ ] oh god damn we've actually killed a blaze alright well there's not exactly a spawner here so that doesn't really help all too much what up punks what up punk I think I play way too risky to ever win this I've got a percentage of health and you still can't kill me I think I need to find a spawner I think that's the only way I'm actually going to oh never walk that'll help that's realistically I believe the only way that I'll be able to kill a lot of them at a time and we are we have hit it so we know what you're probably thinking mad make a seven you're dead well that's that's that's fair really at this point in time I didn't I didn't know what just happened I suddenly just walked off the edge yeah I know I know it may have looked intentional but I'm just stupid so after two attempts I decided to call it quits for this challenge and this is just this picture right here summarizes the challenge so realistically that's that's all there is to it you want to try this challenge for yourself I'm gonna leave all the all the commands in the description of this video go ahead and do it if you want hey I can make a video on it if you can beat me I'm sure your bloody can but regardless guys thank you for watching this video if you want to hit that like button hoe down I'd appreciate that a lot and hey even subscribe if you want I'm never playing minecraft again son of a mother
