check them out the link is in the description below so I'm gonna be randomly selecting one patreon supporter later tonight and announcing them in my discord to play a full wipe with me beginning in June you're going to be featured in a new series that I make for the wipe if you would like a chance to play with me and my team and be in a new series check out my patreon you can choose any tier of support on my patreon to be entered into the random draw I'm also going to be doing this contest monthly so if you don't win you have another chance next month my patreon link is also down below so I want to impart a quick message about racism in the games we play before we start the video why can't the expanding online gaming community contribute to curbing races toxicity we don't have to be complicit speaking out is better than letting racist trolls exist without opposition I believe we can view more as a gaming community and we should when I talk to teenagers in game one-on-one about being racist they know what's wrong and say it's only a joke but I don't believe a joke makes it right and they agree when you connect to someone's humanity you focus on what's right and wrong sure aggression is intrinsic to rust we can't shoot a gun to kill an enemy shooting back at us without wanting them to die the concept of rating one another for loot and domination is normal in this game it's also not hypocritical to understand these normal reactions to the game if we see the errors in toxicity that lead people to these extreme forms of personal hate this experience I had is the closest thing to an example of racism in the community that I have experienced I do not want any of you to bring hate towards anyone in this video but I hope that in sharing it we can mutually agree that we can do better than this as a collective I believe we are in charge of shaping the social environment that we game in and spend much of our lives enjoying you can be aggressive in a video game like this without resorting to racist toxicity our battles do not need the depth of racism I believe we're better than that and if you don't then part of you is given up on who we're capable of being I hope you enjoyed today's video the following is vanilla [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yoke Judoon your elbows um putting bags down for Gumby and I they're [ __ ] racist and I'm I want to make a video about them yeah they started to killed off what there was on the pop yeah they were rating rebar base - um I didn't know that they had a cave base so they may yeah they didn't have a key base their main so they may check in the base sure in the cave of me but yeah they are around our base they're in the water they just rated like a 3x3 they might still be doing it see bad we don't have DB and red bullet so i totally go chai yeah wow this leg on the cervix crazy gonna be and I each have two bags over here you find their main base or something yeah it's p9 oh that one on the beach in Tier one zone I was thinking bring tools over here just for our mouth like some wood in the stone and just like keep building a little base you outside there's and make them read it if you just refresh spawn over here you're good because it's always like [ __ ] near their base whose farm in Laguna [Music] I found a random furnace so I'm gonna use it just to make some co bucks I got a dorms getting this good look oh you imagined this oh we could shake I kind of build out all their bread bullets yeah they're in the tower so I'm not gonna head over there [Music] just yeah let's let's just do it here maybe and then we can use this as a base of operations with like guns and [ __ ] [Music] they've like 3m twos up in that Tower so that's somewhat airbase speakerphone oh the space totally decane there's so much I got a lot of it but there's still some [ __ ] here we got enough low-grade there's some mini copter right near us we're gonna fly it all conviction home - we can probably learn DB and red bullet but so I'm still carping yeah I can already learn BB with the scrap I have yeah I got 335 first time I ever had to climb a tree to get away from a wolf okay I'm just

backup and want you to watch for each bothering these turrets off yeah just getting this one recording to like they're just proving my point any food yeah there's some core and I think out here I'll pick you something it's all right bad [ __ ] oh there's one here that'll up there there's two are you in the base yeah yeah check the body yeah this is they like to use people's bodies as loose charges I don't have access to external TCS though that's fine they can't do [ __ ] man everything's will move it all down to the cave he's just spamming the n-word there's one bag left Gumby have that recorded know I'm a record which whoever good it is just spamming the n-word in chat and voice shut yeah where is he where is he done now we should just give this to the noobs on the server gasp eating slop got [ __ ] over though yeah he did practically everyone on the server did it's true am i saying anything that's not true no it's what they said to blue when they're raiding this is [ __ ] up what they said oh yeah I was pulling or or and some sexist type of shoes but you understand burnt these guys are like toxic yeah and they're just not people you everyone associated with they're not gonna change they're just 3ds community it's really good man yeah we're not like that at all whatsoever variant yeah thank you guys it would be did you guys see the loot up here up here yeah I didn't up there he's chicken I remember you did yeah I can guarantee you burnt you're gonna have way more fun with us buddy did you guys find c4 in the base that rated us right yeah yeah it was 14 or 18 c4 yeah dude they see forward our base with like 16 they were [ __ ] what's all that God dude that's a lot of that's the only BP they had for explosives or something yeah most of them are races wide in what the [ __ ] out about is he racist he can be at times who's who's the most racist acting all buddy-buddy cuz yeah dude I want to talk to that guy where is he we came here just to chill dude but then we saw you guys in chat being racist so he's farmed it up I've never met like a more racist player in rusty not gonna lie you sound so [ __ ] toxic and shy did [Music] if you never said that word at all and you didn't spam it I wouldn't give a [ __ ] did I wouldn't I wouldn't be in your [ __ ] kit right now I wouldn't be in your base deep in your cave basic all right man well all right yeah I never ever inside Clint's and I got incited once then I quit roster to monsoon I [ __ ] hate it but I only did it because of the racism yeah I only did it cause of that [ __ ] yeah it sounds like [ __ ] fell apart when this happened but maybe it's for the best dude who kicked you who were the leaders whose aim Joe I'm Konya Mickey Mickey who's a [ __ ] racist pursued it's usually what you given when you play with like young kids in a big group yeah I don't know why it's like seeing as cool these days I don't either toxicity needs to be wiped away maybe the next time they would be like okay maybe we should yeah yeah I mean they will always remember this this is probably one of the worst heli powers I've ever seen though I said that when I first looked at it I'm like man that lets me in the desert his only knees are just build a two-by-two le and then they refine the design like everyone's a play but yeah I mean it does the job but like ya know we don't own that shop dude we're not I'm not gonna kill you I'm like to kill you is this what's up dude yeah the gut we just we just took this base over but they have turrets in there we don't have so I don't know I can't open that up I don't know what the [ __ ] you're gonna have to drain the turret and then buy it I guess what do you need come up here come up here just don't go in the entrance just gonna give them a star quick you got one yeah this handle in here I did go free sorry yeah brother hey we took some of the loot but we left something here because we didn't want to hog it all they were [ __ ] loaded so come up here come up here did these guys radio at all we [ __ ] we incited them consider races bricks they rated you yeah I figured two plus ammo if I just killed you then it's dirty yeah man you know you glad could help you out yes for sure magic bullet and Kevin yo what's up man we took some of the loop but there's lots of remaining dudes so come in here you're not gonna get shot the turret son of ammo
