hey everyone you a tesla tom and welcome to my youtube channel where we talk about all things tesla's electric vehicles and renewable energy the worst case scenario is that you just unsubscribe later today we're going to talk about the tesla autopilot crash on a taiwanese all right guys well if you haven't seen the tesla model 3 crash on a taiwanese freeway here it is right now let's watch it together okay so at the time of this poster there hasn't been too many official details from tesla themselves so all i'll do today is to speculate and analyze based on a couple of pieces of footage and also some images from the crash itself first thing i'll say about this video is that it happened on a sunny day and that's important too and i'll tell you why in a second there are a few shadows on the road so there's a shadow from what appears to be a bridge or an overpass before the side of the crash there are some shadows on the lane that the white model 3 is in i assume it's coming from the bushes in the median divider of the freeway the car is driving on the left-most lane of this freeway and because taiwan drives on the right hand side of the road that's the fastest lane you won't see it on this bit of footage but when i show the other footage from the other angle the truck is white from the top and that's also very important the road itself it looks like it's a dip because the car seems to be coming downhill and then on the reverse image or the reverse footage the road goes up again and turns to the right and that's also important i'll tell you why in a second i guess news reports have come forward claiming that the driver was an autopilot and that's what the driver has said themselves i don't know whether the car is on autopilot or navigate autopilot i don't think it makes too much of a difference because it's still lane keeping there's no freeway exits very close by that i can see um so it shouldn't matter there's something called phantom braking and that happens when the car sees shadows and that's why i pointed out shadows before i've demonstrated that before in our model 3 on autopilot when there are shadows on the road particularly when the sun is high the car can sometimes phantom break like it will want to break as it's seeing a shadow on the road and that doesn't seem to lend support to this case because you know had the car seen um something on the road a difference in the shape of the road whether it be a plate or a shadow it might have jumped it might have stopped but from the footage that i can see this this y model 3 in the left lane seems to be actually getting faster until it reaches the person in the middle of the freeway near the divider who i can only assume is the driver of the truck um so once that car passes the drive of the the person in that middle of the road then the brakes come on you can see the skidding from the car and and this and the smoke coming from the road itself and i can only assume that's the braking from the car whether that's um the car activating emergency braking or the human has actually taken over to to finally stop the car now it's hard to know what the driver was doing at the time and that's why i always say on autopilot whether you're on basic autopilot or navigate an autopilot or even cruise control it's not automated driving you have to always pay attention it's not a judgment on what that person was doing but whether they were doing something else i i can't i can't be sure but certainly if if you were paying full attention while an autopilot and certainly when i try to demonstrate that using my videos i'm very careful i'm always actually hypervigilant when i'm on autopilot because knowing that it's not autonomous driving just yet anecdotally i have seen um not in australia but when i've driven in the us i've seen people in tesla's texting while on autopilot on the freeway and that freaks me out a little bit um i don't think that's on i certainly do not condone that behavior at all when you're on autopilot keep attention at all times i don't know what this driver was doing i guess we'll never know unless they had some sort of in-car recording device uh and even if they did i assume that's probably lost now so we just don't know luckily that person survived so we're thankful for that um so that's that's the driver's side of things i guess the other thing i want to talk about too is the road itself so as i said before from this front angle you can see that the road actually dips down so there's actually a slope down towards the accident site and then i'll show you the reverse footage where you'll see that the cut the road actually bends to the right and possibly goes uphill again once it get part gets past the truck so that's important because from the car's point of view when when you see what happens on the screen the car actually you know it actually tries to estimate where it should be um so it'll sort of estimate with line of best fit so to speak with the autopilot lines and it will try and try and just you know try and find out where the next part of rotus so it's always looking forward so whether the truck um you know didn't actually appear to the car as a major obstacle you know it's maybe it just couldn't differentiate whether it was a small blockage that they could get or get over quickly or the weather it was a large obstacle and again that's important because if you're on a dip looking down from the car you can't judge perspective as well the truck may actually only appear to be a small obstacle from far away um which is why possibly the car only just broke automatically when it got too close to the vehicle the other important thing too is from this angle the truck is white it's actually very close in color to the rest of the road and looking at the auto pilot cameras when you're on sentry mode or dash cam you know it if if that is the color gradient or of those cameras and that's what the autopilot is using then i'm very doubtful as to whether uh with the truck overturned the car would have actually differentiated the road from the truck color because the color is not very good um with the autopilot cameras so i guess all these things amount to the fact that you know if the driver wasn't paying attention and just relying on the car's um full self-driving capabilities then yes i can see that the car could possibly have hit the truck if if the human didn't override it quickly enough and as you've seen with my recent roundabout video um yeah not that time just drive drive right through it that drove straight over the roundabout again the car will try and estimate where the road is after the roundabout and it doesn't actually stop for the roundabout this stage it'll just drive right over as i've demonstrated before so uh you know maybe that's what happened maybe the car was trying to drive over the truck and not knowing not knowing where the truck was in space like how how high the truck was or um what the perspective of the truck was compared to the rest of the road especially when it's on that down slope like that and then the road goes back up again and if it's at the bottom of a hill so yeah that's i guess that's my um that's my analysis guys of where of where the driver or where the car of where the car would have gone wrong if it was an autopilot and didn't see this truck which is another lesson for me and for you guys if you're watching this if you're on a tesla to always pay attention when you're driving on autopilot or freeway or on the city road at this stage it's just for me not 100 quite there yet and this is certainly another example of where uh you know humans still need to pay attention when driving tesla's on autopilot all right guys well that is uh my analysis of the taiwan freeway crash with the tesla model 3. i'm very thankful that no one got hurt from this video and i'm glad the driver is okay but let it be listen to you guys moving forward all right guys well thank you very much for watching i hope you enjoyed that if you've liked this video please give it a thumbs up um and also leave a comment too if you've had a near miss or an accident on autopilot uh driving your teslas around and what lessons have you learned from driving on autopilot as well thanks for watching guys stay safe take care and until next time happy charging you
