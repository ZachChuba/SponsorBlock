whole day with a free offer here's your video welcome to a video about the origin of golems where I run through some weird story about a rabbi and then I tell you where the concept is nowadays the history of golems begins with a single verse in Psalms 139 verse 16 that's right idiot all the cult DMVs [ __ ] and fantasy creatures we have now comes from religion I'll be using religion a little bit to illustrate the video because that's what history was so let's read the Bible for two seconds before I make some poof jokes speaking in reference to the Lord it states you saw me when I was yet unformed look to my future and saw all my numbered days that part about being unformed is also translated as not complete unborn primordial unfinished or stupid the original word was golem which means date from filthy Frank was a golem but his words go the base definition of not entirely there gained the meaning of both an unborn baby and someone whose brain function is on a level equal to 3/4 of a lemming but if you know our origin story that naked do that God made that turned into Gus Johnson and Sven were unformed made from clay and then he stole one of our ribs and slathered in barbecue sauce but I digress to a degree the first guy who was alive was made of mud and fire fire and mud were clay golems okay we're at were actual we're all golems all of us you and me the same thing happened with prometheus story but he stole the fire instead of making it and got horribly punished for creating us I mean look where we are now Prometheus really [ __ ] up and I almost think he deserves it we figured out how to make our own fire and now Australia stepping away from us as a failed race the definition of golems became mindless clay constructs created by men with some degree of divine power before I delve into a couple of really amazing stories let's look at common traits of golems firstly they can only be created by Jewish wizards rabbis sages whose practices brings them closer to divinity and grants them authority over creation which is exactly what clerics do interesting world we live in isn't it secondly they work based on true name magic these true names are oaths are tied to the Hebrew word Shem which means true name there's a whole bunch of info about how they range from 4 to 72 letters and that God's four-letter name used to be Tetragrammaton which is the coolest name for a Pokemon or a transformer or like a like a big dinosaur that I think I've ever heard as an addendum to that second detail the names were inscribed on golems or on their activation stones which could be removed to kind of turn them off ok now we're getting to the fun part because there are a handful of stories about golems having superpowers and then going apeshit golem number 1 The Golem who got too big our first rabbi who I will be calling a divine wizard solely because it's more interesting to me was a polish wizard whose name was something close to Elijah he was a master of true name magic and created a man from clay in order to do hard labor how badass is that this is a story based in our history about a wizard who made a clay thug to do his bidding he placed a true name on its neck Emmett I believe the Hebrew word Ahmet means truth usually used in the recited blessing and met of Ayotte's off' which just means god equals true as this rabbis descendants recently told the story the golem started growing at an alarming rate too swelling up like a giant Baby Bowser before the rabbi's final fight on Yoshi back in the climax of the story he pulled the true name from the golems neck and the entire thing was disintegrated and turned to dust like Thanos the fact that this story has no lesson aside from maybe hubris makes me feel like it's real I don't know the Golem of Prague was the reason I made this video and it had the working title of history check but who the [ __ ] gonna click on that Judah Loew Ben Bezalel the residing Jewish wizard of Prague created a powerful golem made from clay from a nearby river you know that real big important River who cares but but he built it to [ __ ] but he built it too and I quote defend the ghetto from anti-semites and pogroms the power word truth was also written on his forehead but the Shem which I assume was the golems name was placed in its mouth his name was Joseph or Yosef or ela he could supposedly not be slain by any weapon of that age could become invisible at his own will and summon the spirits of the Dead like holy fuzzy moonlit cow poop imagine being a Roman grunts sent to the dirty and dingy ghetto to exterminate a few people because your Emperor is racist and then having an eight-foot-tall clay man appear out of thin air bend your sword like a copper wire and then call upon all the spirits of the Dead to destroy your body in the name of God I would be very scared as the story goes in the way that makes the most sense to me the rabbi would remove the activation Shem every Sunday so the Golem wouldn't desecrate the Sabbath which is kind of hilarious to me because this mean the rules of golems were as follows you make it in the name of God to serve God God allows you to make it and design its purpose but because you made it and not God it's too stupid to respect God and if it tries to defend Prague during God's day of rest everybody loses control of it and that's what happened one day our good friend and wizard Lowe drank too much Saturday wine and during his hangover forgot to pluck out the golems name so it went apeshit destroyed the ghetto it was protecting and kept going until the rabbi removed its chemin it fell to pieces [Music] then they put it in an attic and that's where the story ends well there was a rumor that a Nazi went upstairs to poke it and they found him dead also the Attic is off-limits to close out the video I'll give a little brief of how they've translated into modern fantasy golems are now elemental spirits trapped in small objects of arcane powers such as gemstones or runic inscriptions it sounds familiar doesn't it once the spirit is trapped the body of the golem itself acts as a machine created to do its master's bidding as long as the spirit is kept under control after taking enough damage in combat or erosion over time the spirit regains its sentience and tries to destroy everything nearby until it is freed by its own body being destroyed expanding on that concept of a golems rage I'd love to add the idea to our stories where the trapped spirits just need a rest day that'd be pretty cool I guess ok go enjoy some credits and then another video or listen to that audio book or look for my book ok bye you
