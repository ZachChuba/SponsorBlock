the dragon hunter crossbow a weapon that gives you an accuracy and damage boost of 30 when fighting dragons and draconic creatures it has a hefty price tag of 87 million gp is it worth selling your bank to buy one let's find out we've sold our bank we have absolutely nothing no items at all no money no bolts nothing i'm not going to be using any untradables either because i want this to be completely from scratch so we're not just going to go and grab out void and then go around and void nope we're gonna have to make everything we use so we're gonna have to earn our first few gps probably through pickpocketing or something so that we can buy ourselves some bolts and then we can get into a little bit of combat okay that's enough i went and got myself 75 arrows from the ge because i'm going to get myself an avers uh device because i don't really want to be wasting bolts and obviously we're going to need neighbors later on when we're using higher quality bolts right ava if i could have one of these devices thank you very much unfortunately we can't get that yet but we will definitely be doing some ball cap at some point and maybe we'll get a lucky head and we can upgrade the accumulator and while i make sure you join now and with the 66 gp left over i think buying pink skirts is probably going to be a fairly good way of making some money g average 68 okay maybe not cool let's go and sell all this and see how much profit gonna make and hopefully buy some broad bolts so we can start uh using this dragon hunter crossbow right let's collect that to start with 733 gp course it is there we go the blue skirt wow something just sold for a lot what was that 1k each okay there you go money maker if you're watching this go and uh go and sell those off quickly anyway let's get ourselves some broad bolts and we should be good to go from here and with the rest of the money i'm going to buy myself a teleport to house nice just picked up a machete from the general store because we need to get through the web in the fourth house dungeon uh so that we can get to the red dragons i think they're gonna be a fairly decent place to start we can safe spot them um and then we'll probably move on to black dragons after or brutal black dragons because they are going to be banging gp so from here we could just save spot use our rigger and there is an altar right there to get the prayer back it's a very very nice place to come afk when you're on a rebuild and uh especially using a dragon hunter crossbow this is gonna be very very quick kills first kill coming in and we get ourselves some room that's actually a really decent drop to go alongside that's a nice 26 to take plus a 14. all right that's probably gonna do let's have a look yeah 20k right there let's check our home teleport we'll probably have to run back to the ge now because i didn't really have enough money to buy some teleports but we're looking pretty good we're about 15 minutes in now and uh we're well on our way to start making some decent gp there we go 20k and we're going to get ourselves an extended anti-fire for about 500 gp there i'm gonna pick up myself can we get a black d-hide set we can afford a black dehyde set as well so let's pick that up 4k left over and you know what i think we're ready to go and hit some brutal black dragons up a couple of kills here will easily easily pay for everything we've got here i think a kit was around 20k so let's see how we do with our black d hide broad bolts and the dragon hunter crossbow imagine not buying a ranging pot like what was i thinking anyway first drop is gonna be a dragon medal very very nice i'm actually gonna pop off back to the ge i'm gonna get myself a uh ranging potion just because that was such a dumb thing not to buy but that has a very nice starting drop uh let's do a quick price check on it so you guys can uh see exactly what we're looking at there 67k from one kill that is just so so nice i'm gonna get myself a glory with that money we just made as well so let's quickly grab that gives us some teleports around as well very very nice uh is there anything else i could go ahead and buy i think we might get ourselves an archers home how much are they at the moment 39k yeah we can always sell it back let's take it it looks so iconic i love it and we'll get some snakeskin boots because they are super cheap let's fire on back okay that is going to be an inventory done oh and a dragon long sword we will take that very very nice to be honest guys i'm not 100 sure but i think we could be vocath ready so uh i'm going to send it back to the ge we're going to set all this off see how much we've made um and yeah if we've got enough to go hit vorkath then why not because it's one of the best money makers in the game and if you can go from nothing literally pickpocketing guards to make enough money for an avers to warcraft in 35 minutes then uh this dragon hunter crossbow is massively worth buying so let's go ahead and do it looks like we're gonna hit 200k i know just short 200k very very nice i might actually go ahead and sell this i feel like one of the uh like zamarak d hide coifs might actually be like cheaper slash better 40k yeah let's uh buy one of those let's sell this back and let's start getting some gear together okay so we've got some sharks prayer potions some bolts uh both the diamond and ruby versions and then we got the runes so we can cast crumble undead i think we're ready to go to be honest i think we can kill vorkath let's give it a go right here we go let's set up the quick prez and uh let's see how this goes we are wrecking it we are wrecking raw cath like disgusting amounts that is insane how good that is i didn't bring a bloody anti-venom we're going to try and get the kill i knew i forgot something i knew there was something i forgot there we go there's the kill and obviously we took way more damage than we were meant to because we had the venom on us and that is such a nice start dragon plate legs to kick us off i'm gonna head back home and uh we're gonna bring an anti-venom obviously but i want to start there that is 190k the first kill from vorkath and it's easily doable if we had an anti-venom with us we'd be looking at easy 2-3 kill trip there that is a two-kill trip uh probably could go for a third uh just didn't really bring enough prayer to be honest so i might need to bring three prayer pots in future but let's do a quick price check of how much we made on this trip 247k not bad at all okay i think we can get ourselves a carol's top uh actually it might be a skirt actually yeah it's got 211k so there's our first upgrade if we could have bought it uh the reason for this is just a better magic defense um it actually gives the same range attack bonus but i still want to get my uh wow what is going on with the carol's leather skirt there we go well over price we paid for that but that is gonna be nice giving us that seven plus magic defense and the range very very nice hey i had to record this one for kiddos there's the dragon battle axe let me do a little price check on this uh double kill we're getting double kills every time now guys but uh this was a really good one i believe 347k from two kills that is insane so because we're making so much money i upgraded to manta rays and to a bastion potion and the difference they have made is huge so if you are planning on a rebuild like this there are two things you really should be aiming for i think the bastion is just you know just something else massive and that is gonna be a three kill trip pretty slow kill on the last one because i had to flick the prayer but a decent decent drop we'll take that that's gonna be a lovely trip let's check this this could put us into the territory of being able to afford our fury which would probably be one of the biggest upgrades we make 251k there i don't know if that's quite going to be enough let's go have a look at the bank so we're up to 1.438 i don't think that is going to be enough yeah it's just short just short but it doesn't matter because they're gonna buy some uh dragon bolts at the moment anyway because they're a bit low on those it's a big upgrade coming in it is now the fury we can buy let's go ahead and purchase this bad boy can we get it for that price we can't okay that's annoying this is going to give us more prayer and it's going to give us more defense absolutely huge the stats looking really really nice now we're looking decent the next things i want to upgrade is a carol's top and probably some ancient boots and then we're looking pretty pretty good and this is going to be a four kill trip which is the most we have achieved as long as we don't lose it here there we go four kill trip very very nice so let's see what we get a torso seat not bad at all we have easily enough to get ourselves some gothic's dehyde boots that are 580k right now let's try and get them for 600. wow everything's super expensive i don't know what's happened to the market let's try and get the ancients instead then it's 13. there we go very nice oh we got them for 583 that is going to give us some very nice bonuses there and extra prayer which is huge compared to the snake skins which are horrendous and the next upgrade we're going to go for is definitely this carol's top so we're getting to the point where i'm literally having to leave because i don't have inventory space that is how good this setup is it's just as good as a top top set up in terms of being able to survive obviously kills are a bit slower and that was a 243 but we did get a one if we go here 148 to kill before so you know they're not exactly slow bad kills um and yeah it's getting to the point where i just have to leave and drop manta rays because of how much food we have left over like this is getting ridiculous i've just got so much food it's so unnecessary i really do not need to bring that to raise but uh it just shows how much this setup can do and how good it really is i think this is gonna be enough for us to get the carols top i forgot my uh anti-venom on this trip or well i didn't have enough for all three of the kills yeah three um so yeah we are a little bit venomous right now but it doesn't really matter let's go and see if we're gonna be able to afford this carol's top oh we easily can this is going to be insane we're going to look so so good 1.5 mil really why is everything so expensive today it's insanely expensive let's go to that then boom we've got a little bit of our money back to be fair let's sell this off and here we go chuck that bad boy on we are looking amazing so let's do a little price check and see how much we made total so uh we'll check the pots in and the gp in and stuff like that okay so about 416k in stuff that really isn't too expensive 488 500k uh let's drop that in takes us to 512. that takes us to 1.1 mil takes us to 1.3 mil the leather top coming in for 2.7 4.2 mil and that is probably actually we got these as well i guess let's put these in four 4.249 nil from like three hours starting from absolutely nothing remember we were pick pocketing guards at the start of these three hours that is absolutely sick didn't get a vocab head which meant we could have upgraded our accumulator which would have been really really nice and to be honest from here the big upgrades are things that cost quite a bit um so it would just be a case of grinding for a few more hours to get yourself the armadillo uh the dragonfire shields exact etc etc so yeah very very cool i think this is great should you do it 100 guys 100 if you can afford this bad boy and you've got dragon slayer done or dragon slayer 2 go ahead and do it guys thank you so much for watching don't forget to like comment and subscribe if you haven't already and i'll catch you in the next one
