[Music] so here we are right where we left off now i'm sure you all know what's about to happen i mean you did watch the first part of the story right [Music] [Music] i need something [Music] now this story is some long overdue revenge awesome oil rig running roof camping 12 plus man roman offline i'm sorry double offline raiden sack of shits let me introduce you to the koreans but before we get too far into it let's explain to the new viewers who didn't watch the first part of the story where this all began [Music] it was a sunny thursday morning for swipe no bps no bases there were four main characters to this story frost sergeant major deal brando and poison picker but to start it was only brando and i we had plans to build in the center of the map initially but you all know how that goes plans change after securing this insane spot we went to go get some scrap and check out the map and it was during this that we found out about our enemies [Music] introduce 12 plus man group also known as the koreans and they had their top four just like we had ours gonza within an hour of force wipe they had an ak which they made sure to use to their advantage we spent the whole first day fighting between our two bases and we actually made quite the profit but we also made quite the enemy are we late to you okay the first night on the server four swipe keep in mind we were offline rated through 12 garage doors they took everything but that didn't stop us we rebuilt the second day and fortified our base to brand new the only bummer is overnight the koreans quadrupled the size of their base with their base being that big you think we would have ran into them roaming but all they did was run oil in a roof camp they only took one fight right outside their base and when we did fight them that one time i clobbered them [Music] but they continued to send reinforcements after reinforcements after being defeated we looked for another way to get at them they had numbers and fights their base was way too fortified to get into and the only place we could catch them was on their way to or from oil rig so we built two towers on their path to oil rig one to shoot at them from and the other with a sam site we rigged the sam site up to a switch and whenever they flew back from oil to their base we'd blow them out of the sky but sadly they never came at least that night they didn't so we finally decided to go to bed and get just a little bit of rest now by this time it was 4 45 in the morning saturday morning i had just got off and i was laying in bed playing on my mobile device one of the and actually go to bed but then i heard it footsteps through my headphones even worse the sound of c4 [Music] we are getting raided right now so you can't grab a garage door with a i need a hammer i saw the [ __ ] light oh my i wish i even got to put up that much of a fight but that was only something i could have dreamed of so what really happened that night we did get raided by the koreans but i didn't log on i slept through it all of it and this time they made sure to grief everything and leave no chance for us to come back i logged on a few hours later with sergeant and our base had already decayed so much meaning that they raided us right after i got off it's like they were waiting so it is the same group why would they rape to the other side i guess just to [ __ ] i got into the [Music] back [Music] somebody else was in here this twig wasn't here earlier yeah someone's in there right now they just placed like something just terry there's a dead guy he's right here two guys monkey balls and pluto oh hey man hey we got raided man what's up yeah we're just exploring this [ __ ] yeah we're just kind of vibing here [Music] already our base had been taken over by some rats but we still had a few cards up our sleeves our small sam site base that we built yesterday was surprisingly unrated and it was still completely loaded with missiles it also had everything we needed to start building our base back as we farmed though we started to realize what was even the point anymore i mean their base had only gotten even bigger and now we were set back even farther but regardless of that for some reason we continued to play and continued to farm we got tc from our main cave base again and we took the garage doors and ladder hatches off and started to fortify not a single thing in there we packed up everything and we officially moved out from the cave base finally oh and one more thing we still had our tier three [Music] let's go after that poison of brando got on and we all contributed to farming up for the new base and poison and brando also went out to oil rig to go take it and during that time they actually managed to get us an ak don't ask me how i'm just as surprised as you are they had to spend an hour and a half fishing it out from the bottom of the sea but they did actually get it and they brought it back to base for us to research and with all the supplies we gathered we could craft one so that's what we did after being offline rated twice we really didn't care what we lost at this point we were just trying to make some sort of magical play i mean we had to bring the fight to the koreans anyway they weren't leaving their base oh wait wait wait wait turn on the thing wait wait [ __ ] i killed myself i killed myself go on should we if they come back and just do it now no it's on to turn it on wait did they come close enough we just miss the koreans with our sam site but when they go to oil they come back from oil damn okay they just went and did it we need a wood though a lot of wood i'm gonna go get a hatch off so i think we needed like 6k so we'll all need to farm some the same plan as last time but this time we had a sam site to close the get out uh hold me here's the deal is i think that one of you should go down there and be by her base because if that thing goes down they might have bags like in that area already all right do it oh one of you should go down there and just be like at our base area scared by all the things kind of how long is i think 15 [ __ ] minutes yep pretty sure night's 15 minutes so they by the time it becomes the morning then they should be coming back as the night progressed the crate was never taken chinook wasn't even cold we should see the crate disappear yep any second now another heli behind us south what if they died they're coming over all the way though crouch here two look hazmat [Music] no it's just one is it naked that is just one yeah flying back we assumed we had just been seen but we still didn't want to give away our position shooting at a naked in a mini copter oh just it just disappeared yeah it's gone [Music] oh here they come here they come they're coming right toward it i see it i see it they're coming right low too this is perfect one's higher one's higher i'm behind it i'm gonna go down because we're not gonna be able to do anything [Applause] [Music] there he goes shooting good shots getting shot hit him hit him yeah the one's going over he's gonna shoot that one too they saved it bro they all survived he just [ __ ] got hit four times and he didn't die what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] bro what just happened we just spent 750 scrap and all that time setting up a trap that didn't even blow up the heli let alone kill the guy flying it something was up he should have died man just took four sam site rockets and didn't die dude what all righty then well that's very very uh cool that was totally worth the scrap and all the time we put into a campsite trap that was so stupid so how did he survive for direct samsi missiles i was genuinely curious we all ran to the airfield tower that overlooked their base and we just sat there and stared in awe and disbelief as to what just happened and how all of our hard work was just for nothing it didn't make sense i didn't see anything moving down there but as i studied the base i realized what i had overlooked what i thought was a hemp base to form scrap all along wasn't just a hemp base there was something else brewing inside that building and i'm going to go ahead and say it's the reason they survived all those sam site rockets there it is a whole shitload of berry bushes why exactly well let me explain it to you when you're a 12-man korean zerg that almost gets bested by one guy on the coast and you have to bring 10 guys of reinforcements you also want to make sure that that doesn't happen again for you or your team so you want to boost up your health a little bit you take three of these red berry bushes and one yellow berry and you can combine them to make a basic max health tea you take four of those max health teas and you combine those to make one advanced max health tea you take four of those max health teas and you combine them again to make you one pure max health tea that lasts you 20 minutes of 120 health versus the average 100 health i would assume that they take these every single time before they probably take oil considering that's all they do meaning on his return home he was boosted out of his [ __ ] mind [Music] so uh yeah that was enough for me for the day as a matter of fact that was enough for me for the wipe i gave up on the koreans like i actually just wanted to get off because we tried and you can't say we didn't as a matter of fact we tried a [ __ ] ton and we just got stomped into the ground by their numbers and their offline rating over and over and over i wasn't even disappointed i just realized that this wasn't a group that i could possibly get a story out of because their methods were just beyond that so that was the end of the story that was the video that i was going to put out for you guys like 100 honest truth i gone on two days later and i was gonna get the server seed so i could start recording cinematics and show you guys how tough of a wipe we had but it was when i logged back on two days later that something in chat sparked my interest and i decided to do something that i had never done before because i mean the fire for revenge against these koreans was still burning inside of me so let's fast forward a few days to the moment i rejoined the server to check on their base and get the server seat upon my return to the server the population had been cut in half over the past two days what used to be a 200 plus pop server was now around 85 to 110 players and when i checked the map it seemed that the koreans were still functioning korea number one easy server flexing 30 aks huh interesting well i guess they're right easy server now here's where the chat dialogue gets a little bit interesting gonzo is actually typing in chat the guys who raided us these koreans but that wasn't what caught my attention what caught my attention was this message ddb the y12 guys are just big [ __ ] talkers lmao they can't online worth [ __ ] you got that right the y12 guys were the koreans and it seemed like we weren't the only ones they had been offlining throughout the white [Applause] this ddb group then agreed with them saying i know they have offlined every person on the server they are killing the pop and then after that gongs are then typed so ddb come raid question mark and that was it that's when i realized that this ddb group could be the numbers that we needed i mean we were two groups with a common enemy so why not try to come together and take them out with everything and anything that we can muster up i mean it was a long shot but i figured i'd give it a shot so without hesitation i reached out to weskie typing in chat and he responded quickly i was just going to tell him straight up what my intentions were and there was no going to be hiding my identity as frost either because we are going to be talking in discord if this was to go through and i didn't want to waste any time this story wasn't about an unlikely ally it was about revenge and he was nice enough to give me his discord right away so i reached out to him i explained to him quickly the encounters and experiences we had with the koreans the swipe and that i would be willing to offer myself and my group as extras and to help with any farming needed if he wanted to group up and possibly try to online rate them now i'll be honest it took him a minute to answer and i think it's because he had to make sure it was the real frost and not someone who was about to scam him from all of his rockets but when he decided he was down and apparently he already had quite the arsenal and he was willing to use it all on these koreans and just like that it seemed like this story wasn't over just yet [Music] now let me take you far away to land undiscovered by us and the koreans into the southwest corner of the map uh is is your guys's name again based in a f-21 here is this my back yes yes yeah yeah all right i'm spawning again are you in a team already yeah there's traps everywhere oh yeah wait under it was when they took me down to their main loot room that i realized this hit on the koreans might actually be possible yeah you like that vending machine where which one left of the tc oh yeah that's i mean i don't know how many it will take to go through there but that's a [ __ ] oh yeah this dbb group was [ __ ] loaded so we started to prep for the rain over the next few hours i made sure to do my part and try to contribute as much as i can considering how much these guys were putting on the line i'm gonna buy scrappy damon you're gonna take it home with whoever needs to and then one person can fly back with me in the mini since the koreans were on the complete opposite side of the map we needed a scrap pelley for transportation after that we decided to do a run to launch site and see if we can rack up any more c4 a possible m2 or rockets not much luck at bradley but we did get something we wanted c4 c4 nice after that we farmed up just a little bit more sulfur so we could craft a few more rockets and then we headed home and we started to plan for the big raid we needed to assemble a team a big team we all sat down to plan the raid i would contribute a strong team of six guys and they would bring eleven we took the time to draw out a professional layout of their base we also sent some coyotes to go scout out the turret layout in their compound [Music] not to mention it was the first foggy day on the server since wipe we would use this to our advantage when setting up our raid base everyone finally logged on we had all geared up and without further ado it was finally time someone's bringing boxes on this first run right yeah i got boxes i got boxes on me i got the hammer what do you need make sure you guys stay close close to each other hug each other so we can don't get through who's building raid base right off the bat i'm building are you building this and someone else are we good on fuel on here how much fuel do we have we have a lot okay good we were part of the first raid group to head over to y12 we would wait for everyone else behind our old raided rock base all right everyone out everyone out go go go go go go it was kind of amazing to me to see a group who we had just met come together and form such a massive coordinated plan with us we waited behind that rock until team two showed up and when they did boy did we have a lot of people oh my everyone plays bags dude how are they all right jesus all right let's go boys all right are you ready just get that base down hey hey landing hey he's landing don't get squished don't switch all right all right uh we're gonna put bass down uh like bottom right x11 okay all right all right let's move let's move people right yeah it was eerily quiet around the koreans compound but i'd say it was the fog that caused that because this was no different than any other regular day for the koreans they were online we just hadn't spotted them yet the only thing was they had already spotted us right here you got this you got rocks there was no point for us to fight from the rocks far away from their base we had to push down to the compound we waited behind some cover and baited some rockets while the rest of our team set up the raid base then when we're done we headed down their tc's third floor by the way so aim high [Music] yeah we're ready to go last time all right come to the second floor we need to all get outside right now all right yeah let's go right now there was only three defending on the roof if we took them out we'd have a small opening of time to push down there's no one down he's down he said he's pushing down i'm pushing right really good smoke right here we found the weak spot on their base that would give us access to one of their tc's so we let them have it watch out keep going break the ttm no no [Music] dude i wasted a rocket i'm so bad all right once we smoked out their shooting floor we just let our rocket guys hit him with everything watching these koreans get pummeled was the best thing i had seen all night [Music] three times here's the line of i made a small effort to check the loot bag to see what they had but luke wasn't what i was there for i was there for names [Music] take the meds back to the base there's a boxing mess there i was right by the way about the whole berry farm thing you know what was in their boxes this raid carried on all the way into the night and then all the way back into the morning you're running back above you have one shot then [Applause] [Music] and whenever i got the chance to catch one of them alive i made sure they knew who was raiding them [Music] we made sure to pick everybody clean leaving them absolutely nothing then i headed back to base to see the loot it was beyond any amount of loot i had ever seen come from a raid i mean it was the items of multiple bases offline rated to these koreans it was such a perfect ending to this story we didn't even need any of the loot we were getting off after that but this is what they deserved and it's what needed to happen considering i hadn't even had this planned until earlier today and even made it so much better they actually continued to talk [ __ ] and chat after that saying how we offline them and whatnot but the ultimate [ __ ] talk that could have happened during that rain was this let's see if we're rated now yo look look what i put in the vending machine i did no i did look what i it from flexing 30 aks in their vending machine to having one rock the raid couldn't have gone any better this is like a cml cml clan whatever yeah it's like the cmo yeah this is gross all right say cheese [Music] picture [Music] your own life [Music] without any thought i keep moving on i don't even care if my soul is gone
