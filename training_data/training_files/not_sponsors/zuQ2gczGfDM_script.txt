this right here believe it or not is the fastest single GPU gaming laptop that we have ever had in our office the zephyrus GX 701 is an absolute beast rocking a six core core i7 processor and a geforce r-tx 28 Emacs q that's clocked closer to a desktop spec than the laptop one but how the heck have they managed to cram all of that power in here and has the extra performance been worth the interesting design choices that you know like the keyboard placement wait wait where's the webcam it's not here it's not here is it under here oh no that's [Music] the Zephyrus GX 701 does an excellent job of looking both classy and gay Murray at the same time blending eye catching details like the colorful ROG logos and RGB keyboard with a very sturdy black magnesium alloy chassis that gives the device a distinctly premium feel now the zephyrus does look a bit like an oddball but at this point we've pretty much come to expect its small offset vertical trackpad it's shifted keyboard and the ventilation flat party trick that opens up the back of the chassis for improved airflow speaking of party tricks in the Box you get a little metal sculpture of the ROG logo which is cool I guess but honestly ASIS I would have much rather there was a Gigabit Ethernet dongle in here it's the only port that's really notably missing from what's otherwise a very solid assortment of i/o with USB C with charging and full-sized HDMI all making appearances now let's get into performance as we discussed in our review of the msi gs70 5 invidious mobile r-tx cards can have extremely varied thermal and power targets with about half of their performance depending on laptop manufacturers ability to completely optimize both cooling and power delivery so with that in mind before we proceed with our testing we need to disable the illuminated logo right here above the keyboard because according to a soos it's possible to see a three degree increase in temperatures while it's on and when push comes to shove it turns out that we are not actually willing to give up real performance for RGB lighting and we don't have to in the 3d mark portroyal test our GX 701 s graphics core managed 1600 megahertz for the duration of the test time which is shockingly close to desktop performance and side note absolutely smashes the msi gs70 5 translates into real-world performance that just run circles around last end laptops enabling high refresh rate gaming and triple-a titles that previously would have run closer to 60 FPS than they would to 144 now we haven't got any other max-q laptops in yet so we don't know if others on the market will be equally fast but we do know that they won't be faster for that you would need something truly massive like the ROG mothership or the Alienware area 51 M and there's more good news the FPS isn't the only thing that's been turned up here so has the screen size with a 17 inch thin bezel display sitting where a 15.6 inch one used to be but this did come with a sacrifice not only is there no webcam up here there isn't one anywhere else on the machine blasphemy now asus solution was to pack a 1080p 60fps webcam in the box with the logic being that well we have to choose between one of two options including a barely usable webcam like what i'ma sided with the GS 75 stealth or include one that doesn't fit in the laptops chassis but is frankly good enough for twitch streaming well okay fair point but here's my take why are you guys acting like there are only two ways of doing something why is it my job to come up with something else here's an idea free of charge you make an indent here and you put a camera bump there the smartphone industry has been doing it for years and then we could have even better front-facing cameras or I mean while we're thinking outside of the box instead of this going on like this how about magnets there is no reason that they couldn't have run a USB 2 interface up here had little contact points that power it and handle data and you just put it on there and it snaps into place now in fairness as it is the quality is great the best that we've seen on a gaming laptop but the implementation is truly clunky back to the display though this thing it's very impressive it's a 144 Hertz IPs 1080p panel with g-sync 3 millisecond response times and factory calibration from Pantone frankly it's awesome to game on and it's got other benefits to a soos astutely noticed that a lot of people purchase gaming computers like this for professional tasks like cad music creation and video editing so they actually tuned the display to be more suitable for these tasks and it's great because video editing on laptops used to be a giant bag of suck nowadays honestly for basic cutting you can't tell the difference and even for some light after effects work they are pretty darn capable of course for more professional or creative work CPU power is key which is why desktops still have a lot of life in them by the way I mean any system with the core i7 8700 K will destroy the Zephyrus for a lot less money but Asus has done quite a bit to make the core i7 8750 H in here more potent it's 1200 score and Cinebench is higher than most core i9 laptops that we've tested and under an all core synthetic load the CPU gets toasty while it's turbo Eng Ben settles down to a more reasonable level at around 3 gigahertz sustained that's not bad the only way to get more performance out of a laptop would be to buy something much thicker which is kind of becoming a recurring theme here and along with its strong CPU performance the GX 701 can be equipped with up to 24 gigs of RAM 8 gigs soldered while the remaining 16 is on a sodium slot and a one terabyte nvme SSD from Samsung that really impressed us like this machine regularly loaded games and completed tasks faster than the two rate zeroed SSDs in the GS 75 but performance only gets you so far let's return to the questionable keyboard and trackpad placement I'm actually gonna let Alex who did up the review on this field this bit over the last two years here I've used a ton of laptops and I have to say this design choice of putting the key word rig here is not nearly as bad as you think like you doesn't get on your lap is a really bad time and so is going from one side of the screen to the other with this trackpad but beyond that I'm always surprised by how quickly using the trackpad on the right of the laptop becomes natural to me after a day of using the zephyrus I suspect you'll be reaching for the numpad on other laptops instead of the usual trackpad placement the only real improvement I would have made is to bring back the front fire and speakers from the last efforts and use this space to make the trackpad even wider but Linus and I ended up just debating of whether we'd end up giving up the surprisingly good sound quality asus has been able to squeeze in here one thing we agree on for sure though is the quality of the keyboard it's got a bit of an unusual feel but the strokes while short have a nice tactile feel and the keycap stabilization is well above average making it pretty forgiving for inaccurate typists it's solid and Asus was actually particularly proud of their volume knob which really does have quite a nice feel and satisfying click for mute ok alright so that's all fine and good but the biggest problem with the Zephyrus has always been its portability its small yes light ish but the last model had a Wimpy fifty-three watt hour battery that struggled to get three hours of light to moderate use in our testing to address this shortcoming asus has finally up to the battery capacity to 76 watt hours now to get the most out of it you're gonna have to make some tweaks you're gonna want to switch out of dedicated GPU mode which means disabling g-sync and allowing the Intel I GPU to takeover for later tasks and of course you're gonna have to dial back your RGB and not the screen refresh rate down to 60 Hertz but if you do all these things it adds up to letting this guy run for about five hours on battery with light to moderate use not too shabby and the type-c USB charging also helps in this regard because it allows you to pack a much smaller 65 watt charger if you don't plan on gaming saving you a pound or two and you backpack so as long as you have a desk wherever you're planning on working the Sepphoris is now a much more compelling option than ever before ask for upgradability well no one's perfect opening it up and replacing the RAM or storage is possible but there's only one RAM and one m2 slot making upgrades more wasteful and therefore expensive which in turn makes it harder for us to recommend these specs down versions of this guy if there's any chance that you might need to upgrade them later which I guess brings us to the conclusion for our model here coming in and an eye-watering 3300 u.s. dollars it's expensive so if you want something cheaper the msi gs70 5 is a solid option and the Zephyrus jacks 531 still gets you the same CPU for about $1,300 less but the GX 701 still walks out of here with a solid recommendation thanks to a Seuss's zero compromise approach to cooling battery life and build quality with extra marks for the Pantone calibrated display did you ever wonder link in the video description so thanks
