[Music] hey what's up Sears here now today we're gonna be covering a few different items and spells that have some weird mechanics hidden within either intentionally or not but the majority of OS RS players do not know about these so it should be a pretty interesting video some of these items are useful or funny others strange and unique but a few have actually been used by a certain group of naughty players through bug abuses and lures so let's get into it but first I good luck and I will see you there now first off the lunar spell book is known for its weird quirky and not very useful spells like dream baked pie and the hunter kit there's also another spell that many players skip over and they'll never click on it in their entire life but it is amazing and most players don't know the true potential the boost potion share if you actually use this spell on a potion it will distribute one potion dose per player in the surrounding area up to four players and doses the mechanic that makes this spell so good and what most people don't realize is the caster always gets a free dose of potion when using it on another player I personally use the potion share every single time I go bossing with multiple teammates you usually something like longer trips at God Wars dungeon for example if you're too willing Bandos with your buddy you effectively get double the amount of super restores and super combat potions but you cannot use a spell on saradomin brews next mechanic dropping a staff every single item in the game that's on the ground has a click box you know the area of the game tile where you're able to click on an item what most players don't know is that an items click box can be changed and manipulated as you can see here when I drop a feather on the ground it goes underneath the seed because of its lower alcohol you what it also does is slightly extend the range of the seeds click box you're most likely thinking this is interesting but how could it be useful in any way well have a look when I drop a staff on the ground now of course the staff is higher up value than the seed so it goes on top here's the comparison of the original seed click box and the click box of the staff we can see the area of the click box is actually double than what it originally was now the kicker to this is all the shady players that took advantage of this by combining it with a glitch and a lure what enough items are stacked on top of one another in the game on a game tile the items below it are pushed out of the screen what the staff does is extend the click box of the tiles so that the staff may be right clicked in order to see the items on the ground beneath all the clutter a handful of scammers and lowers abuse this a couple years ago by using a glitch to spawn unlimited URIs from a clue scroll to cover up another player's item they had dropped even if you had tele grab ruins you could still not get it making it impossible to retrieve them unless you had a staff with the release of prifddinas the new elf City quest came the crystal armor a set of armor that boosts the damage of the crystal bow what a majority players don't know is that it shares this same mechanic as a much older item the crystal shield your crystal armor and shield degrade every time you take damage by a monster or player but only if the number hit on you is above a zero unlike other degradable items such as Derek's any type of barrows if you have the correct prayer up against the monster your armor or shield will never go down in charges as the monster will hit a zero this may not sound that useful but it bosses like Hydra or nightmare zone even Slayer where I've done correctly you will never take any damage due to having prayer up the armor will never degrade all players in the game use food as means to restore their hit points what most players don't know is that certain foods also restore other things such as run energy or cure poison starting at the worse is the by which heels 8hp and 5% run energy many players used to obtain papayas back and earn scape with the fruit bat from summoning the bats main ability was to spawn fruit which players are used to heal I places I God Wars dungeon coming up next we have purple sweets which restore 10% run energy and 1 to 3 HP each you can actually get purple sweets as rewards from any type of clue scroll these are extremely expensive about 2.5 to 3.5 K each what's actually good about this item is you can have thousands of purple sweets in one space they are actually stackable the number one place in the game tax you use these purple sweets would be getting your fire cape with Chad we're actually getting the inferno cape and again you can have thousands in your inventory which is thousands of HP now this is one of my favorite food items of all time this summer pie now summer pies heal 11 HP per slice so that's 22 total to more than a shark they're normally about a hundred GP less than a shark and they also restore 10% run energy and booster duty by 5 per summer pies are amazing as all K know when you need to you know run and heal yourself maybe something like saradomin cod wars if you're soloing running around the room another good spot for these summer pies will be doing the underground past quests you need to be running a lot while you're taking damage as well now the last consumable would be the gothic restore gothics restore is a tea that is made from combining two Guam's a har lander and a marital into a teacup after the recipe is learned after the one small favor quest the cool thing about the gothic restore is it's actually a tea but it acts as like a potion so you can be drinking it you know multiple times while staying in combat you won't be interrupted it's amazing for like corporal beast FFA maybe even training Slayer or PK it's amazing for PK gothic first or actually heals 5 HP per dose there's four doses per potion T so that's 20 HP another cool thing about this as well it can actually heal 5 HP over your max HP just like an anglerfish would so if you're 99 HP you sip this you're gonna go to 104 it also restores 5% run energy parsnip and it turns venom into poison and lowers poison damage by one per dose so if you're getting hit a four by poison you take a sip of one of these it'll go to three might as well mention this because we're on the topic Sam few serums as well they're about 22 K each but they act as a super restorer and an ant plus plus so every sip as you know prayer potion plus you get 12 minutes of immunity percept coming up next the charged amulet of glory I'm sure every single person watching this video knows aside them it is the best cheapest amulet in the entire game they're about 12 K each right now and they come with some amazing teleports as well a pretty useful added effect to the amulet of glory as long as you have one charge equipted while mining any regular or or a mother lode mine you have an increased chance of finding gems the base chance to mine any gem is 1 out of 256 but with the Amy of glory equipted it turns to one out of 86 what makes the glory a deal breaker is when you're actually mining gem rocks and Shiloh village having a charged glory will greatly increase your success of mining a gem Rock I did a quick test and with a charged amulet of glory I mined a full inventory gems in about a minute and 45 seconds without the glory in the same exact path it took me 3 minutes and 50 seconds alright this one is pretty dangerous pretty epic and I'm sure many of you guys do not know about it there was a scam slash lore method and Deadman mode where players used to use a T Flash installed animation of them running and pull opponents into a safe zone this animation stalled Plus casting vengeance have both recently been removed within the last few months due to players abusing it many scammers combine that stall with other items to create an animation stalling bug where your character looks like it's standing in one place but in reality it's actually standing in another bug abusers would use this to Lord players outside of the safe zone in PvP worlds normally having them trade another player that looked like they were standing in the bank but in reality they were standing far away and stalling you know they're moved character to go outside the bank and have them trade and then there would be a PK squad waiting outside within the last few weeks another item has been found that performs the exact same way as the T flask and the vengeance spell the calc wot keg many players and bug abusers are starting to do this new scam with the calc walk egg I'm actually now going to show it just because I don't want to I don't want to get caught or you banned you know anything like that but if you do want to you know at jagex on twitter and let them know about this video that'd be cool next up a very interesting one of the pearl bolts the enchanted pearl bolts have an effect called the seekers where players call forth a wave of water on their opponent this causes a one-twentieth of the players boosted range level extra damage the unique mechanic of these bolts is that the effect can be boosted or completely negated whether the opponent is a fiery creature or if the player is wielding a staff of water or fire if the opponent is a fiery creature or a player wearing a fire staff the effect is increased to 1 out of 15 of the players boosted range level but if the opponent is wielding a water staff the effect will be completely negated and never actually proc this is a perfect example of why I made this video there's so many hidden items hidden mechanics a little lower behind the game I mean I never even knew this existed and I've been playing for like 14 years alright the last one for you guys something small and fun of course the abyssal whip is one of the best slash weapons in OSR is amazing for training defense and attack one thing about 98% of the players do not know I guarantee you guys do not know this one it can actually be used to cut fruit and but not all the fruit just a banana when most people think of a whip they picture a bullwhip like the one in Indiana Jones but after digging around a research on a Bissel whip was most likely modeled after the Chinese chain whip [Music] as you can see from the video I found that Chinese whip can easily cut through the watermelon and honestly they should have done that instead of a banana because a watermelon actually heals 15hp if your HP level is above 80 so that would be you know another good food item to use almost on par with the monkfish this was definitely a video that was different from my normal uploads I do hope you guys enjoyed the longer I kept digging the more interesting it got with all the hand mechanics and whatnot and you know feel free to throw a thumbs up on the video if you did enjoy this different type of video but yeah guys check out the shadow um you know legends link down below if you guys are curious I will actually be going to Vegas for the next one week so I will see you guys then and I have a lot of videos to post although you guys have a great day peace out
