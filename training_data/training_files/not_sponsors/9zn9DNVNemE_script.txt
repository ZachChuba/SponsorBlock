you know what I've always hated ghosts whether they were those little freaks and pac-man who gave me crazy anxiety evil spirits that do really inconvenient things like move your keys or tilt your picture frames or this guy boom you don't get to call me that until you commit no I hate them even more because I got ghosted for the first time and Wow it really hurt and was scary so I really like getting to know you we just like to hang out on Thursday what does that mean you're a ghost you're not invisible Nick it's fine if you don't want to hang out with me but just respond just answer me just tell me but what was even worse was when I told my friends about it I just didn't see this coming like at all Wow didn't you say that he consistently flaked out initially when you guys were trying to connect yeah but that was coffee and we didn't really know each other that and didn't you say that he'd never follow through on anything he said he was gonna do but he was busy and he apologized for that and didn't you say that he said that he didn't think marriage would work out except for with penguins okay but that's different okay you don't give someone a pebble unless you're serious but of course you can't really blame those of us who act like total idiots when we like someone because fun fact just found this out when people begin falling in love your frontal cortex which is vital to judgment shuts down isn't that insane your brain literally deactivates the part of itself that can criticize and judge because it knows if you can maintain your critical thinking you probably won't put up with as much  and then you won't reproduce to ensure the survival of your species so what do we do what do we do when our brains literally shut down our ability to think clearly it's very simple but very hard sit back and observe their patterns people show you who they are all the time listen to them they're always giving you information so my cat is a Capricorn son a cancer moon and a Pisces ascendant so like obviously Wow mm-hmm what's your point what's your site I'm a Capricorn oh you're a Capricorn - oh you're just like my kitty and even if it's someone you're not romantically attracted to even if you're just wondering whether or not you should stay friends with someone or go into business with a colleague wait and see what their patterns are don't judge them on what they say I know I'm a ghost but I will always be transparent with you don't judge them on their actions [Music] trust their patterns to tell you exactly who they are the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior so keep your hopes and expectations low go slow and take note of the values in the person that you're watching and do those values line up with what you want and a potential friend partner or colleague everyone tend to leave all in before I even really know a person and let me tell you it has not served me and it's caused me a lot of heartbreak pain frustration and disappointment I'm Anna Akana stay right here for an animated Squarespace add by Bethany Ratliff and if you're interested in seeing how she actually creates the graphics on these videos be sure to check out her twitch stream where she shows you the process
