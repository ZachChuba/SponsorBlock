we are reacting to kpop once again the group is dreamcatcher and the song is endless night this one was pretty heavily requested so I'm pretty excited to get to it because it's supposed to be a metal song essentially but we'll see what that means to metal head like me the last song my dreamcatcher that we reacted to was called good night and that one was heavy but it had a bit more of a j-rock vibe and not so much of a metal vibe also the title of that one was a bit more positive sounding than this even though they're similar titles they're both about Knights but this one has just a bit more metal of a vibe already and this night let's get it oh my gosh [Music] it's really groovy his groove metal love that pinch our morning oh my god the dancing my bass tone is massive oh my gosh no that's a distorted bass tones love the vocal melody - wait this sounds like Japanese yeah I think it is evidence which rooms oh my god those are definitely metal drums [Music] and he's that cheer-off type chorus you gotta have a catchy chorus going to speak heavy all the way through [Music] I know [Music] there's that cool riff again down-home I love that this is more just like a dance video I think there's those drum rolls again the snare rolls the vessels [Music] nice uplifting course as the course should be well that tapping in the background I don't think that was there the guitars have been to your last course [Music] and this isn't heavy heavy metal but Stephanie model [Music] this gives me like a classic yellow rag [Music] another cool cord they always use out of out of keywords in the bridge I've noticed that a synth is that didn't sound like a live before we love that beat are in the background [Music] nice dancing [Music] of that blue scale rift really doozy oh man that double kick I don't think goodnight had that and that's it well endless night it's undoubtedly heavier than goodnight it's got that ominous verse section with there's no guitar in space and that's really metal and the main riff is also really metal but that's contrasted by the uplifting chorus and I just think that's a great dichotomy in the song I think this is about as heavy as the kpop metal song can get while still sounding like kpop and just slightly bringing in those elements of metal like the double kick the snare rolls the blue scale riffs I'd also say the song has the coolest vocal melodies of any dreamcatcher song I've heard it just has a lot of melodic movement and I'm all about that yeah I just love this group when we covering them really soon so stick around for know what you want me to react to next I really appreciate all your recommendations this one was definitely heavily requested so I'm happy to have gone to it and yeah so
