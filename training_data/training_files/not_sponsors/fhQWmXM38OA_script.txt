it's been so long who am i who are you people why are we here what series is this I forgotten I forgotten who I am and my purpose I have forgotten how to laugh why does it take me so long to record videos of this I don't know I like recording them everybody likes watching them but for some reason it's been months since the last one the world makes no sense anymore but I am back baby back ready to laugh hard or never in fact since last time we now have laugh merch and sorry we now have I'm doing it okay oh baby think we could all do with a little bit of a WoW today we're looking at something that is has the potential to be hilarious I know it's the whole point of the series I'd be very bad youtuber and terrible at my job if we didn't find stuff that was actually funny but we are looking at training videos or corporate sort of training videos where they go over stuff I don't really know what to call them this one is about Wendy's training video hot drinks I have no idea what this is I have never seen any company training videos and I don't know how they end up on YouTube but I'm very excited [Music] [Applause] and oh my gosh these hole in time and stony made sense um oh you can stay there before it's too strong [Music] is this an entire song to train people who work at Wendy's how to pour the coffee and the hot drinks I love it coffee which is the light every time [Music] god damn mrs. fire I want to do this for everything in my life now waking up putting on all my clothes go to the kitchen get my drink for the coffee up to the line open fridge then we look for snack bring your lies I ate everything last night thank you thank you very much I worked very hard in it and my brain is steaming I just loved it they they put it in song format and rhymed everything to just make it a like a lot more digestible but they're just saying everything in song format imagine if that was your entire life going to take a break and drink some water put it down and put the lid back on top on pause the video because this joke is old I'm gonna move on [Music] why does it look like a horror movie from the 90s this guy's name is hot drink Harry he comes to your room at night and pour scalding water on your face to drain your soul from your body and he does it all while singing pull out my knife and stab you right in the throat next one comes from McDonald's this is 200,000 views McDonald's custodial training video this training aid is for the exclusive use by licensees of McDonald's core so if you go to McDonald's you actually have watch this before you can do

what is happening you called him an [ __ ] a second ago and that's now there's two voices happening is this not a real video I'm smelling some iqbal [ __ ] around here what sanic see as McDonald's language we call the custodian the Moxxi because well there's clean and then there's Mick what does that mean you wouldn't know your big dumb stinky head its McDonald's language get the [ __ ] out of here it's your job to make sure that this McDonald's restaurant is the cleanest place in town Wow guys don't forget this to mix smash that like button that make like button step 1 take your brush and dip it in the bucket and brush the solution on sorry Chris you wouldn't get our McDonald's language it's very tricky you dip the brush in the bucket and then you put it on the window I know it's very tricky for a mixie to understand and don't stop cleaning until you see Moxxi well who's talking in the background it's like this version of this video has the actual video and then a crowd reacting to it and now I'm reacting to the crowd's reaction to this I don't know I can handle off that window bumped our window Chris I haven't seen Moxxi yet buff that window they say if you're really good you'll see mixi I don't know what that means sorry I know I'm pausing it a lot there's a lot to take in just watch the damn video Shawn I know you're yelling at me I spent a long time since I recorded one of these call me some slack all I have is a bell and a banana the details you've got to finesse the details if you're going to see maxi Jennifer have you ever seen Lexi oh sure he's around here somewhere come on we've got a Florida mock-up isn't he Moxxi why am I not following this at all she said you're the pneumix see the mick custodian McClean oh wait no is an actual person gonna show up at the end called Moxxi I'm so invested whoa hold on there Chris I'm glad to see you're so enthusiastic but you're defeating your purpose a little bit okay you're sweeping too fast yeah you're right hey that was quite a workout what we're just gonna move on grace you're sweeping too fast buff that window you're never gonna see mixi like this goddamn it Chris you're such a dick [ __ ] boy McDonald's doesn't do anything halfway do that hey-oh I mean we don't do anything halfway . oh my god this feels like a cult if you work at mcdonald's you're joining a cult maybe that's what the see and mixi stands for mccolts [Music] also this face is horrifying yeah it looks pretty good what about a baseball Chris did you to detail the job job what can you do different uh say Jennifer do you think maybe I should wipe down the baseboards make it shine guy make it shine the hell I even shine the pipes Jennifer no that's detailing it did you get the mirror I got the mirror did you buff that mirror to see Moxxi Tomic see wait he saw mix 'yes he sums if you see Moxxi does that mean that something is done really well so you've seen mix see it's like seeing the eyes of God but Donald's God is Moxxi god I hope Jennifer doesn't catch me out here she's gonna start talking about Moxxi again that's what anyone says at their friends when they show them my videos it's like Oh what are we gonna watch on the Internet today garbage also I've been to plenty of McDonald's in my life I have never seen one as clean as they are making it out to be in this video I mean maybe it's because a lot of the McDonald's around here are just it's the people who go into them are people who are shit-faced at the end of a Friday night and they just want a Big Mac and that's fine McDonough's you're you're just you're fine okay you don't need to you don't need to like deke up the place to make it look amazing I don't think people are going to go up to the windows and go wow now that's mixi say Jennifer what's up next garbage another one from Wendy's boys oh my god they really like their songs [Music] we just appreciate that all of these videos are supposed to be internal so it's supposed to be when you go to work there you get seen these videos so these are not supposed to be seen by the public but so much production value went into just that intro alone for that I appreciate that from the day I opened the first Wendy's my goal has been to serve the best hamburger in the business so I started with a freshest beef I could find his I'm burgers are the best in the business I will say that Wendy's is my favorite fast-food burger it tastes really dang good I am going to have a hot and juicy hamburger with mustard pickle and onion you have to wait in line at your own restaurant come on man you can just go in you were just in the back oh my god what what is it Wendy's meat he just got sucked into the TV with the meat and cheese that's ready to go ass ow keep your station looking cool but most of all you got to have your tools he's playing to to electric guitar guys when he's is the greatest food chain of all time not too little not too much oh [ __ ] this is like a whole bag of cocaine all over it maybe that's why their burgers are so good Wow guys amazing Wendy's I loved you already but please marry me that is really only you oh then where do I start what do I do he just told you the entire song Billy he sang it he put a hundred and ten percent effort into it he was waiting all day for you to come up only for you to hear him for three minutes to turn around be like what I do I've got a soft me from the back to the front and make the face complete not too little not too much with the little finesse hey oh my god he is a flavor in there hey get some sums as going on I like it this is great I love this chemistry I'm with you guys oh nice give it a little wobble hey God that looks good when you see red juices on the top of the meat it's time to give them a turn then press a repeat do it again just like you did it before through the four corner press just one time hell yeah Billy you said you didn't know where to start I don't know what to do hey you're a champion you're pro don't screw the grill we want to let you see it keep the meat moist it's hot you see we get a repeat on that line and keep the meat moist so if you see hey give me twice because it's hot you see it takes just about four minutes to occur but just to make sure you can take a look use your tool to a double check this would be great in Moy to be correct yeah yeah you guys got the wrap down you guys like oh you guys can go out there and perform now but you you gotta work on that handshake man okay lay down the cheese in a juicy spot but don't leave it too long or ill get too hot okay lay it up on to me do it right keep it nice drif dance I'm on the bun just so don't touch you with your fingers that's a big no-no no Billy no shush stop Billy press them together and it's completely drain a certain like you did before and you can handle any dudes who walk through the door why is it oh my god this is amazing I don't know what's happening the stage one I'm raw and you
