hey what is going on you guys it is mr no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today i bring you guys a pretty strange one this is going to be loot from 3 000 snails and the gear for this video was pretty old-fashioned uh you know snails are really low hp and most people can one or two hit them so i just went with a very basic setup but a nostalgic one full black d-hide with a magic short bow and some rune arrows with a robin hood hat and ranger boots and because snails are located in mortania the only items that i was bringing for this video was direct teleport runes to kaherol and this would be my way of banking so this would be right outside of the martania swamp and i would use cannafist bank to bank all of the snails and all the shells that i did get from this video you can also use the kahero teleport tabs but those are 9.5 k each and the runes are like 10 of that so much smarter to just use the runes and i'm sure you're wondering mr no sleep why would you ever want to kill snails you know what are these things good for other than being a nuisance when you're trying to do a quest in the swamp or trying to train your hunter level i mean there's a lot of different things that you can do in the swamp of mortania it's a very very big swamp there's multiple locations where you can find multiple different snails at and rather than just ignoring them like most people do i wanted to take the time and actually kill a decent amount of them see if we can make any money from them and you know maybe this can be a lower level money making method or maybe this is going to be a complete waste of time but we will find that out at the very end so with all that being said let's get into the history of snails on runescape i know all of you have wanted to know all about this since the day that you started playing well maybe not that much but anyway there's five different snails in this game first we have the meijer blemish snail this happens to be the lowest level this is level nine um all of the snails were released into the game on the same day october 14 and each of them can be either rounded or pointed and from every snail you can expect two things one being the shell and the other being the meat killing the blemish snails didn't result in much profit because their shell isn't used for anything although the meat being thin is at a current price of just shy of 500 gp so that's not too bad for such a low level monster and the next snail we have is the lighter yellow snail also known as the ochre blemish snail definitely double check that one this one is a combat level of 10 and also drops then snail meat and just like the meyer blemish snail uh the shell for this one is useless it's not really used for much at all and our third snail of the video would be the blood blemish snail now this snail is twice the level of the previous ones at level 20. and it can be assumed since this snail is a bigger level that the meat on this one is a little more thick which is why it's labeled the fat snail now fat snails are currently worth 1 000 gp each which is double the price of the thin snail and you may have also seen people in game through the years with a helmet called the blood and tar snelm now this is a helmet that you can wield and it will reduce the damage taken from the snails it's black with a nice red trim on top it's cool fashion scape you know if you're into snail helmets but certainly not the best stats uh it's negative three mage bonus it's negative one range bonus although the defense on it is plus seven for range and plus seven for melee so it's good for snails and if you are 15 crafting and you have a chisel then you can use this on the round blemish red shell and this will create this little snail helmet and moving on to our fourth snail this would be the bark blemish snail this one is the top dog as it goes for the price uh the lean snail meat that it drops every kill is at a current price of 1200 each according to the in-game chat now all these prices are of course estimates as we really don't know how much uh each shell and meat will sell for until the very end however the shell for the bark blemish this one is bright orange it's very hard to miss it's also the only snail without a pointed counterpart so no sharp orange shells will ever be found in the game uh these specific types of snails actually spit acid it doesn't poison you but yeah they do spit and finally we have our last snail the bruise blemish snail this one is combat 20 drops a fat snail uh the orange snail is the only one that drops the lean one and the blue and the black drop the fat one and the others drop the thin one it's easy to remember after you spend the four days here and a fun fact about this snail the bruise blemish one is that the snelm that you can create from the pointed shell is actually used for a medium clue scroll step i'm sure a lot of you actually knew that that makes this shell the most valuable out of all of them because it does actually have a use a lot of these snelms literally have no use at all in runescape i mean other than for low level fashion scape or low level pay-to-play pk i mean i guess you could use it as a defensive helmet if you're lowered the fence but you know you really don't see people using it in the wild now in regards to snail meet looking at the wiki in late february of 2002 blamish snail slime was introduced as a quest item in heroes quest now this helps create the oily fishing rod that is used to catch lava eels and i would assume that this means that snails were introduced on this same day however the wiki shows that snails were released into the game two years later so i don't know the details on that but i found that was worth mentioning it's also worth mentioning that cooking a thin snail is uh actually an easy task for the mortania diary so a lot of you may have done this in the past you just don't remember it now as it goes for killing the snails i was averaging about 200 kills an hour with the magic short bow and at one point i decided to try using a cannon here you know focus on picking up all the snails rather than manually killing them all this resulted in 420 kills an hour but unfortunately runelight wasn't tracking everything because i wasn't in range of the snails a lot of the time overall though i didn't really mind either of the methods i did 1500 kills with the magic short bow and 1500 kills were all cannoned obviously i would never recommend you bring a cannon here as that would definitely ruin any potential profit but i was just after the overall price of the loot uh personal gain wasn't really a priority from this one getting damaged by these snails can be a little annoying even if you are maxed but food was never needed if you do bring food you have a chance at getting stolen anyway by all the gas that surround this area it'll just be stolen and replaced with rotten food the gas are honestly more annoying than anything else in this swamp and if you don't mind the snails the ghosts then maybe the swamp decay just might be your tipping point from coming here because you will occasionally be dealt damaged by the swamp since it decays you over time if you do bring a silver sickle blessed or a rod of avandus you will be fine if you also complete the quest making friends with my arm and you have 50 construction you will be allowed to build the fire of dehumidification which will nullify the swamp decay and this will prevent your food from being stolen and you know turn into rotten this swamp is actually so deadly that as soon as you exit it the guy at the gate is even surprised that you made it the actual name of mort meyer swamp may be derived from the french word for death mort and meyer an uncommon french word for leech but an english alteration could be translated to death swamp either way this place is definitely no fun you know get in do what you got to do and get out as soon as you can and as seen in the beginning of the video you don't have to walk through the gates to reach this location you can use the fairy ring code bkr and you will be smack in the center of all these snails it's perfect for cannoning and perfect for an easy way in this is a popular fairy ring code for those who spawn mort meyer fungus that fungus is crucial for super energy potions i mean without them we'd all be moving very very slow slow just like the snails and with that ladies and gentlemen here we are loot from 3 000 snails has been completed like i said this took four days uh really just playing on and off i didn't really know life this one wasn't really motivated to as you can imagine but overall after collecting so many different uh shells i really just kind of decided towards the end that let me just get a thousand lean a thousand fat and a thousand thin snails a piece and not prioritize the shells as much so with that being said the overall loot from three thousand snails according to the grand exchange price is 3.2 mil and that is rounded up now that seems like a lot for such a low level monster but the real question is is any of this stuff going to sell uh whether it's the shell or whether it's the meat i'm really not too sure so now we're gonna find out gonna go to the grand exchange putting the blemish red shells in for 90 each and it looks like we just got a hundred each a piece for that so that's not too bad and as it goes for the blemish blue shells uh those sold way over price i was expecting 35k but we got over 80k and as it goes for the sharper version of the blemish blue as well as the blemish red um as it goes for those the blemish red shells really did sell pretty nicely uh but the blue ones were selling for just about 1k each which is half of what they were expected to sell at here we have the blemish ocher shell god i hate that word uh it's like one gp as it goes for the sharp version yeah one gp for that too i don't even know why people are buying this for one gp but hey i guess someone's gotta make a profit uh the blemish mire shell same scenario one gp apiece for the uh large and the sharp one so not even worth killing uh as it goes for the orange one same story with that just a little bit more than one gp each this time but anyway now it's time to sell the snails so the thin snail sold for 375 a piece and now we have the fat snail this one we'll put in for 500 gp each but it looks like they all instantly sold for 1.2 k a piece and now we have the lean snail which according to the grand exchange price this is the most expensive one of them all but go figure it's actually the opposite this one is the cheapest snail of them all so don't let the prices fool ya clearly the fat snail is the way to go and the greatest thing about that is the most expensive snelms are connected to the fat snail whether it's the blue one or the black one that is where you're going to be making the most profit so hypothetically if you can get 200 kills an hour and you only kill the fat snails then i think it's safe to say that you can make anywhere from 300 to 500k an hour which is not too bad at such a low combat of a monster to kill overall for me since i killed a little bit of everything i made two mil so no worries there was a good experience i learned a lot of new things about snails today and yeah i don't think this will ever change unless they uh buff the other snails drop tables or maybe just give them another use to the game in general so we'll see if that ever happens but anyway thank you guys so much for watching until next time mr nose sleep out
