hey guys welcome back to another video jagex and i have been talking and they sent me over some numbers about cheating on runescape we're gonna talk about those stats first and then bust some bots now you guys know i talk a lot about bots the stats jackets have provided today might help shed some light on why i talk about it so much let's start out with the annual amount of gp jagex removes from old school runescape alone because the gold has something to do with rule breaking that number is 3.5 trillion gp to put that into perspective you could buy 875 000 dragonfire shields with 3.5 trillion gp if you were to break the rules and sell the gold on the black market it would be worth almost 2 million us dollars and that's just the gold that gets removed from the game in a single year you could buy 55 teslas with the old school runescape gp that gets removed every year this isn't the total black market either since it's the amount of gold that was flagged and removed obviously we don't know how much illegitimate gold slipped through the cracks so when i'm investigating or talking about players gold farming botting scamming or luring to then sell the gold we're talking about a multi-million dollar black market of old school runescape gp the next stat is how many accounts are banned annually before i tell you the number comment below how many you think it is this would include any form of rule breaking that results in a ban so botting buying or selling gold etc that number is roughly 7 million accounts that's about 19 000 accounts per day i know it's really frustrating to see rule breaking in game but most of these accounts life expectancies have got to be pretty low if nineteen thousand get hit with a ban hammer every day eighty percent of that seven million are old school runescape accounts one of the top locations for player submitted reports is lumbridge spawn i guess that makes sense though since lots of bots are created and banned rapidly and free to play and every single account starts out in the same spot i'm guessing some players have camped it before and reported the bots sirpugger the links in the description now account security is a huge issue on old school runescape when i made a video about players finding out their account was hacked and bought it on i got thousands more emails and comments about similar things happening to other people now here's another stat jagex actually locked over 100 000 compromised accounts last year often times an account owner won't even know their account has been compromised before jagex locks it remember to not click on any phishing links and have two-factor authentication on my videos usually highlight the problem so it's refreshing to see what has actually been done to combat it millions of accounts are being banned trillions of gp is being removed and hundreds of thousands of accounts are locked to prevent hacking every year now that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement jagex posted a blog article about some potential anti-cheating updates that hinted at something major in october it also outlined some of the problems with chat moderation and player support requests that jagex is currently working to solve as many of you know mod west left and was a major public figure in the anti-cheating team but there is actually a team of seven anti-cheating people they're all trained in old school and runescape 3 to deal with botting fishing hacking real world trading and other problems i know some people in the community were worried when mod wet left but just remember there's a large team of people trained to work on this behind the scenes now let's get into some bot busting i was recently tipped off to a massive new bop farm and it takes place on world 425 the bot farm is all level 10 accounts playing lms in a free to play world almost no free to play players actually play lms when this bot farm isn't active there seem to be at least 75 to 100 bots running at one time when the bot farm's active though what's weird is they won't join the game if there are too many real players in the lobby but eventually i was able to get into a game with the bots but what was even weirder is the bots around me when we started the game would instantly leave the game once it started to combat point farming like this in lms jagex has made the point system a little bit more difficult to actually obtain a point to get any points at all you have to kill at least one player in the game for free to play so at first i didn't really understand what the bots were doing since they just left the game obviously not getting any points it took me at least 10 different tries to actually find the bots in the mini game a couple other people who were playing the mini-game with me helped me out and i think we figured it out the bots instantly leave the mini-game if there's a real player around them they're not equipped to fight real players so they know that the real player would kill them they wouldn't have any kills and they wouldn't get any points but if only bots spawn in the same area they'll kill each other unlocking that ability to get points from there i'm not quite sure what happens but it seems like the bots end up hiding in the upper story of buildings until the final rounds when the announcement comes that fog is rolling in the bots then start running to the final area now one of the keys here is that free to play lms is super inactive so sometimes only bots could be in the game together i joined a game that i'm pretty sure was only bought accounts within the first 10 seconds of joining there were only three people left i'm pretty sure that bots officially kill each other and donate any food but free to play lms can be one of the best free-to-play money makers in the game one lms point can go for 30k gp so let's say there was only a bot farm in lms first through eighth place would end up being awarded a total of 15 points which is roughly 300k and the games when you're not even eating food could take less than a couple minutes when i was joining these games i got first place almost every time and within less than 30 minutes i was able to get 1.2 million gp worth of points i can't confirm this whatsoever but some guys in the chat did say the bot owner was bragging about how many points he was getting they were saying he claimed he gets 9k points per week which translates to like 300 million gp there are so many easy ways to fix this bot farm though like if there are even three real players playing the mini-game at once the bot farm starts losing points rapidly but you always have to be on the lookout for content that people aren't using to see if bot farms pop up to try to abuse the game i'm not quite sure what's going on here there are a bunch of level 72s rune full helms adam and play bodies rune plate legs alking and members worlds at the grand exchange i was able to find one of them that resembles the tip off i got i don't know why they have such high melee stats if they're just alkbots i could only find one of them but the guy who tipped me off had found at least three different ones that exactly resemble this account they do all have basically the same stats and bot like names i don't know if they're bots i'm guessing they are let me know in the comments if you guys know what these bots are doing i guess they could just be alking stuff but why the other stats at this next location i've hunted bots before but i never realized how out of control it's gotten the last couple weeks i got this super wholesome tip about the deep wildy slayer dungeon apparently there's a new bot army telegraphing wines of zamarak down there the guy who sent me the tip has made over 600k in wines of zamarak just from smashing the bots so that's pretty cool when i went to go check it out though there were bots logging in right and left around me they're all about level 34 or 35. it seems like they're also pretty well programmed they log out almost instantly when they see another player so i geared up on my low level pure and even just from the edgeville lever i actually ran into one of the bots i'm pretty sure these bots just use the mage arena bank so i don't know why this bot was so out of place they also drop up to 50 law runes which are stackable so it's pretty easy to collect those if you actually want to make some money though you can also collect the wines of zamarak a lot of them have like over 40 wines of xamaric on them what's also interesting is we can definitely calculate the exact amount of gp each of these low-level bots have made all of them are between 58 and 60 magic at 60 magic you have about 280 000 magic experience when you cast telekinetic grab you get 43 magic experience so each of these bots have grabbed over 6 000 wines of xamaric and if you multiply those by the market price of the wines 1100 gp you get about seven million gp per bot now there were between one to three bots on almost every world i checked let's just estimate low ball it that there are 50 bots out there that means the bot farm has made 350 mil total they've been around for a week or two i'm not exactly sure but we know exactly how much these bots have made i don't know if you guys have been noticing this but a lot of the big bot farms these days have their default clothes set to purple i'm not sure if there's like some bulk account seller that services botters that sells purple accounts to them or if all of these bot farms are actually the same botter or group of botters i don't know what it is but i just keep seeing so many purple bots i would definitely recommend killing these guys though and the easiest way to make a friend on runescape is to be killing bots doing the same money maker around a real player huge shout out to this guy he was one of only like two real players i saw out here the higher level adam and plate body g-bots are still here from a few months ago but they're different accounts so it's not like they've been doing this the whole time in the end though even if you just collect the law runes it stacks up pretty nicely 10 out of 10 training method as well i've gotten multiple tip-offs about bot-like accounts killing firewatch sentinels the requirements to kill these are pretty high though because you have to have completed the sins of the father quest the wiki says you get about 850k per hour so it is a pretty good moneymaker as well some of the tips i got recommended i close the door to the altar to see if the accounts react in any specific way a bot would probably try to open the door click on the alter and be messed up when you close the door over and over and over again so i tried this with a few accounts but the problem is a lot of them resemble gold farmers as well a gold farmer might not say anything in game if you're messing with them either it's also a super afk activity so it can be hard to tell i was messing with the most bot-like accounts i could find here and actually a real pvm are around me and i teamed up and almost got one of the accounts killed because they ran out of prayer and either was a gold farmer who really didn't know how to play the game or was definitely a bot but nowadays in-game you can only open and close doors three times before they get stuck to prevent griefing which i totally understand it was so hard to tell what these accounts actually were and i'd gotten so many tips that i decided to choose six different suspect accounts and send their usernames to jagex they got back to me and told me that one was a normal player four were hand-played gold farmer accounts and one was a bot they didn't go into specifics but confirming that at least one of those accounts was a bot means there is a bot farm active there it's just almost impossible to tell which accounts are bots they also told me the average amount of wealth on each account was 8.8 mil jagex also said they offloaded their items in gold on a daily basis for sale they said they're going to take a more in-depth look into this as well it was super awesome to hear from jagex and have them confirm what i was looking into and tell me some stats now this tip-off might be related and originally this guy thought these accounts were trolling but he saw a bunch of level 111s all with different court bot usernames it totally seems like a troll like why would anyone name their actual high-level bot farm court bot but the tip does say that he saw them stuck at the puzzle part of the sims of the father quest for at least 20 minutes and they were logging in and out and just getting stuck at the puzzle repeatedly i definitely do think it's some kind of troll though
