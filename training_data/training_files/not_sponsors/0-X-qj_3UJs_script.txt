trial at the link in the description below Travis Scott is one of the most influential artists of the last five years the strength of Travis's creative vision has been unrivaled since the beginning of his career as a protege of Kanye West in the early 2010's in this video I'm going to be ranking the two mixtapes and four albums and Travis's catalog from worst to best okay so I hope no one's too surprised over my last place pick quavo and Travis are longtime collaborators and the migos rapper has been present on every single one of Travis's projects since his 2014 next eight days before rodeo some of Travis's most popular songs feature quavo such as oh my decide from rodeo and pick up the phone from birds somehow despite this history of hits Pancho Jack falls flat on his face the energy on honcho jack is so lopsided that the album basically ends up sounding like one long boring song honcho Jack feels like it was designed more by Travis and Cuevas labels than the rapper's themselves it employs almost every low-grade cliche present in hip-hop today and with the least energy possible at that this album is saved from being unlistenable only by a couple of cool samples the occasional catchy hook and hard-hitting base throughout honcho jack sixth place 4/5 I'm gonna have to choose a low Ferrum now don't get me wrong this mixtape definitely has some bangers and it aged way better than a lot of what was being put out in 2013 its main problem lies in the fact that Travis just hadn't yet decided who he wanted to be his personality and recognizable style is what makes his music so good and it just hadn't fully developed yet on a low fare Oh Travis was still using the amateurish dollar sign in his name and the songs on this mixtape are all over the place there's EDM party rap dancehall and none of it really makes all that much sense put together that being said Al Ferro is an incredibly forceful and ambitious first mixtape that left few people in doubt that Travis was capable of making music Travis was able to pull together all of the trends of the day and turn them into something dark twisted and deeply atmospheric it's worth a couple of listens at the least el faro fifth-place and so this is where things get a little difficult birds in the trap sing McKnight has a bad reputation the album was delayed multiple times and a lot of fans saw it as filler while Travis put off the release of the rumored rodeo sequel Astroworld a Travis himself went on record saying that 2018 s Astroworld was supposed to be a second album and birds was a throwaway and it totally shows birds just didn't have enough effort or energy put into it the beautiful dark twisted sort of aesthetic that Travis was going for it's kind of there but it's just not well fleshed out you can tell the album just didn't have enough time put into it moments like the opening and the haunting sdp interlude shine a bit of light on what birds could have been but it lacks the energy that Travis is capable of both in production and vocals making the rest of this record empty and unoriginal the only reason I'm raking is above a la Pharoah is because it's way more consistent it's mixed better and it's much more mature sounding birds in the trap sing McKnight fourth place so now we're in the top three and the first installment of the rodeo trilogy is going to take third place days before rodeo is Travis's second mixtape and it came out in 2014 DB our improved on 2013 a lo Pharoah in every way Travis's energy on here is unprecedented mixtape is brooding dark and sinister songs like drugs you should try it basement freestyle and mamacita are among the best travis has ever recorded this mixtape marked the first time people really paid attention to Travis Scott as a potential future superstar DBR is rough it wasn't mixed well and it suffers from a bit of somatic inconsistency but that's part of what makes mixtapes so interesting what matters is that it's overflowing with the raw energy that would eventually propel Travis to the top other rap game dates before a rodeo third place I'd say that Astroworld lived up to the height at least as well as we could ask it to because on the one hand it's impossible to live up to height but completely that's the nature of hype when you wait for something for two years there's always going to be a metaphorical Navs verse on you cemani but there's just something about astral world that's on another level for years Travis was little more than a master of imitation drawing from the sonic footprints of his mentors Kanye West and Kid Cudi Astroworld finally escaped their immense gravitational pull with the collaboration from legends like Drake Frank Ocean Stevie Wonder and more in a first for Travis this record feels like one cohesive work of art it's not filling quotas for bangers and pop songs and that makes all the difference for Travis Scott Astroworld is big it's comprehensive and it sounds amazing I'm not gonna stop listening to it anytime soon Astroworld second place rodeo is the definitive trap album the production is insane the features are next-level and travis has never put more effort into his performances before or after everything Travis dropped before rodeo was leading up to it quite literally with days before rodeo everything after it has been looked at as a pale imitation there are no bad songs on this album it paces itself and there's not a single moment on here that I can call boring rodeo is hypnotic dark and deeply nihilistic it's a true hip-hop opera and those just don't come around very often without a doubt rodeo is one of the best hip-hop albums to come out this decade and definitely the best rap album ever made I'll probably do an entire video just on rodeo at some point so I'm going to end it at this who else could put young thug and Justin Bieber on a song together and make it a hit this has been my ranking of travis scott's albums from worst to best if you
