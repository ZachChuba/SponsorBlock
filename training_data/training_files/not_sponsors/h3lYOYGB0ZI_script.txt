whenever you look up the most popular Chinese dishes around the world at the top of the list there's pretty much always some type of sweet-and-sour general Tao style probably deep-fried probably chicken but today I want to show you a real traditional Chinese sweet-and-sour sauce for the sophisticated adults like you and me I am of course talking about the citron nice pew shank flavor which just so happens to be the perfect companion for pretty much my favorite eggplant dish of all time the buttery sweet and sour in Zhang eggplant this is part 3 in my series on the amazing food of such won one of the big culinary families of citron by Joe to people outside of China born that later but for now let's talk about sweet and sour south and first of all yes it's true there's a lot of sweet and sour food in China there are tons of regional varieties all the way from the north to the south from the coast into the mainland but all of these local sweet and sour dishes have at least two ingredients in common one there's always some type of sugar and two there's always some type of vinegar hence sweet and sour and when you look at it historically it makes a lot of sense you see China has been very early to the global sugar game starting to cultivate and refined sugar cane over a thousand years back which is when Buddhist monks brought the technology over from India where sugar refining probably originated but you know what China has been even earlier to the vinegar game in fact vinegar appears quite a number of times in a very well-preserved ancient Chinese book called Chi Minh Yahoo foo which by the way means something like how normal people manage to get by and this book contains a lot of ancient farming techniques and recipes super interesting and with that deep history it's not surprising that your Asian grocery store usually holds quite the selection of Chinese vinegars whenever you're looking for a mild and neutral variety go for white rice vinegar in northern China that type of vinegar plus some regular white sugar is all you need to make the sweet and sour sauce to the local favorite and these days in many parts of China it's a similar story maybe with a few small additions it's an open secret for example that the very fancy looking squirrel shaped fish don't worry there's no squirrel in there is actually made with pretty much the same basic sweet and sour sauce and the addition of ketchup it's pretty much the same with the ever popular Cantonese ghoul ro even though that was traditionally made with ha berries as I learned when Chinese cooking demystified and then this flavor is further enhanced by the addition of pineapple or other exotic fruits and since a lot of the early Chinese immigrants that ventured into the world came from that region of China I like to see goole ro as sort of the granddaddy or should I say sugar daddy of all Chinese sweet and sour dishes that kind of helped popularize this flavor profile all over the world but guys let's be real well all of these dishes are pretty delicious they can also see him a little bit like kids can be melted over fried chicken and this is where we get to the food of such one which also features a number of sweet and sour eaters but they all seem a little more sophisticated a little more exquisite and one of the most famous authentic examples for this would be any dish that comes from this big family where all dishes start with who's young anything you're sharing sauces like this incredible marriage of a sweet and sour sauce a pretty complex tasting one if I may say and some spiciness but not an overwhelming amount the spiciness comes from a fermented chili and bean paste called open jam which you should be able to find in most Asian grocery stores you can also use sambal oelek or even sriracha as a substitute another big reason for this nuanced taste of the you shank flavor is the vinegar this is what you can really make use of that huge selection in your Asian grocery store if you're lucky you can find a dark vinegar called Bonnie this is the original Sichuan stuff but if I may give you a little piece of advice with Chinese vinegar I find that you usually get what you pay for so I definitely recommend getting the highest and bounding you can find it's really worth it the flavor will be super fragrant and complex but even if you can't find boning every Chinese store will have this other vinegar called Chang Chang or gen Jiang it's a very reasonable substitute and if you really need an emergency option just go for balsamic vinegar it sounds a bit weird but it kind of works both of these two special ingredients are fermented and will last a very very long time so it's really worth having them around everything else you need for a new shank sauce should be pretty easy to find anywhere in the world and so in the search for a base recipe I turn to the book when it comes to situation which is of course fuchsia Dunlop's the food of sich one I think it's safe to say that fuchsia Dunlop is a V leading English language expert when it comes to this this book has a few bution recipes but the one I want to cook with you guys today is this one you shall eggplant my all-time favorite and for that we're gonna need some eggplants if you can get the purple Asian eggplant great if not just use any other kind cut it into batons then sprinkle with some salt and toss we do this to soften and dehydrate the eggplant after which you want to Pat it SuperDrive this step will usually take at least 30 minutes so just enough time for me to pick up the food of citron read this amazing book realize that I have so many more questions if there was only a way I could speak to the author of this book I just felt that cetera nice food is having a moment now of global recognition and I wanted to write a bit ladies and gentlemen the author of this book the one and only fuchsia Dunlop citron food expert well I think there is this very dominating stereotype but it's all about Marla numbing and hot lots of chilies and Szechuan pepper and indeed that is a serious might with in China as well but actually it's much more subtle than that local chefs would say that they're sort of Maxim is you tiger by highway which means each dish has its own style and a hundred dishes have a hundred different flavors so that's the thing really that I think that people just don't recognize this stunning variety and the fact that a good such Chinese meal is a sort of journey of the palate okay so why don't we actually have a bona fide search one food expert on the line let's reveal the biggest mystery surrounding the you shank flavor where does that weird name come from what does you shag actually mean in your book you translate it as fish fragrance can you tell me a little bit like about where that name comes from it's such a mystery to most people that look into this thing it's very straight so it's the two characters literally for fish and fragrant which I think sounds rather exciting and you know unusual but the thing that's really surprising is that there's no fish in it the flavor profile is pickled chilies ginger garlic spring onion a bit of sugar and vinegar but what the local explanation for this curious name is that it uses the seasonings for a traditional fish cookery and indeed it uses the same ingredients that are used to cook fish particularly in southern Szechuan there is an alternative explanation which is that in the past when people were pickling their long red chilies are a GTR a local variety of Chile they pickle them in brine and sometimes people would pop a few raw crucian carp fish into the pickle jar to sort of enhance the umami flavor and as they ping called the fish would sort of disintegrate and just improve the flavor one of my friends thinks that there's a tradition in China of sort of literate gentleman giving poetic names to dishes so maybe this one's a dish that people are so style of flavor that people already cooking and then someone want they said oh let's call it fish fragrant because it uses the seasonings for fish cookery exactly so we have an idea of what the you shank flavor actually is and it's great but listen when you combine this flavor with an eggplant in the right way something something incredible happens you should plan it has this magical ability to become everyone's favorite Chinese dish at some point in time when they get into Chinese cooking and eating what is your guess why is this a dish that you and many many other people just fall in love with forever well firstly it has this amazingly luxurious mouthfeel texture so you start by deep-frying the aubergine the eggplants till their release of buttery and golden so have that lovely melt in the mouth consistency and then there is this layering of flavors so there's a bit of sweetness which I think most people find appealing but it's balanced by a sort of spritz of vinegar so you get the sweet at the sweet-and-sour it's just one of those flavors that everyone loves but here it's it's not a real in-your-face sweet and sour it's a sort of it's just one element and then you have a bit of spiciness and then all those rich flavors of ginger garlic and spring onions sizzling oil which create this richness of flavor and then of course it looks beautiful because it has this very sort of appealing you know red colour from the chili bean sauce or the pickled chilies which is actually very typical as such when he's cooking and also for me it's just that dish is kind of miracle because it's such basic ingredients I mean it's just a glance over jeans and it's so delicious and as you said everyone loves it and I've even you know I've cooked that dish for Turkish friends and the Turks are real you know aubergine experts and so fuchsia is about to drop some more serious wisdom like what to do if you don't want to deep fry your eggplant or do you really have to use the long purple Chinese eggplant but we'll get to all of that after a quick drink with best regards from this video sponsor ming river by joe actually wait let me just blow your mind for just a second we used three different fermented ingredients for the ocean eggplant right the chili bean paste soy sauce and vinegar so in case you haven't noticed yet fermented things are all over chinese cooking and they all require one thing and that's called chew chew is basically like a sourdough starter but for your favorite fermented condiments but here's the kicker cheap production originated as part of an ancient winemaking technique so guess what is also made from Chiu no no yes it's Ming River bite you I kid you not chew is what actually turns the grains used for bide your production into that sweet sweet alcohol and because chew is pretty much made from microorganisms that are being harvested from quite literally the air around you it's no surprise that every region's true will taste differently and that is what gives Ming River Szechuan by Jo its unique aroma okay now I definitely need a drink and to pair with you Shang eggplant today we're making a long drink called general Ming it couldn't be simpler equal amounts of Ming River by Jo and red vermouths top-up with tonic water and then just give a lemon rind a little squeeze for that citrus oil and so general main it is on another early morning drinking session for me I hope it's okay to drink this with a straw listen if you like gin tonic you're gonna love this one this is actually really good I definitely finish this one right now but I still have a video to edit Thank You Ming River for sponsoring this series if you guys are interested in trying the flavor of the original citron by Jo ming river is 100% the way to go and they're available in the US and europe check out the links in the video description to find out how you can get your hands on some of this stuff but now back to fuchsia dunlop and some expert level you shan't eggplant cooking tips but how important is it to use the Chinese eggplant versus a Western eggplant the most beautiful you see on teaser is made with the sort of purple eggplant and you can see the photograph in my book which is actually that my favorite photo in the book I managed to get the Chinese purple and then it just adds this iridescent purple color and it's totally beautiful but actually flavor-wise the dish is really about the flavor combination and don't think it matters it's delicious whichever way you do it you deep-fry it right if you pass it through oil i'ma think it's worth it isn't it see you I mean when it when is the frame not worth it right a lot of people are like Baby Love eating it but when it comes to cooking you share a little bit deep frying is always a little bit of a step firstly I would say that what one reason that people don't like deep frying is it needs so much oil but the way I do this at home is that I actually fry the the eggplants in several batches so I don't use that much oil and then you could reuse the oil for seasoning of the warp or for other things I have also done it by roasting the eggplant in the oven so that they are golden a bit caramelized problem with that method is that it doesn't fix the shape so if you then take them out of the oven tray and put them into the sauce they disintegrate it'll still taste good but it'll be more like a mush and there is another way that I've also done it as a dish served either hot or cold maybe for a buffet is that you cook them in a tray in the oven and then make the sauce and pour it all over them if I was serving it not hot but cold then I would not thicken the sauce so maybe use a little less liquid so I would say that if you really don't want to deep fry then yes roasted in the oven pour the sauce over so they don't disintegrate but it's just a slightly different sort of dish so plants are not the only things right that are being cooked in the juices and flavor what other options what other popular options are there well I mean the most famous one really is you see an ulcer which is like and pork slivers there's a recipe in the book two thin slivers of pork with a bit of wood ear mushroom and then either Celsus let it stem or or bamboo shoot' usually that is the real classic actually more so than the fish fragrant eggplant which is more like a homestyle dish you can do cold fish fragrant dishes I've got in the book a source for cold poached chicken with this fragrant sauce and that sometimes used for rabbit or chicken fish fragrant seafood in season the tender shoots of oilseed rape just for like one month the winter they will do in the fish fragrant sauce which are delicious yeah and then also if you go to a Muslim restaurant they'll be doing probably lamb or beef in a first-rate lentils so it's really about flavor and you can do whatever you like there curiously the only thing that you never have really is is a fish fragrant fish
