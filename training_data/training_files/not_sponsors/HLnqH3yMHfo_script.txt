oh hello this video relies heavily on the following premise when you take Magic the Gathering which is a collectible card game and you sell packs and sell drafts in order for players to buy and collect those cards but then limit your game to a standard format we're once per year essentially half of that collection can no longer be played with and you have no option to dust or otherwise convert or redeem those no longer playable cards for our cards you can play with then you have a game where players must continuously pay to get packs of cards that will continually be disabled from play requiring more packs to be bought and cracked only to have those cards disabled from play you have a one-way system where money is continually going from the customer into the game in a way that offers zero permanence when standard is all there is you could spend thousands on magic arena but once you stop regularly spending that money no matter how many cards you already own on arena if that wait is long enough everything you have bought will have been disabled if there is nothing other than standard then they might as well just be deleting half your collection once per year and offering nothing in return that in my evaluation is the current state of magic arena despite the implementation of the historic format and I believe it is a state that Wizards of the coast wishes to maintain [Music] bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla this video is not just about wanting pioneer on Magic arena yes I like many Magic the Gathering players would like to see plans to bring pioneer to arena in fact as I'll argue arena historic should just be arena pioneer but this video is about more than just that this is a video about many interconnected issues the magic arena economy the intentional sabotaging of the historic format the exploitative nature of a standard only system and ultimately it is about whether magic arena will have a sustainable future or just end up as a short-term lucrative cash grab let's start at the very beginning magic arena caught my attention and excitement from the very start that was that has gone and got to experience the early alpha demo of the program as the cards flew across the screen all my reservations and cynicism about this upcoming digital client melted away I saw everything the magic digital experience could and I believed truly believed would be I was sold beyond impressed with what Wizards of the coast had put together I was 100% on board I wanted magic arena to succeed and become all that it could be I still do I love this game the fact that the client would start out with only draft and standard made sense as programming in old sets would be a slow process and even at a steady pace of adding old sets a format like modern for example might take half a decade or more to be fully on arena now that didn't stop me from arguing that modern should still be built towards on arena after all Magic the Gathering is over a quarter of a century old so what's a few half decades but to me the first major red light was when the economy was fully unveiled that's when I knew something had gone wrong no trading of cards was one thing but no dusting or other form of redemption system for cards that we don't want or that have rotated out of standard that carried with it the very negative implications that I outlined at the start of this video no matter how much money you spend or how many hours you put into the game when there is nothing other than standard well then might as well just be deleting half your collection once per year I have talked at length on this channel about how vital non-standard formats are to the larger ecosystem of magic the gathering that while standard is indeed the premier gateway format and the one that Wizards of the coast sees as overall the most profitable a variety of other formats are still needed other ways to play are still critical because well players can get sick of standard standard is like the tide it ebbs and it flows it can and has gone bad it can and has become stale or even busted in the past some might argue that these things are true in the present but I promise you they will again be true in the future it's the cycle of standard it's great it gets bad it gets fixed it gets great again it gets bad again but if all Arena has a standard and standard goes sour with no viable alternatives then that player base is likely going to start to disappear so I've just established the two most critical problems with arenas standard only system first and most importantly without any system of dusting or redemption half your card collection is essentially disabled once per year and second in a standard only system when standard becomes a terrible game play environment see well now then there is no other way to play and enjoy arena when the only format on is broken what is the solution well the solution would have been to pursue a slightly less exploitative economy one that used a dusting or other Redemption system sadly the toothpaste is out of that tube now our best remaining solution the historic format the premises that by having a non-rotating format on magic arena then players are not fully losing access to half their collection yes they are losing that access in terms of playing standard brawl etc but if there is an alternative way to play with those cards on arena an alternative format that does not ever rotate than the nature of spending cash on assets that are eventually disabled is changed a non-rotating format transforms the magic arena economy and environment to one where you keep your collection and have uses for it also I might add it means that you have something to play other than standard when standard goes sour so there's a lot of importance behind historic it's not just an alternative game mode for some players it is a vital part of magic arena because without it player collections are just being disabled once a year but it has conditions it has requirements otherwise it's a meaningless addition historic needs to be a fully developed and supported format if there's no reason to actually sit and play historic then there's no benefit to having historic remember we need historic to justify all these cards we are collecting that can no longer be used and standard so if there's no reason to play historic such as the format not being fun or not being supported the mere fact that it is there does nothing historic only changes the nature of the arena economy if it is a format arena players are playing unfortunately Wizards of the coast seems to have taken extreme steps to ensure historic is essentially dead on arrival after trying to discourage players from the format by instituting a two from one wildcard redemption policy Wizards yielded to player complaints and kept the redemption policy at one for one and decided instead to simply offer historic once per month I will repeat that because it bears repeating historic events will only occur once per month so magic arena players simply cannot log in at any time and play historic rather there will be one day per month in which they are able to do so now yes historic will be something you can direct challenge a friend with at any time but the absence of a working friends list negates the ability of many to fully enjoy that feature not to mention that games of historic will not offer experience ranking or even count towards daily rewards and there will be no option to play a full game of magic in historic and these games will all be best of one only no best of three I think it is very fair to say that when you offer the historic format one day per month with no rewards or incentives that you are doing everything short of not offering it at all it is clear this is being done because Wizards of the coast wants you to play standard and only standard but as I have established this not only means people will be more likely to give up on arena during the times when standard goes sour it means that the overall client economy is essentially disabling half your collection once per year historic as a format when implemented like this does nothing it might as well not be implemented at all what then is the solution well for starters just offer historic events 24/7 with a full best-of-three capability and enabled earning of experience and daily rewards but I think there's an even better solution it's a solution quizzically that was given to us by a different hand of Wizards of the coast that solution is the Pioneer format much in the same way as people were shocked that brawl was not actually designed with arena in mind I find myself shocked that pioneer was not designed with arena in mind because it not only solves all of the economic problems that I've covered in this video but it brings with it amazing enhancements for the user experience on arena with an emphasis on player retention well I do have some reservations about the overall Pioneer format there is absolutely no reservation no doubt in my mind whatsoever that Pioneer is everything historic should have been all Wizards of the coast needed to do was launched a clearly laid out arena pioneer plan what do I mean by arena pioneer well obviously they can't just push a button and program in all of Pioneer right away but it isn't nearly as many sets as modern and thus I believe that adopting a plan to gradually over several years add the old sets to arena would still provide us with a fun and engaging format an alternative to standard in the interim arena already has all of Khaled Esch block and almond Kat block and half of Shadows block programmed on so in order to have full pioneer we'd need a little over a dozen sets to be added a total of 15 that's no small number but again arena pioneer could launch with flash back drafting for almond Kat adding those cards to the pool and also giving an additional way to play arena through flashback drafting and thus arena pioneer can create a pattern gradually releasing old sets by a flashback drafts starting with the 2.5 sets already programmed into arena to allow time to program in further sets release these sets gradually over time working your way back through the remaining 15 sets to reach return to Ravnica and thus have full pioneer on arena it will take time but during that time there will be a growing and evolving arena pioneer format how exciting to see that arena pioneer format change and develop as throughout each year sets like shadows over innistrad and Khan's of tarkir are added in what a change of pace to take a break from the standard draft set and flashback draft those sets instead and eventually over many years we will reach return to Ravnica and then have full pioneer on arena and once we have full pioneer and arena we have it forever I believe firmly and strongly that this should be the plan and I believe it is both reasonable and would be highly beneficial to arena I believe arena is starting to show cracks already in many areas including software performance and stability that's another video but that the problems of a standard only environment will just facilitate more and more player drop off if we don't pursue something like pioneer the smartest thing Wizards of the coast can do with arena now is to fully embrace a plan for arena pioneer and otherwise get over themselves enough to say that arena is not just standard rename historic as arena pioneer immediately have 24/7 events and access and make a pledge to release sets going backwards starting with flashback drafting of almond cat into Cal adesh both of which are already on the system giving them time to program in the other half of Shadows and then work backwards towards previous sets gradually and over time embrace a diversity of formats at the very least offer historic 24/7 instead of one day month at the very least offer brawl 24/7 instead of one day per week if nothing else it is critical that Wizards of the coast recognize that forcing players to play standard is a flawed philosophy they will end up forcing players not to play standard but forcing them instead off of arena and on to other games but that of course is just my evaluation now I want to hear from you are you excited for historic on arena as it stands do you agree with me about the importance for a fully supported non-rotating format on arena and does historic currently meet that criteria how do you feel about possibly working towards arena pioneer over several years is that something that we just don't want to wait around for and should just abandon and not pursue or is it a goal that you would like to see let me know in the comments below and
