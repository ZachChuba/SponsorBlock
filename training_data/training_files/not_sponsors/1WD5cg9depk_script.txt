friends it's me your favorite bucket of KFC today I got some crispy juicy and tender design fails y'all thought I was gonna say chicken you go to the bathroom you lift up the seat you lift up the other seat they put it on wrong it's supposed to go cover see see toilet bowls I don't make this mistake that's like me working on McDonald's making a burger and doing bun Boxberger it's just an order you can't get wrong either way I'm squatting whoa it's the big chunks of toilet paper rolls touching the toilet though oh it's like once they come in contact useless you can't use it anymore how would you even unroll that it's like an industrial-sized paper towel roll this even for toilets well it even flush who's really bugging me how you can't even put down the seat because the humongous toilet paper rolls is just oh it's in the way sleeve get flushed or something here we have an absolute abomination of a bathroom you know I actually set foot in the house the other day that was built in the 60s and they had carpeted bathrooms that was a thing back then but really around a bathtub like who needs a towel when you could just get up out of the bathtub roll yourself on the carpet you know my dogs do that after I give them a bath you telling me humans used to do that back then and why does it got a whole canopy it's got a shower but no curtains I'm sorry but your bathroom is aggravating oh yes the glass toilet so you and anybody else in the room or who walks in can see what you've done yeah I think this looks pretty cool I think it would be pretty neato don't you think so much like if you and uses toilet then we have a bathroom stall but they completely forgot that humans have legs and knees and when you sit on a toilet you need some space to sit you know okay but why economy airplanes needs to be like that's the kind of legroom you're gonna get goes to a cheapo hotel yes sir give me your best room I want the city view opens up the curtains there's no window sucks this is an accurate representation of my life this is why I don't get hyped up for things anymore every time I open a thing of curtains is always wall we got the men's room and we got the man's in a skirt room doesn't even look like a woman's logo or maybe it's like a big and tall sick lady with a skirt you know what is 2019 we can't even call this a lady of what's a ridiculous this modern contemporary house hall tried to be extra fancy and have their sink and their toilet part of the same piece now this one always sounded like a good idea until your toothbrush fell in the toilet and you know what you conveniently made a slide for all your toiletries to fall in the toilet that's why they call them toiletries also why your toilet built like that it was a rectangle I was just and it's available on iOS and Android so check that out you know what we'll put the yarn on right here I'll put the sink right here don't accidentally go on the wrong one Simon tells me there's a ninety seven point eight percent chance that somebody went in that sink for the man on the go now gotta wash your hands do your business that's the same time here we got a sign for a private restroom but you know what nothing really private these days not even a private restroom it's got a huge window what anyone who walks by can clearly see anything that goes down in here there ain't no privacy in this household or even worse this could be a school it could be your school smash like if you ain't got this in your school so your teacher can keep an eye on you at all times like Billy really went to the bathroom or not he a liar who's building the house for God put a fridge on the wall they're like oh hey you know what you're right people need fridges we forgot to put one on so it just makes us a little bucks for it in the middle of the room that's like okay you could put your fridge there yes it would look amazing and there's even like that little gap from the ceiling the fridge in like on top why is there so much gaps y'all didn't even measure oh this is hideous somebody actually moved into this house hey this oh here's what it looks like from behind yeah you know you got your whole kitchen right there you got a pantry and everything this is when you realize you just done messed up I'm like oh heck we're gonna have to put a fridge in huh there was a hundred and two percent chance that I will trip on this floor and this got me trippin because it looks flat it looks like I could just walk over it but there's stairs these are carpeted stairs I know this probably look like a good idea on paper like they picked out the carpet they're like this is beautiful perfect for my establishment and then puts it in like it don't even look like stairs you know sometimes you got to go through a dark narrow alleyway to do your business but what is this this is worse than an airplane bathroom I mean it's long but it's so narrow it's like only the toilet can fit what if you get stuck in between the walls I feel like if you are wider than a toilet bowl you will get stuck or you gotta like suck it I'm real good and like depose your way to the toilet sideways okay you know what I ain't even trying like we need a toilet but we don't have anywhere to put a toilet like there's barely enough room to put the seat down what is the same for real though bathrooms in New York and be like this you know there's only so much I can take but when you turn on the faucet and the water can't even go down the bowl somebody call 9-1-1 this is very upsetting no I'm not mad I'm just I'm just disappointed you try so hard and got so far in the end you weren't long enough what are you blaming the sink or the faucet grandma Gertrude loved this floral towel print so much she decided to upholster her entire bathroom with it okay you know what I'll take this over at the skinny legend hallway bathroom any day it looks soft wait where's the toilet paper oh you told me she went with a towel and then she just put it back like nothing happened no no oh oh my god I actually went on one of these escalators the other day not nearly as bad as this one but look like when you get to the top you literally have to like duck down like sit crisscross applesauce so you don't get your top half knocked off this is dangerous too much ceiling not enough stair try again my camera keeps spontaneously collapsing you know when you go into a fancy bathroom and they got a waiting area and your friend is getting rid of the taco ball from last night you just sit in there waiting like a good friend so they got these cool looking stools where you're supposed to wait and there's a sign so that Kurt abuse only no sitting you're not allowed to sit on these this is a bathroom not an art exhibit i'ma sit on these look at this first like I'm like wait what's wrong with this bathroom it looks like a normal bathroom right there's a toilet paper roll the shower that's legal whoever did this we've got a problem think you can even use that shower how would you even reach the toilet paper this has gotta be mrs. Incredibles toilet ain't nobody else could possibly live here okay you know what we got a gate for our house keep the gate closed and locked at all times a notice this is a warning completely walk around the imagine of burglar walking up to that house and be like oh shoot they got a gay dang it and goes back home look around it the stairs are right there guarding the air behind it is this in jail or something you gotta take your toilet paper before you go into the stall because the stalls don't have toilet paper and they got a lock on it so you can't steal the toilet paper one of the most valuable possessions in this world what if you go in there and let forget what if you don't have enough oh that's what I'm scared of you think it's done and it keeps going you meet more lord help me a lovely a garage to park my car but can your car go downstairs we got a garage but it's not car friendly wow they really won't let you put the seat down here like no piss stain up ain't nobody get a seat or you have to remove the entire bar to lift the seat okay not when I'm squatting Oh see this is what I was worried about with the monster roll but this is a regular sized roll blocking the toilet seat and you can't put it down you have to wait until half the toilet roll is finished for you to be able to put the seat down oh I'm getting a headache my toilet my throne even the sink on a throne you have to climb all three of these giant stairs to be worthy of using this toilet you know what seems pretty doable until you get to the top and there's literally nowhere to put your legs you gotta do like a McDonald's arch while you sit on that toilet man I thought this couldn't get worse with toilet paper placement that they had to have it inside a cabinet so before you go you take all the toilet paper you need and then you go I've about had it with y'all I can't believe these criminals that installed these are free live in that life in this world I don't feel safe anymore this set of stairs and there's just a giant enormous hole for Godzilla to work the nightshift on just a running through the stairs this is your apartment you got to get furniture or something big up this day is just not happening y'all done messed up excuse me what look at this driveway they didn't even bother they're just like oh yeah well the land it built like that just let the homeowner deal with it then you got like this sharp incline every time you want to leave your house weak so this toilet is not what I know it sounds crazy because it looks like it's wet but that's just the design so they want the toilet to look dirty but it's actually dirty it won't look dirty is that what y'all were going for cuz it looks gross these idiots actually put in a door upside down yeah so if any dogs want to come over they have to check in with your dog just to make sure it's okay it's like a big peephole for the dog so you know what that actually works out Cooper wanna have his friends over and they start scratching on the door you clearly go to the door confirm it it says canine friend from next door not a coyote that will eat him but anyways that's all for today I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did make sure that that like button in the paint colorful at which one of these was the worst and make sure you turned out notifications today today and make sure subscribe join the Wolfpack I love you guys so much thanks for watching bye guys
