address that jameson james [Music] i'm just gonna do it first time i did not do it first time doesn't seem like you can grab that i didn't see any button prompt i'm not sure if i did either [Music] oh oh oh you did it though right i did it though yeah i'm pretty yeah that's so cool you can't zip it as you're falling but if you get it like the frame perfect i think you can do it nice nicely done i think i might have just yeah you did like what else happened do you ever see full no i don't have any throwables okay i'm just gonna put it next to it because you never know i'm gonna put one on top of it as well i don't think you can detonate my c4 anyway but just shoot the armor box and just see what happens maybe get close to it as well i just want to see if it does any damage oh it does that was that was just the armor box yeah wow you can be killed by an armor box i don't think i knew that okay so i let go oh i heard something here comes in three two one let's have a look around see if it drops anywhere i swear i hear like a little thud i don't see anything so do you have an execution which like swings my character around yeah i think i think i should have it equipped where i yeah i'd like turn you around to face me it looks like let go i can hear it i'm gonna wait till later i'm gonna wait till you're chucking me over your shoulder here come in three two one click now oh oh it works that is so crazy [Music] oh god you were right that's that's nuts oh my god let me see this kill cam that's crazy it looks really dumb in the kill cam wow it's like you somehow do like a matrix move and like backflip me and take over my position it looks really weird on my killcam cool that's cool that's great all right i'm going for it let me out [Music] wow wow there's just a wall at the behind the smoke it's just a gray wall i just slowed myself down by doing that oh yeah [Music] that's weird it is [Music] feels good ah i was like one foot away go [Music] ah no it still goes oh it still gets ya yeah it does darn i timed it perfectly but ah can't get to the wall it was a good effort damn [Music] we're gonna finally do it we're gonna finally stop a train we already did that oh yeah you're right oh yeah yeah yeah you're right we did of course jesus slow down there bud what the did that destroy my shield oh i didn't even look all right [Music] okay [Music] oh nah it canceled it oh your shield is still here by the way oh it didn't destroy it no weird quick oh [Music] remind me [Music] and nice there you go yeah i kind of thought just something would go wrong if it's teleporting us you know [Music] get out of the way okay okay [Music] maybe leave it there it's like a stepping stone you know what i mean [Music] yeah actually it's not a bad idea yeah like you could ramp off this onto this and then with another truck oh no oh this is like some halo halo 2 stuff here yeah this is some jank my guy's just looking right out the window at the camera oh oh oh oh i think back out yes okay now there's a giant thing blocking my way there and that's unfair yeah i forgot about this thing um i think that might be the end also have you tried this uh second entry over here this little hole thing [Music] no there's like a sort of invisible wall over top of it is it okay yeah look i'm like hovering over top of it oh yeah actually i see oh clean oh that works that works i'm in oh yeah this i should get through this no problem [Music] oh no i think there's an invisible wall here you think so i think so oh oh oh oh never mind are you in not quite i am somewhat in though what the [Music] oh grab the grab the suv and ram me in get in there oh whoa get in i can't see anything either my camera's clipped into a wall get in oh my god what the hell was that yeah you can't get in there i promise you you cannot get in there [Music] hey guys joe here and thank you guys for watching thank you to raid shadow legends for sponsoring this video things are about to get very expensive for us this coming winter new consoles new gpus and a lot of new games coming out we just needed a little bit of help but uh i would rather not have to ever put adverts on my videos because they take a long time to make and i care about them having good flow and being professional and sleek so if you guys would like to support an ad free future for defend the house i'd really appreciate you guys just having a look at our patreon page and maybe considering uh supporting us over there if the ads don't bother you guys then no worries you know that is a future that we can continue down for defend the house it's just something that i would prefer not to do but hey i have ambitions with this channel and sometimes you got to do what you got to do speaking of patreon a big thank you to our newest pledges aki and adrian thank you guys really appreciate it i've got quite a few more warzone and modern warfare ideas in the bank and you know we have black ops not too far away so expect a bunch more call of duty content for the foreseeable future expect more halo from jameson but until then thank you for your support thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
