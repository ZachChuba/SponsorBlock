yo what's going on you guys so you guys showed a ton of support on the Gucci flip-flops Bay prank and I know you guys love the EZ Bay prank before he did I ever I'm gonna be putting an electric shock in the insole of the shoe and also super glue on top oh people will not be able to take their photo Joe Hall stuff or you are nasty [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello everyone and welcome back to a brand new GTA 5 funny moments compilation my name is Leon lush and I am bursting at the seams with gratitude that you would decide to spend a small portion of your day here with me now if you're on YouTube a lot like I am I know you're probably overwhelmed with just the sheer volume of exceptional content everywhere you look it's like incredible video high production value a meaningful message it's like we get it right can we just get some click baby [ __ ] nonsense that's like geared towards children that don't want to distinguish between what's good and bad what do I have to do to find some of that but you know life's not always fair so here we are but fear not and rejoice my brethren because I know it's hard to believe but after months of digging I was actually able to find some hot garbage on YouTube I know it sounds unreal but believe me it exists yeah so this is Joe Hall he has 1.3 million youtube and he makes a living basically just uploading these periodic bait pranks where he'll like putting powder on some trendy item get a couple million views and then go into hibernation for a couple of weeks and it's just these videos are really just national treasure so I'm excited for us to out turn our brains off together and really loosen our belts a little bit and enjoy the ride but before we indulge in what the hell's wrong with those shoes man now you got to respect Joe Hall for how he has just doubled down on the fake prank culture right he doesn't try to tiptoe around the issue trying to tow the line pretending like what he's doing is real he just makes the actors go extra hard to make it so ludicrous that instead of having the fakeness be some sort of detriment it becomes a commodity because it's just so ludicrous it becomes hilarious like that that is that is quality entertainment right there that is funny you got to give credit where it's due I just want to know how much he had to pay that guy to get him to jump into the bushes and scuff his arms all up though no this isn't the first and certainly won't be the last time I've talked about fake pranks on this channel they obviously exist there's a thriving ecosystem on YouTube I could care less sometimes I think it's kind of funny I'm just always enamored by the comments section how there's people that obviously get that it's fake and then there's always a demographic of people that will defend it to their dying breath because I guess they can't comprehend that maybe their favorite creators just you know making these elaborate skits in order to make a living off of like click baby thumbnails and they just somehow have a mic and you can hear them clearly you see the lucky chosen raises a good point here because the discerning viewer may raise the point well if he's the victim of this potential prank how can I hear perfect audio is if there's a lav mic underneath his shirt that's a good question but luckily if you tame alpha lassie is here to explain it you know what the mic is probably somewhere inside the shoes peach tough - are you that one you know I've spent a lot of years doing audio production and that is that is definitely what a hidden shoe mic sounds like I would have taken off with them not tried them on facepalm yes you and every other non paid actor so anyway is almost 5 million views on this one which is pretty impressive and you take a look at his channel and the uploads are pretty inconsistent but he's clearly got the thumbnail tidal combo down you know it's like every other every third video usually bangs you know 2.7 million hover board bait rank part - itching Gucci flip-flops bait prank 3.3 million views started off years ago doing like social experiments stuff like a lot of youtubers do and then once he stumbled into this bait prank routine it started doing really well for me kind of stuck to that formula if you look at this section of thumbnails it's all these bait pranks with like popular retail items and this electric shock stuff he's doing because you know if it works you got to keep doing it shocking me hey kid take all these shoes I mean this guy makes it pretty comfortable living making these videos and not even that often either you can't deny that YouTube is absolutely the land of opportunity right I mean [ __ ] I make a living doing this and I'm not really much different except I just don't make fake videos I just make fun of fake videos which isn't really much better to be honest but I mean most people would have to sink like 200 grand into a collegiate degree and then spend five to ten years in the real world getting work experience before ever approaching like a six-figure salary and then you have Joe Hall who's over here making one or two of these videos a month in probably easily clearance six figures every year it makes you want to it makes you think doesn't it if you're going to college because you're passionate and excited about a certain career path and you really want to grow up and educate yourself and be able to give back to the communities and the people around you that's incredibly commendable and I hope you continue down that path but if you're going to college just cuz your parents maybe expect you to and you're doing something you hate just because you know it's gonna make you X amount of dollars when you leave mine I suggest you save yourself $300,000 of student loan debt and just spend like 30 days studying YouTube and what you know thumbnail and title combinations work like on channels like Joe Hall here and then save up like a thousand bucks and invest in a camera and like a pair Easy's and make a couple of shitty ass videos every month that you know are gonna get clicks and you're on your way to six figures annually doing basically nothing I'm not suggesting we need more content like this on the contrary but I'm just trying to point out opportunities where opportunities lie when somebody picks up a phone you try to steal it they're not really looking at how clean the phone is they just see an iPhone X put it in the pocket real good there they don't really pay attention to the details put it all on the back on the camera on the charging core it's like everywhere I make sure like I flood the freaky flaws as the efficacy of these electric shock bait prank starts to die down about a year ago he takes a leap of faith into the realm of itching powder bait pranks and it really revitalizes the channel and carries him through this last year up until current day where he's still uploading these incredible in fact this Apple earpods bait prank which is how I found this channel just the other day let's take a peek in this video I'm going to be dropping Apple earpods it's burning people with itching powder on does anybody in the right mind decides to pick up the air pods and put them on they're literally gonna be going nuts no I by the way I think it's funny to point out he's been using the exact same three or four meme cutaways for like the past three or four years just sticking to his guns I love the commitment nice to mix things works I'm gonna run up to them and tell them that I have an infection that can never be an infection that can't be cured bro there's pranks and then there's just being straight cruel you see I love this right here this is how you adapt and grow as a youtuber when you get criticism he's probably gotten so much [ __ ] in the comments about how the people he's allegedly pranking sound like they have a lav mic on he just puts like a two or three second subtext here that says microphone hidden prior well there you have folks there's a microphone hidden on the prank subject under a shirt prior it's so loose lay off you think your car [Music] oh yeah you know my man could not believe there's Apple air pods inside of that Apple air pod case okay yeah just believe your Apple earpods here I'm gonna pick them up maybe leave a listen to some music you let's go to six sync let's go get these things off and they're Wireless to me Virginia boy that's how we okay and another mean cut the same place for music before oh yeah oh yeah oh man this man is dude it was at this moment that evening Keith oh god I can't take it the cut away yeah go here we go the itching powder is kicking in music you got it still dancing through the pain dad what's going on here god damnit Oh Williams really feeling it back now I'm gonna call him William oh oh oh no all the itching powders really taking its toll huh we're going into the fourth quarter here and William is running he's down on one knee up Oh dolphin sound effects to cover the squares folks we want to keep this monetized ad nice he is keeping the airpot in does not even care he has to listen to that Drake folks he is now supine on the pavement no oh there is oh my god oh my god they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine blood starts to come just coming out of here that night and the Oscar goes to the ha ha ha the homeless man Apple earpods bait prank it's tough to criticize this guy honestly because it's so blatant that it really kind of falls under the so bad it's good category you know like I'm be I'm entertained right now I'll be honest it's like watching sharknado or some d-list movie that's just so terrible it gets like this cult following because people want to watch it for how bad it is once I got good ass well I must admit Johal may be my new secret closeted guilty-pleasure I mean just something succulent to sink my oh it's so bad it's good teeth into why are they so verbal about everything wouldn't you just pick him up quietly and walk away coy King shut up no that wouldn't be entertaining at all why could we make a video of people just stealing things normally that would make no sense you can tell II paid them here I love this channel this is one of the few things it actually makes me laugh well Kyra white wolf that sounds like a pretty tough existence I'm sorry well kids the moral the story is this unless your heart is dead set on doing some corporate [ __ ] for the rest of your life that's gonna make you mediocre wages with a massive upfront financial investment into a for-profit education system just throw those college applications in the trash and spend a couple of days study in the Joe Hall YouTube channel because you'll be making more money in the next six months then you would have made in the first 10 years out of college and let me tell you there might be a little bit of a shaky future in this route but you'll be able to buy some Gucci some Gucci [ __ ] in the short-term so you know it's pretty useless in the grand scheme of things but it might get you laid so so huh there's that now I'm kidding please stay in school and contribute something to society I certainly haven't and we need more good people that aren't youtubers in this world I think thank you so much for watching if you're new here would mean the world if you'd subscribe thank you to today's sponsor of Rage Shadow legends link in the description and one last favor if you could before you go just grab yourself a big mixing bowl and just pour yourself a huge bowls here it can be any cereal you want probably your favorite Cinnamon Toast Crunch Lucky Charms checks whatever just it needs to be like a large bowl almost like a whole box of cereal that should be able to fit into this bowl instead of and then instead of pouring milk like maybe you normally would with cereal just take an entire canister of itching powder pour that right on top and then go ahead and continue to ingest the entire thing in the second it feels like your large intestine is on fire and is about to fall out of your butthole you just want to dig down deep and take all the energy you have left and just hip throw that [ __ ] like button for me I do appreciate you all so I apologize Nigel wasn't in this video really but and I really don't care because he's a piece of [ __ ] piece [Music]
