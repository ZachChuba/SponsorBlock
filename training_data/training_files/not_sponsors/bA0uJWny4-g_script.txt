so I was looking through the 3dmark leaderboards the other day because Steve over at gamers Nexus was talking some smack about our benchmarking skills I didn't see it though I don't watch his videos as usual kingpin from EVGA is way up at the top holding the record in 3dmark times by extreme and all that stuff but when I looked a little closer I saw what's this he's only using a 79 80 XC 18 core processor with 4 gtx 1080i crapha cards I thought this is my opportunity my one shot my mom's sphaghetti I can't beat him with liquid nitrogen cooling and like sawed off graphics cards with custom power delivery boards soldered to the back of them but what I do have is better hardware than that so my plan is to use 56 CPU cores in our ACC 621 Issei GWS and for four of Nvidia squad Rho GV 100s which cost a whopping nine thousand dollars each and today's video is brought to you by thermal take thermal takes level 20 cases feature radiator mounting for water cooling gaming focused aesthetics and beautiful tempered glass panels check them out at the link in the video description are you not entertained I'm gonna throw in a quick spoiler alert here my dastardly plan to troll you guys with this setup didn't work out but it's still worth going through the process because it is a pretty unreal rig so problem number one SLI support for gaming on Quadros the GV 100 with its high speed HBM to memory and massive 5,000 376 cuda cores should be a little faster than a Titan V which is faster than a gtx 980ti or titan XP right out of the box so even though I can't liquid-nitrogen cool these things I should be able to make up a lot of the difference in just outright faster hardware except for one problem these cards don't support 3-way or four-way SLI so this right here is called an env link connector and it is only designed for these cards anyway to put two of them together at a time so while you can actually run SLI over any link it's not really intended for that it's more for resource and memory sharing and 3d modeling or compute applications fortunately though I do have a way around that so this is a Quadro sync to board and you'll probably recognize it if you've watched one of our many k like 16k a gaming videos where we've used it to game on an array of as many as 16 monitors at once now this thing's purpose is primarily video display walls like giant digital signage deployments for example to keep the monitors from getting out of sync which would cause weird tearing issues but we already know that it works for gaming as long as the resolution we're running at isn't too much for the frame buffer of each individual card so that got me thinking what if instead of plugging multiple monitors into each one of the cards because remember the more pixels each card drives the harder it is for you to run the game what if instead of that we just ran a single 1080p display out of each one in a 2x2 grid for a total of 4k well these are each 32 gig cards so should be just fine bringing us to problem number two even if you had a monitor like this one it's 1080p it's got super thin bezels it's inexpensive you still have a problem nobody wants to game where 4 bezels intersect because that's great where your crosshair is this was by far my favorite part of my idea for this video and what prompted me to go ahead with it now I had intended like I said to troll you guys with some unbelievable benchmarks with like a test bench under a sheet or something to make you guys think that I had RTX cards early or something but you'd never buy that if I had 4 of these monitors on an arm like we did back when we did our first 8k gaming setup so what if we used LG's 43 UD 79 it's 43 inches 4k and thanks to its four separate inputs it could be split into quadrants so let's get it set up shall we one thing I should do while we're setting this up is give a massive shout-out to Benny over at MX who did a personal favour hooking me up very last minute with one of these guys actually two of them DisplayPort to HDMI 2.0 active adapters the active parts important because well for one thing these Quadros don't have HDMI so you have to run DisplayPort and we've only got two DisplayPort inputs on this monitor only one of which is actually usable because it's a Type C and you can't adapt this to that there are cables but they are directional cables they don't go both ways the Quadro sync 2 card here only if every one of these cards is hooked up to the same type of display the card has to think it's DisplayPort so that's why the active signal adapter is important in every card thinks it's hooked up to DisplayPort just the amount of like hassle that I went through you get this thing working no but it was totally worth it sort of here's an example of one of those directional cables they only go from a type C output like on your laptop or something to a display port monitor they don't go the other way it totally makes sense it's just not something that I thought about when this video was in the early conceptualization stages can we all just stop and appreciate for a moment that this is 36,000 dollars worth of graphics cards here I guess no props to Nvidia for lending in to us even though we're totally not doing what we said we were going to do with them Nvidia gets real cagey about gaming on Quadros they just I don't like people talking about it okay so HDMI for HDMI boom boom done finish and you can see how seamless it is as you move between them so you'll get a little bit of tearing we got a little bit vertically there generally actually that's probably not the worst I've seen but then you can see here moving between these two we get nothing oh and now you see it's being oh you know so it's not perfect but I figured it would be good enough to trick you guys bring up some 3d mark here and there it is time spy extreme I think this would have been believable [Music] hey you can see the characters walking right through the intersection of all four of them and you can't see any pairing and yeah so that's pretty underwhelming but perhaps if we weren't so CPU bottleneck so while our CPU score is actually really good like 10,000 that's just because we got a great score in the CPU tests not because that CPU is actually not causing a bottleneck for our overpowered graphic setups so maybe what we can do is transfer the whole thing onto a bench with a 79 80 XE so let me do that maybe we can alleviate the CPU bottleneck a little bit because we've got lots of cores here but they're not particularly fast you know you do enough bench swaps you get pretty fast at it and has expected this is really not a lot better also I'm having another weird issue where the color is a little bit off on the bottom left quadrant for some reason I've actually run this before on both of these setups I have no idea what it's doing this time as you guys can imagine by this point in this whole process I was feeling pretty discouraged because we are a far cry from the results that I was expecting I mean it's not like the entire thing is terrible like here we can we can fire up a game here and see that actually like in game performance looks pretty darn good and we're just gonna ignore this weirdness because this is the first time I've seen that but this is not the benchmark breaker that I was really hoping that it would be oh I know what it is it's the whole 0 to 255 versus 16 to whatever black debt thing how do you adjust that you know what I bet I have to break down the mosaic you can see not in mosaic I'm not having the issue so I think it's just a matter of like it just went wonk Oh for a second there yeah see it works perfectly this time so let's run a game or two on this thing so what I can hope for here is that we will get some pretty awesome frame rates in GTA 5 why is this game so bad at running in full-screen hey Anthony can i bar you for a minute no I don't want it like it can I just change more things then one at a time like okay how do you how do you crank it so the good news is throughout the process of getting all of our GTA 5 settings cranked this tearing line down the middle is gone so that's pretty cool now we can see if our 4k performance is impressive because we have got this thing dialed in to hurt anything other than a godly graphics card setup why is that off did it even oh it did it registered everything else just not the MSA so that's neat multiple reboots later we've got all that on yes I want to keep the new settings yes yes yes and then we should be able to do extended shadow distances now now let's find out if in a situation where we're not quite so CPU bottlenecked this thing can knock our socks off Anthony are you ready yeah are you ready are you ready I'm ready so what would you expect do you think so that's that stuttering its suffering so I still maintain this was a pretty cool idea perhaps works in gta5 dx11 yeah let's just let's just throw it on here okay so how impressed are you for $36,000 all right let's see what it's actually running out here yeah no no it's just we're only running it like 30 FPS okay what does a Peltzer v8 something are they Oh 15 fps oh okay well I mean that was clearly the framerate drops this is very realistic car physics we've got going on here I'm saying that they probably wanted this car in their pool and I'm doing them a favor so basically between the amount of GPU horsepower we have and the difficulty of synchronizing them and managing resources between them there are many many bottlenecks that prevent this theoretically cool setup from actually performing well in the real world it's link in the video description thanks for watching guys if you just liked this video you can hit that
