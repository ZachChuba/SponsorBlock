hello insert catchphrase here I don't know if I'm doing that still or not but I'm just saying it in case as you can see by the title of this video I'm going to be reacting to dream capture I kind of want to do three videos but I don't think I can do it timewise I'm definitely looking at scream and you and I I don't know too much about dreamcatcher I know beauty and I know you and I as a song I also know the PA video and I love Beauty out of that song and I love the video if your first few times I watch it I didn't like it very much because I was like this all over the place but I think I understand that dreamcatcher is kind of a dark / girl group also telling by the song it's like more rock and stuff so I'm very I'm just really interested to see what their other videos look like I haven't heard this song scream I haven't seen the video I haven't seen any screenshots so I have no idea what to expect you I'm expecting it to be extreme if that makes sense I don't stand dreamcatcher so I don't have a bias or anything but when I watched a deja vu video I really like Gio and then I watched PT and I really liked oh god what's her name you're John no you're oh I don't know her name but I like those two I don't know if I can recognize them I think of the song the video has subtitles so maybe they put the names in front of the words that would be great but I think that's all I have to say I don't know if I said everything because I'm kind of doing this I'm trying to do my videos a little faster than trying to say everything five times just so I don't forget anything I know what I forgot I hopefully you feel like it and subscribe please it would be great also I adjusted my computer height so I'm hoping that you can see my eyes now as I react because you couldn't do that before and that's kind of not the point of a reaction but I'm realizing right now that I'm still looking like this way so sorry if you can't see my face properly I'm figuring it out still plus as you can tell I don't have a desk so it's just a whole mess let's watch us I'm excited I don't know what to expect the title scares me a little bit oh wait I'm not reading hold up sorry I need to pause this I hate reading one day suddenly the light did not come people forgot how to say good things [Music] my god I love her hair that's her [Music] but your favourites in the front [Music] Oh Aaron's videos always feel like movies I love their videos the aesthetic that they have lost you again woman - okay Oh life [Music] I've heard that part before I've heard the please I don't want to scream and then the first bass drum [Music] Jedrek awesome I loved on this part in the court and of course I can't read and look at their things at the same time [Music] I like the song a lot you start she said sorry [Music] I love this part [Music] nobody [Music] [Music] visual attack [Music] so cool [Music] they're also pretty excuse me [Music] Green to be continued alright oh damn dreamcatcher is are awesome I love this song I have actually heard the make me want to scream and then the like dubstep bass drop part before but I have never heard the devil's eyes come or whatever they're saying part before so I've only heard that that short snippet but oh my god that that part specifically so cool that makes me feel like a badass it's  awesome honestly I really really really really like the dreamcatcher music videos they are very fabricated usually Beauty it's not like that beauty is more shot on location but this one feels very like with a lot of screen screen because of the tree scenario but I always feel like I'm watching a movie when I watch a dreamcatcher video which is cool especially because our music kind of doesn't go with that idea like the music is so like hardcore dubstep I don't even know how to describe the music but when I think of that you would think like you wouldn't imagine that there's like a whole movie going on the music video but there is also there also beautiful I struggling and I would see on who like attacked me with her visuals I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right as always this right here like chill my friend oh my god but I think I really like you I don't know how to pronounce her name I need to see how it's spelled in ojio is the leader oh I like her she's a Taurus girl girl girl girl girl lead vocalist lead dancer and visual visual that's damn right she on she and obviously as I as Prince she like she in green I'm learning I'm like I've been learning Korean for a while but I keep like slacking off and not continuing but I know how to read Hangul so I mean no you hyun-jung [Music] you hola you know me even her name is um I like her nice I'm getting distracted oh my god she's so pretty I haven't said anything technical about the video I love this whole shop I like I love the lighting on her I love her haircut I love her styling I love her makeup I love how she holds her hands the purple in the background is awesome it's just wow this I have to say out of all of the sets yours are pretty this set I don't really like this set a lot the set is not the right word um like for example I love those columns in the back here you can see the lights and it just looks like you can see like the backdrop it looks this scene takes me out of the whole illusion of this being like a movie like a real movie this set looks this set looks kind of like a stage naughty okay that they could be performing on in like live I don't see why they did it this way for music video doesn't fit with the rest of the video because although the rest it's just like so immersive and you feel like you're like in this dream world or something and then this kind of takes me out this is all again as always it's all personal opinions doesn't mean that this this is bad or that you shouldn't like it or something just it's just my perspective I don't know if there I'm sure there is like a story in this video but as usual I would have to spend a lot of time with this video to figure out the story so I'm not gonna try and like get into that now also I'm watching another video so I don't want to spend too much time on this right now which I already have this is super green screen but I don't mind at all it also reminds me a little bit of Sailor Mars and say Lamaze is awesome so there's like a lot of transitions going on here like a lot of editing this is very green screen again but it's like see like that's what I mean they used so many green screens and I'm just wondering why they couldn't have done that in this setup to make it look a little more immersive like for example this is a great job like for example this looks obviously you can still tell that there's like a screen at the end of it but it's still like if you pause it you could believe that they actually shot this at the location like it's so it's so well setup and there's like dimensions to it and it goes really far back all of those things this might be the same set because I see the columns there but it's like a different angle on it or something but this looks so great and the other one doesn't I don't know what it is I don't know maybe I'm just being super a picky for no reason like what is this like triangle thingy in the back I don't know I don't know also there's like a lot of aspect changes aspect ratio changes which I don't know if there have a purpose or if it's just like meant to look interesting anyways let's move on from this I don't want to spend too much time on it cuz I want to watch the other one and I've already spent 23 minutes talking for you it's not gonna be 23 minutes but for me it is I like this video a lot it's really cool I really like how dreamcatcher manages to make their movies I say movies but to make their music videos look like movies or feel like movies I always feel like I'm watching like a whole a whole short film with just awesome I like that a lot I don't think I said a lot of technical things about that's about the supreme video I'm just mostly talking about things that immediately stand out to me because if I want to take closer look I just need to spend a little more time than I have in one of these reaction videos you know let's watch you and I which again I've heard the song before based on the supreme video still don't know what he expect I feel like they have this theme of like imaginative worlds and creating I don't know my god their music readers are just so cool there's so much work put into days like and shows so much thought okay I'm just gonna watch this I don't know what to expect other than a movie which is gonna be awesome so oh I forgot I knew this already [Music] oh wait where my remember oh there's no subtitles no I don't know who's singing [Music] [Music] that's the one I like right that I can't pronounce a name young [Music] I haven't talked about that choreography at all my god just such cool her [Music] the video is slower than I thought it would be based on the song their sets are insane they always have this like one stage that's very real that they dancing [Music] [Music] my god she's so cool well I think I like our lot [Music] so there's something going on its fighters [Music] I love her hair her [Music] she's so cool oh my god [Music] hmm so early for those things you guys [Music] can you turn us off with annotations no that's a little early your like in the video come on okay I think yo hyung you Yin if I pronounced your name right no you're not could potentially be my bias if I ever stand dream catcher I was talking about her the whole time she is cool I love her hair in every video she's also super pretty I know she was the one with purple hair in the other video but I liked her hair there too they're all really good dancers I should pay any watch up like dance practice I mean again this is again a whole damn movie and I love it dream capture are awesome I want to know I know PD I know who directed BD because I made a video well I'm working on a video where I'm comparing two music videos and one of them was directed by the guy who also directed PD but I don't know who it is also I don't know if he directed these two they have very similar for I needed some water it's like because you can't see what's going on under their table so it's really no point in me dressing up everything if you can't see it it's another filmmaking thing if you can't see it it's not there as I was saying I always kind of follow the same structure of setting up a magical world in the first shot they always these two videos that I watched so they start on like a very CGI green screen like environment that's like established after us the magical element of the whole video and then having the stage in which they dance which is a real practical set there's not really a lot of green screen or anything going on and then they have like these individual shots which are like in the kind of in the dream world ish here we have a story going on with that spider and like the demon hand thing but as always if I want to figure that out I would need to take more time I think I saw the tripod with a camera at some point in this dancing shot there it is this is not in other shots oh I see I also don't really see I don't know if that's like a prop or if it's because there we never have an angle from there so it wouldn't really make sense if that was a real camera so I'm thinking it's a prop but it also disappears at some point so here not there and then you cut from here and now it's here again I don't know what that is like it could be a thing like this I know maybe that was a mistake or something I mean it must have been a mistake or maybe it's a prop and they use it at some point and I missed it this shot is really cool like it's it's always it's always a cool thing to like in horror movies you don't ever want to reveal the bad thing or like the the the antagonist or the creepy thing too early because it kind of takes away from the anticipation and like the the mystery which makes it so thrilling so this is really cool like to show it as a shadow obviously also it usually saves budget because you don't have to like go crazy with CGI to make the woman turned to a spider you could just do it in it as a shadow which is much easier like this is a smart way to first of all have a mystery going on but then also be smart about budget but then also make it look really cool and interesting I like this set a lot this is a really cool set I'm guessing it's supposed to be like a full house like every room like I can see the room where the woman was sitting I think is it the one in the back I like the concept of this video also I haven't said that I like this concept a lot because I can see it tying together with a spider and the spider webs and like it kind of feels like a doll house also because the girl that was like in the corner there were like pins but they were ginormous so it makes me feel like they are dolls also would make sense with the spider being super big because if they're dolls they would be small so there's something going on with spiders and like dolls them being dolls and then also this dream let the fantasy world aspect of it and then this smoke thingy which makes me think position I don't know anyway there's a lot going on I like it a lot this one felt really short even though I feel like this one has a clearer story than the other one I prefer this green video I don't really know why maybe it's just the colors or the aesthetic of it I don't know I'm not sure the lighting I think it might be the lighting I really there's a lot of different sets but this shot is so pretty this shot too and again like I like the effects of like though sparks flying or the snow all of that it looks more together as the Uni video but I like both of them I also like both songs and I like dreamcatcher and I think if I ever stand them Yohan Yu Yin would be my bias and you may be my bias record and that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned something or you saw something that you did before as always maybe that is my outro catchphrase because I truly mean that I'm really hoping that when you watch one of my videos you coming out saying oh my god I've never noticed that there's this weird camera prop standing in this video even if that doesn't mean and you can't do anything with that knowledge but you learn something new let me know if you all see I always forget to say this I forgot to say this in the monsta x video that i just filmed before this please leave in the comments other groups or maybe dream catcher songs or any kind of song or music video that you want me to react to or take a closer look at i would be very happy to do that as always please leave a like if you like this video and subscribe if you want to see more of my videos and as always thank you again again and again and again for watching and bye I still hate saying bye to the camera but I have to do it because that's what people do [Music]
