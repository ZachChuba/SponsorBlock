Elias house using the B memoirs book making our future return trip to zaiah a lot faster however that requires getting us to and we don't have the requisite cooking level to be able to make it right now note that although the wiki says or used to say until I edited it after recording this that you can buy us do at the pub what's of the docks for 25 coins this is wrong you can only buy the Stu on twisted lyrics so we'll have to wait until finishing Gertrude's can which rewards us to or visiting Sears blunt the purchase one in order to come back and replace sail back to Port Sarim and head to the food store to buy six months of flour for cooks assistant sea slug and in case we bring the red berry pie for the nights or you can also buy some red berries to make the pie however the easily obtainable for free south of our mark later on it'll just require some world campaigner for this run since I forgot to do it earlier buy some sardines for gherkins cat as well as to feed the kid and we received from the quest after that head north to the farm grab leaves one bucket from outside the front door then go to the chicken pen to the west pick up the native cooks assistant go out the back door to the cow farm fill your buckets with milk from the dairy cow then kill two calves for their meat one for juridic ritual and one for witch's potion if you have any spare inventory spaces people clones for Demon Slayer as well head southeast to dream are either on the way or after banking depending on how full your inventory is pick up a piece of cheese and Aggies house for witches house after then a lot a few kicks and head over to the rooftop agility course we only need to get 25 agility for the green tree but the hard line long shortcut is very handy in a parcel 33 the grand tree itself just 7900 experience so if we do the rooftop agility course until 10,000 347 experience finishing that quest will bump us up to exactly 33 once that's done pull out all mine inheritance the pickaxe The Chronicle in the pirate's treasure key home teleport to Lumbridge to grab 30 more sensitive starter rooms before using the chronicle teleport to the champions guild 9 10 until it will 15 lighten to be able to mine iron ore for dorrance quest before leaving mind 7 clay 6 for dorks quest and 1 to later turn into soft clay to craft into a bowl for a diary tales run east past the dark wizards to the other Mayan and line to iron horn for copper or fedoras quest as well as 1 extra copper ore to latest meld into a bronze bar for the observatory quest will get the tin ore leader go back west and pick one Kodama berry for Romeo and Juliet and enough red berries to make a few pies for the night sword in case you burn one too as well as for making the red die for a ghost of light later on you'll have to open top a few times Hill West pass the Wizards again then north into town start Shilov er up I talking to Charlie then go west and talk to Catrin to join the black arm game head back toward the bar and get the stake from dr.
