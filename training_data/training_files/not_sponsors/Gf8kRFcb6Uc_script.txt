this episode is brought to you by curiosity stream during the Napoleonic Wars the Portuguese monarchy under John the 6th fled to Brazil and set up court they're leaving Portugal largely under control of the British who were fighting the French at the time and after the wars he remained in Brazil effectively turning Portugal into a colony of Brazil so the Liberals and Portugal formed a Cortes and rebelled in 1820 the force turn to return and signed a new constitution leaving his eldest son Pedro to govern over Brazil but as the Cortes tried to limit Pedro's powers in Brazil he declared Brazil's independence plus John's wife Carlota of Spain and his younger son Miguel were vehemently opposed to the Constitution and liberalism and in 1823 Miguel rose up forcing his father to renounce the Constitution Miguel again rose up in 1824 but this failed and he was exiled then John died in 1826 and this caused a succession crisis as Miguel claimed Pedro hub forfeited his claims in the Portuguese crown by declaring independence for Brazil Pedro not interested in the Portuguese crown for himself abdicated it in favor of his young daughter maria ii and appointed his sister Isabel Maria as her regent but to appease Miguel Pedro arranged that Maria would marry him but in 1827 Isabel Maria became ill so Miguel returned from exile to be the new regent however he became dismissing many liberal officers and filled the ministry positions with his allies and was declared king the liberal soldiers and urban centers unsuccessfully rose up in May and many fled the country as Miguel began targeting any opposition but under the Duke of Terceira the Liberals seized the Azores and it remained the only territory still loyal to Maria Spain under the authoritarian Ferdinand the seventh the United States and the papacy all recognized Miguel as king Bert Britain and France were hostile to him meanwhile in Brazil Pedro had fought the Argentinians and Christian independence movement but struggled to find a favorable balance between liberalism and conservatism then in 1831 radical Brazilians attacked Portuguese in the night of bottles and as protests against him spread he abdicated in favor of his son and set sail for Europe while in Portugal Miguel began arresting foreigners for allegedly inciting revolt Louie Filippo France demanded they be released but this was refused so in May a French fleet was sent to Lisbon and to break the blockade of the Azores Miguel however still refused to meet French demands so more friendships arrived in late June and after defeating the Portuguese Navy bombarded the belem tower in July Miguel finally relented and Pedro who had been in Britain and France left for the Azores he gathered an army of liberals and foreign mercenaries in London in portal unopposed in July 1832 but they were quickly besieged by Miguel's far larger army for a year so to change the course of the war Pedro hired a british admiral charles napier to lead his fleet and transport in half of his men to the Algarve in the south from there they beat Miguel small forces in the South moved north and captured Lisbon while Napier defeated Miguel's fleets in July 1833 Miguel tried to move his army south from Portal to take Lisbon but his assault in August was unsuccessful and he suffered heavy casualties this allowed Pedro's forces to break through in October and push them East however months long stalemate ensued meanwhile in Spain Ferdinand the 7th died but he had changed the law so his daughter Isabel was made Queen she had the support of the Liberals but her conservative uncle Carlos who was in Portugal claimed the throne starting the first Carlos war Miguel refused to hand him over to the Spanish so the Spanish liberals formed an alliance with Pedro and began sending troops into Portugal to capture Carlos then as all of Iberia was embroiled in a struggle between absolutism and constitutionalism Britain and France signed the quadruple alliance with the liberal rulers in Portugal and Spain so the Liberals went on the offensive and took Braga in April 1834 and defeated Miguel in battle in May although Miguel still had a large army his generals convinced him to surrender fearing further foreign intervention Miguel was exiled once again and the young Maria was recognized as queen this the Celts blood iron and sacrifice which I highly recommend
