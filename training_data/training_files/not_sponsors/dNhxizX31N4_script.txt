polyphonic or text polyphonic to 500 500 to get started today there's a shortage of true halloween songs of course we've got the monster mash and then there's songs from halloween movies like the nightmare before christmas and rocky horror picture show and the horror movie aesthetic of michael jackson's thriller means it's he's frequent play on all hallows but all these songs lean more towards the campsite of halloween and less towards the horror and that's why my personal favorite halloween song is probably i put a spell on you by screaming j hawkins i put a spell on you is a song that has a healthy dose of camp as all good halloween songs should but it also taps into the other side of the season its lyrics conjure images of the occult and there's something about screaming j hawkins vocal performance that can rattle you to your core this has led to the song being covered by dozens of artists and cracking its way onto countless halloween playlists more than just that though i put a spell on you completely redefined hawkins career and birthed an entire new sub-genre of music let's take a closer look [Music] in 1956 screaming j hawkins was just jay hawkins an up-and-coming blues [Music] [Laughter] [Music] he had released a few traditional blue singles over the last three years and was in the studio once more looking for his next single he had a song in mind a piece he had written alongside herb slotkin called i put a spell on you hawkins envisioned the song as a slow ballad refined and beautiful perhaps the kind of song that annie lennox turned it into with her 2014 cups you can hear remnants of this early idea in an unissued cut of the song from that 1956 session i put a spell on you and perhaps that mellower version would have stayed the final cut but fortunately for us things got rowdy in the studio producer arnold maxson brought in beers and meat for the musicians and turned the session into a party in the midst of this party screaming j hawkins ripped out a different take on the song this version was wild and roaring instead of being driven by piano the song was built around raspy saxophones and an even raspier voice in his drunken state hawkins punctuated the song with demonic laughter and spooky ad-libs the refined blues ballad that hawkins had imagined was lost to the wind replaced with something else something raw something visceral it was born out of pure drunken inspiration so much so that hawkins didn't even remember recording the song that would change his career forever but before we go any further it's worth pulling back and looking at where music was in 1956 it was only a few years earlier that rhythm and blues had begun to coalesce into a new genre called rock and roll and in 1956 this genre was starting to cross over from black audiences to white audiences bill haley and his comments had released rock around the bock a year earlier and elvis presley kicked off 56 with the iconic heartbreak hotel this new genre was causing moral panics due to its raw sexual nature and the shifting lifestyle that it represented and if this don't be cruel to who heart is true who's causing controversy you can only imagine the reaction but it incited an uproar amongst the rest of society several radio stations banned the song claiming it sounded cannibalistic of course banning a song is a great way to stir up some interest so while the bands prevented i put a spell on you from charting well they turned it into a cult phenomenon and one day a radio dj named alan fried had this cult phenomenon come across his desk freed was a giant figure in the early days of rock and roll he helped give the genre legs delivering it nightly to a thirsty generation of teenagers he even helped popularize the use of the term rock and roll to describe the genre freed loved hawkensong and invited him onto a christmas special but fried had more than just taste in music he had a keen sense of theatrics and he knew that hawkins dramatic demonic song would lend itself well to theatrics so he offered hawkins three hundred dollars around twenty eight hundred dollars in today's money to begin his performance by popping out of a coffin hawkins took the money and a legacy was born coming out of a coffin to begin a rock show seems like old hat now but keep in mind that in the 1950s most performers wore quaffed hair and matching suits on stage anecdotes even have one audience member running away in fright when hawkins began his performance it was a roaring success and a moment that forever changed music history in the coming months hawkins would develop this horror-inspired image further creating an entire persona around the song he got a prop skull that he named henry put tusks into his nose and started performing with a rubber snake it was bizarre and soaked in horror imagery borrowing aesthetics from the growing film genre but hawkins wasn't pure horror he also leaned into the comedic aspects of his performance as well with exaggerated facial expressions and body movements it even led to some calling hawkins the black vincent price in reference to the iconic film star hawkins performances laid the groundwork for all kinds of rock and roll in the coming decades smoke machines stage props and even elaborate costumes all became key parts of rock shows particularly shock rock you can trace the lineage of alice cooper marilyn manson and gwar directly back to screaming jay and just as hawkins performance has had reverberations through music history so too has his music nine years after hawkins released his original version nina simone would cover the song her version pulled the camp away and delivered the song with haunting sincerity and i don't care if you don't want me i'm yours right now it's a darkly romantic piece of music carried by one of only a few singers who have the same vocal power as hawkins simone's version became a minor hit for her peaking at number 23 on billboard's r b chart and that kicked off a series of covers over the next few years the allen price set had a top 10 uk hit with their own version of the song another romantic take and then credence clearwater revival took it on in 1968 bringing some of the darkness and grit back into the song that same year it was covered by shock rock pioneers the crazy world of arthur brown and from there it entered the popular canon with tons of artists giving their own take including one of the all-time shock rock greats in marilyn manson who covered the song in 1995. the notorious b.i.g even sampled hawkins original version of the song on his 1997 track kick in the door i put a spell on you has become a key piece of music history it's been used as a romantic love ballad it's been used as a raw sexual song and it's been used as a jarring shock rock performance but perhaps most of all it's been used as the cornerstone of any great halloween playlist thank you so much and have a happy halloween you
