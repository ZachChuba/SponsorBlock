good damage yo did anyone else damage him or did I do that Cerberus plus one Cerberus plus one the epitome of deadly the Cerberus plus one is an auto rifle with one two three or barrels and I've used it in a video before but now I have something special the exotic catalyst now the exotic catalyst is interesting hold r2 swap to a tighter closer range spread now I don't know about you guys but the range on this thing isn't that great so now we're gonna reduce it even further and see what the hell happens okay are we gonna kill everyone are we gonna we're gonna murder everyone in our sight let's find out today at eleven I really don't know what to think about this like I haven't used it yet so I can't I can't really picture what is it gonna be like I just finished the catalyst I haven't killed anyone with it yet I think of it yeah I'm a zero kills does it show does it show the Vanguard ones because I had a had to get a whole bunch of kills I guess it only shows up after you get the catalyst so so this is normal you shoot the target you can see the spread on it and then this is oh oh wow look at this spread it's way smaller okay I mean more shots are gonna hit let's bring it hey recluses nuts that's okay we got we just pushed into a powered-up recluse so I think we gotta charge you up every time focus fire I'm excite furnace I'm excited I feel like I'm doing a murder way back um wait five damage five damage how close range is it I was doing five damage from this far away what the [ __ ] hold on that can't be right there's no way get the hell out of your Microsoft idiot it does it's five damage whoa wait wait wait wait come on it's dude five damage boys it's do it five damage how close do you have to be this is it's like a to tap it took a two or three tap okay here's my issue though here's my issue if I'm going and barrel stuffing someone with this know if I'm going in Barrow stubbing zone with this they can just shotgun me like the range is like this far it gets like in shotgun range why would you use this now III suppose like I guess you could use this for PvE and maybe it'd be a nuts I knew I was gonna die there I just did it anyways I just wanted to get it over with in PvP there is no way this is a good weapon yo did anyone else dammit Jim or did I do that ok so it's like it took a it's like a toots it took it may be a to tap this is really interesting ok ok I've got I gotta test this in PvE now I just I gotta see it I gotta see what what is your issue close your eyes can I just came in and she's going it's in that it's in my bathroom underneath the alright we're gonna we're gonna go jump over to Canton like is this ass is it good is it like when would you use this I don't even I don't even know what to say like I don't eat I don't know what to do I feel like I'm being Punk'd like I feel like I'm on Punk'd and Ashton Kutcher is gonna pop on big pump [ __ ] like what is going on in this exotic so we got our regular like fast fire right and then we've got and then we've got the last one and like I like it's it's it's way less spread what is way less rate and if you're in such a low range do you care about the spread and it like it shoots slower too I gotta see the damage on this I gotta see the damage so we're gonna we're gonna pop it off in here we're gonna pop it on in here we're going to go into this lost sector we're gonna start nailing some idiots with it and see what happens alright we need the same enemies Oh acolyte okay 300 some damage and now let's try to try the same thing on this guy I mean I I guess I I don't know what to think here okay in the mid-range in the mid to mid to long range its ass it's absolutely ass but you might as well just use the Cerberus like regular okay we're gonna kill the boss zone a second we're gonna test this and then in just a minute your boys okay so we're gonna we're gonna lay into the boss here for one clip okay so we did almost a third of his health now we're gonna do one more clip like this about about about this look at the damage wait a second is this real life right I feel like that hit really hard hold on I feel like I was missing shot so I gotta test this again okay I'm gonna run in and do it again boys I just thought of when this would be sick so um there's overload enemies there's like the barrier enemies and the unstoppable enemies the overload enemies and when you shoot them with the rounds its stuns them and locks them in place you could stun them and then and then just stretch this and just close range right hold on I gotta see this again I gotta I gotta dive in here again and I wanna I want to see how powerful this is okay mint like mid to long ranges are like even out this range you're starting to have some issues with damage but close up get the hell out of here I mean right now I have unstable essence okay do you know what maybe that skewed the information maybe that skewed thing so I'm gonna make sure I don't I don't have the essence when I fight the boss so we're gonna do the same thing again okay we're gonna do the same thing again no focus fire from about this range one clip okay now the same range of belt about this range I mean it's for sure hitting harder like it's for sure hitting harder how good is that deep yes though I mean it's the thing is it's a primary weapon like it's a it's a kinetic weapon okay let's just use like let's just use the nightshade let's use the entire magazine of a nightshade I'm gonna start it up again we're gonna fight it with the nightshade and just get an idea of how much damage this thing is doing cuz well I mean cost-effective wise for an ammo it could be good oh I'm missing shots boys it's gonna take like 10 clips to kill this thing oh my god think it is think of the power here okay it's a primary weapon you're not using any sort of special ammo you're not using any rockets or grenade launchers this could be sick in gambit like on the on the boss it's just sustained damage I think people are sleeping on the Cerberus everyone's calling it garbage I mean in PvE or sort of PvP it's probably garbage in PvP but this this has some real potential like especially if you buff yourself the damage on this would be pretty incredible like hold on let me let me do up let me do like a volley of this grenade launcher on this boss and see see how much damage we do just to get an idea oh I missed I missed one rocket so let's say 2/3 of its health I don't know I I'm I'm convinced that the Cerberus is actually kind of good a PvE god-tier I mean it's an exotic so I mean what are your thoughts I'm so lost on this this is actually shocking to me terrible absolutely terrible in PvP but PvE I'm seeing some major potential especially on on those overloaded enemies they get stunned you could just walk right up to and just eat on it with the with the Cerberus and not use any of your heavy like if you're looking at the damage of using a primary weapon this Trump's it by far damage per shot it shoots slow I get that but this could be this could this could be something this could be very powerful thank you guys for watching hopefully enjoy it and I'll see you soon bye bye
