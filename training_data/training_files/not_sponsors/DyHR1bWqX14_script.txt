developed a unique sound that's taken the world by storm but even more than their music what's truly groundbreaking about 21 pilots is their storytelling they combine lyrics and music videos with cryptic images released on their website and social media put together at all hints at a broad dystopian story but it's not laid out clearly instead it's up to the fans to decipher and draw meaning from everything let's take a closer look in April 20 18 fans of twenty one pilots noticed that a video on their website had been changed the new version contained a brief flash of a URL at the end following that link brought you to a website full of scanned images notes from a character named Clancy and short black-and-white video clips and just like that the search was on 21 pilot fans known as the skeleton click began to dig through this information furiously pulling out any hints they could this culminated in a reddit mega thread where everyone pulled together the information they found including hints and lyrics and even a line from a 2017 awards be Tyler wishes he could be here he's actually off severing ties with FEMA pieced together all of this tells a story and well it's filled with strange imagery and obscured plot points the story is simple at its core it's about Clancy's escape from the dystopian city of Deema controlled by nine bishops some people think that the nine bishops are represented in the artwork to the band's previous album blurryface the bishops are led by Nicolas Bourbaki or Niko for short his name comes from a group of French mathematicians who published under that pseudonym that group created the notation for an empty set or zero a symbol that 21 pilots have used liberally throughout their career trenches 3rd song morph discusses Niko by Nate he's trying to stop me that Nicolas Bourbaki he's got no friends close but those who know a most no he goes by Niko he told me I'm a copy when I do remind me that's almost stopped me the 9th song on trench Niko and the Niners also discusses the bishops and their rule the music video for that song shows the city of demos the name Dima comes from the Persian word for towers of silence which were a kind of structure built by Zoroastrians Zoroastrian tradition had strict rules around disposing of the dead dead bodies would be laying out on these structures so that carrion birds could come and eat them carrion birds are another important image for 21 pilots the dma org website features a gif of a vulture and the artwork for trench also features a vulture lyrically the band puts some meaning to the vulture imagery in levitate where they talk about how being a celebrity and being in the public eye is like being left out for carrion Birds another important part of trench's story is the Bandidos a rebellious group Clancy joins up with when he's trying to leave Deema the aptly named song Bandido from the album talks about this group [Music] my blood could also be about Clancy joining the Bandidos and finding new family clearly we could go on with references from within the story for hours it's told through dozens of small bits and intertwining hints but what I want to talk about is the biggest theme of the story mental illness Tyler Joseph one half of twenty one pilots has struggled with mental illnesses entire life this is something he wrote about on blurryface where he created a character that was a representation of his insecurities by tying the nine bishops to the artwork of blurryface we can see that the bishops are also representations of different aspects of Joseph's own self-doubt and mental illness these themes come through pretty clearly in the lyrics to jumpsuit this song reads like a reflection of social anxiety on gravestones taps further into the themes of depression discussing how we glorify mental illness and celebrities my opinion not culture can treat a loss like it's a win and right before we turn on them week the highest of brazen hang the banner from a ceiling communicating further engraving and earlier grave is an optional way no instead of glorifying his own mental illness Tyler Joseph seeks to empathize with people struggling with depression and find other things to celebrate glorify me but we swap out what it is that we hold so high find your grandparents or someone of age pay some respects for the path that they paved to life they were dedicated now that should be celebrated the symbolism around mental illness is clear in the very city of Deema as well a city designed in the shape of an X carnation structure is a perfect metaphor for the suicidal thoughts that come with depression death is in the very architecture of the city and clancy is trapped in Deema just like people are trapped by their own mental illness and so trench becomes the story of Clancy escaping Deema it becomes the story of Tyler or the story of anyone who listens to the album fighting against mental illness and learning to live with it the color yellow is a major theme in the album storytelling and it's representative of this fight it's the color of the Sun the color of hope the story of Clancy's escape is played out partially in a trilogy of videos jumpsuit Nico and the Niners and levitate these videos show Clancy's liberation pulling shots from the original DMARC website and bringing them to fruition they feature jumpsuits with yellow straps the symbol of the Bandidos and of rebellion against dima rebellion against depression [Music] I think it was a brilliant move for 21 pilots to craft this narrative as a dystopian story it's a kind of story that we're all familiar with full of archetypal figures and settings given the disjointed nature of the telling it will be more difficult to grasp a story with structure that wasn't so embedded in our collective unconscious but at the same time just hope Ian's stories allow for world building and that's something twenty one pilots do with vigor on trench the world building is a key part of the storytelling because it allows listeners to jump into deema themselves as you Ducote twenty one pilots messages you feel like you're part of an underground movement perhaps most importantly this helps build a community around cracking these riddles one of the biggest struggles for many people with mental illness is that they feel alone like they don't have anybody in their corner and like they have no reason to get out of bed and face the world every day when you're working as part of a digital team to crack twenty one pilots secret codes it gives you something to look forward to something to power you through your day and a community to rely on in the end I don't think we'll ever have a crystal-clear picture of the narrative of trench and I think that's for the better without a master narrative we can pull our own meaning from the work and apply these to our lives and our own struggles against anxieties self-doubt and depression as twenty one pilots have grown as a band they've continued to push boundaries they make use of all of the tools at their disposal particularly their dedicated fan base to create a wholly unique experience and that's what trench is it's more than just an album it's more than just a video trilogy it's an interactive storytelling experience one that's constantly shifting and changing and honestly everything we know about dima clancy and the Bandidos is probably just the beginning this video is brought domain [Music] you
