[Music] call of cthulhu dark corners of the earth is a first-person survival horror game developed by headfirst productions and published by Bethesda Softworks for Xbox in 2005 and PC in 2006 I will be playing the PC version because I did not steal the Xbox version when I should have and it is now absurdly expensive and collectible its development can be traced back to 1999 when Andrew brazier of head first asks a Lovecraft fan forum what they would like to see in a potential game based completely on the Cthulhu Mythos this feedback would be taken to heart even though it sounds like he was really trying to drive the discussion towards a multiplayer open-world kind of thing which it didn't turn out to be they would begin work making the most faithful and accessible Cthulhu game possible drawing from games like Deus Ex Half Life and the rich lore of the Call of Cthulhu tabletop RPG over the years dark corners of the earth would hit several snags and delays most notably in 2002 when their original publisher fishtank was taken over by Joe wood who were ultimately not interested in publishing the nearly completed game things seemed to turn around when a deal with Bethesda was made for publishing with a release date of 2004 and an appearance at e3 in 2003 well needless to say the game did not make the window by a couple years and as far as I know did not show up at e3 that year but I'm sure it had all the staples of an early 2000s III you know a lot of this being a thing and a lot of neat games being shown since it was a year without a pending console well I aside from Nokia's little sideways taco phone in the lead-up to the game's release numerous ideas and mechanics including the game's original genre would be discarded as it passed through different hands and it's more ambitious ideas proved to be too difficult expensive or time-consuming adding to this head first had really put all of their eggs in one basket assuming this would be a giant success so they already had an auxilary team at work on the game sequel which was to be called Call of Cthulhu Destiny's end unfortunately infighting had dissolved their relationship with Bethesda and their backup plan had filed for bankruptcy so two years later with the Xbox 360 a mere month away hemorrhaging money due to its prolonged production time its developer cleaning out its desk and next to no proper advertising Call of Cthulhu silently crept out for the original Xbox all this culminated in what could be considered a wildly inventive commercial failure it maintains a decent number of defenders and fans who hold it up as an underrated cult classic I count myself among them though the last time I played it was ten years ago thankfully time has eroded my ability to see much good in anything Call of Cthulhu dark corners of the earth is technically its own original narrative but it does draw heavily from several of Lovecraft's short stories most notably the shadow over Innsmouth and the shadow out of time in 1915 detective Jack Walters is called to the site of a police standoff with a cult called the fellowship of the youth apparently the cults leader Victor Holt has specifically asked to speak with Jack before he can even make contact with holt a fire fight erupts between the cult and the police causing Jack to run for cover in their hideout inside he finds the fellowship was in the midst of a mass suicide before the siege following some strange noises he heads towards the building's basement which is occupied by an elaborate McCobb device of alien origin fiddling with it opens a portal to another dimension where strange alien creatures emerge before Jack passes out upon waking up Jack's personality seems to have fractured and he is committed to Arkham Asylum though it is not long before the Asylum relents that though he seems to be an entirely different person he is of no danger to the public and his fit to be released back into the world Jack seemingly carries on an alternate life for six years before the jack we see at the beginning of the game regains control of his body with no memory of what he was up to for half a decade saved for hallucinations and nightmares not having the best track record with the police Jack finds work as a freelance private detective where in between cases he investigates his own actions during his missing six years which from the looks of it involved a lot of travel and occult research which sounds great but in the context of this game is less than comforting so five months after is let's be real vacation can't can't believe you complain about that I you know what I would love a vacation I'd love to go somewhere exotic like Pip yet the city of the future he is hired to investigate the disappearance of a grocer named Brian Burnham and a sum of money from his employer safe in the isolated seaside town of Innsmouth the client chooses to go through Jack because the police force and Innsmouth is not trustworthy plus they're all free and the town itself seems to have no interest in the affairs of outsiders that much is clear when Jack shows up in in Smith's on the only bus that passes through the first third of this game takes place in this town which effectively feels old crumbling in on itself oppressive and like every eye in town is watching your step adding to this tension is built even further thanks to these cutaways to a different person or creatures perspective where we can quite literally see something tailing us from dark alleys and jumping across rooftops the civilians refuse to answer any of your questions shrugging you off and grotesque and guttural voices get widely shares all right nowit looking at them reveals the tell-tale signs of the Innsmouth look which is in reference to the oily Ixia logical characteristics they have taken on but like the short story there are very few willing to help and the only credible source of exposition comes in the form of a transient possibly unstable alcoholic named static though in this version there are a handful of other helpful characters that show up at different points to flesh out different aspects of the those including J Edgar Hoover I have really strong fond memories of dark corners of the earth and in replaying I realized that much of these memories are of the first two hours or so I think this is the most enjoyable segment and the closest the game gets to replicating the atmosphere and tone of a Lovecraft story it also doesn't hurt that the shadow over Innsmouth is my favorite Lovecraft story and parts of it are creatively reflected in this game and expanded on with ideas from the RPG book escape from ins myth most notably a sequence where in the hopes of speaking to someone with information about the town's devotion to a religious sect called the order of Dagon Jack shows up at the house of a man named Thomas Waits but finds that only his daughter is home these characters are not in the original story but may be loosely associated to another story called the thing on the doorstep it's a recent family photo the corners been torn off I can only see Thomas and Ramona waits in the picture the doors bolted shut I was filled with not only the intended dread but sheer joy that the game had made my shriveled a or tech sack spasm to life this is also just about the only moment in the game that clearly affects Jack throughout the entirety of the game this moment ends in a tragedy that is Jack's fault and you can tell that the guilt of that follows him up to the game's end it's one of the strongest scenes not just in a Lovecraft game but a horror game it may be just a game I could almost say the same thing about the inciting incident that kicks off the main action when Jack is forced to stay the night in Innsmouth as the bus is no longer in service he tries to settle down to sleep all the while cutaways show the town's folk and conspiring and plotting against you I am conflicted on it though because it was I feel the most effective part of the short story and while it is certainly rendered here to be terrifying it is one of the more challenging sequences because of its reliance on trial and error ultimately making it something conceptually terrifying but frustrating in execution but I can still tell there was careful consideration put into gradually filling you with dread and leaving you more or less defenseless before dropping the hammer into complete chaos after the main bits in the town the game moves across a number of set pieces playing like a greatest hits of Lovecraft haunts thing is once we leave Innsmouth the tone seems to change and the gameplay is mostly at fault but it's the first time the game truly reveals how much it misunderstands the difficulty in translating Lovecraft to videogame in the shadow over Innsmouth the protagonist was not a grizzled capable private eye he was a college student who in true horror movie fashion shows up to in Smith's bright-eyed and oblivious to what is to come did you'd see zap isse of jewelry in a museum it learns it's from Innsmouth and thinks that'd be a cute place to visit and then of course walks into a [ __ ] nightmare that reveals he is more connected to the town than he would like to be in the second to last chapter has him confronted by a reoccurring Lovecraft creature called a deep one which the mere sight of causes him to pass out in horror to this game's credit it certainly takes its time building up to the reveal of the deep ones the majority of the time that we cut away to someone else we are seeing through the eyes of one of these creatures and numerous hints are dropped that that deep ones are coming and you are going to piss yourself and die just by looking at them but Jack isn't that guy the rotting corpse of a rat I suppose it might come in useful Jack is a seasoned police officer who has researched the occult and already lost then recovered his mind more importantly Jack has a lot of guns and has little aversion to using them and it's not that I think guns or defending yourself has no place in the story or in this game even but when these creatures the deep ones show up within seconds of their reveal they are gunned down like little pieces of garbage you are then thrown a rifle and told to take out waves of them which is I think you'll agree in stark contrast to being so terrified at the sight of one that you piss yourself in faint they really just cash show up and then Kelsey Grammer themselves drip-drip - it's a small world pretending ours that you were an interpreter and obviously they knew that they knew that doing this would be dumb but somewhere along the line I'm guessing that was their only option it's also around here that I really became confused about what they were trying to do with Jack's character is he a frail vulnerable human being slowly losing his sanity or is he an anachronistic 50s noir badass shut your trap Maggie you're not a factor inspector who do you work for okay Maggie this is it you raised the lid and I'll crash the party jack is cool as a [ __ ] cuke but the gameplay wants you to think that he is vulnerable both physically and mentally it seems really inconsistent this is not to say that the rest of the game is void of cool plot twists creepy non sequiturs and creativity but by now most of your problems can be solved by shooting things and it's hard to look past that I was initially taken aback by one moment where you come across a man who could not live with the hideous hybrid creature he had become and just wants you to end his suffering it actually gave me pause and I thought wow maybe these parts aren't just shooting things then I shot it despite my gripes with two-thirds of this story I still think it nails the atmosphere and tone a lot of the time it's just that like most aspects of the game of the story can feel like an exquisite corpse like a team of writers each took a stab at writing parts of it and then they loosely stitched all those ideas together so sometimes it really works but other times the scenes can be distracting and it can muddle the lore by trying to weave multiple stories together it doesn't require much knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos to get into I mean you might appreciate some of the references and cameos but if anything it might actually be more effective if you have no idea what you're getting into I mean a lot of this dude's writing is comprised of fear from the unknown so what better way to experience that then it being unknown it's still the most satisfied I've been with an adaptation of the story the movie Dagon was pretty good too if you see a more modern take on the shadow over Innsmouth even though it's called Dagon which is weird but I guess this game is called Call of Cthulhu and it's not a straight adaptation of that story either so who gives a [ __ ] dark corners of the earth from a gameplay standpoint is very uneven completely broken in some areas with the occasional lucid moment of near brilliance the first area seems the most fitting as it requires you to rely on stealth and evasion sneaking into buildings through alleys to carry out your investigations without alerting the locals like most mechanics here stealth and its effectiveness are sort of nebulous I'm not quite sure how it works he's over there dagger this was probably felt even more at the time because dark corners came out a year after thief deadly shadows and Splinter Cell Pandora tomorrow both games with well-received stealth mechanics in this one however sometimes it feels unfair that an enemies spotted or heard me sneaking by and other times I'm baffled that they didn't see me pass right in front of them there is no measurement of stealth there is no measurement for much of anything due to the game's minimal heads-up display which is to say it's lack of one deciding to entirely declutter your perspective and remove any bars or readouts was I think the right call to make even though its implementation isn't always effective the insanity system was something proudly trotted out in most interviews with the developers and for the most part I think it is really clever bearing witness to otherworldly creatures violent imagery or even Heights will stress out jack the more your sanity drains the more it will affect your perception this can range from blurred vision and increased heart rate to intense visual distortions auditory hallucinations and Jack may even begin muttering to himself out loud it is best practice to halter buck and just stab me in the heart just stab me in the heart get it over it is best practice to holster any weapon you have and take a moment to calm down before proceeding your sanity can also be restored at save points which are scarce and deeply comforting to find as enemies will not go near them one of the few moments where you know you're probably maybe safe this idea paired with Jack's in general vulnerability to harm is almost really endearing I like the idea of a protagonist that is clearly being affected by the circumstances he has put through this idea is what sold me on the game well not sold it convinced me to steal there was a lot of discussion and variation on how this would impact gameplay like affecting some kind of stats or skill tree but ultimately its function is therefore atmosphere and I don't mind that dealing with physical damage is kind of inventive as well like a lot of games you can pick up first-aid kits to heal yourself but instead of acting as an immediate cure-all they are filled with different healing items that you can ration out and strategically use as needed for different injuries like splints bandages and sutures different injuries will also hinder your control of Jack broken legs will cause him to limp broken arms will affect his ability to aim weapons bleeding wounds will cause your vision to slowly dissipate and time will seem to slow down either that's what was happening or just the framerate would give every time I started bleeding I couldn't really tell if that was intentional or not you can also just press H to emergency heal whatever you can without regard to items this is always accompanied by a slow but realistic animation that can be agonizing if you're in danger the first weapon you are given is a crowbar which felt good because it wasn't a huge step up from being unarmed it was still a risky endeavor trying to take down an enemy without alerting more enemies in the process sometimes it's just real tough to kill these Frank I think I would have preferred more difficult to wield melee weapons as your primary means of defense maybe they could be breakable or generally unreliable as your brazier once mentioned that most objects the player finds lying around can be used as weapons they did not do that that would have been cool a lot of things about this game would have been but it's not long after this that we are given two guns and the game feels entirely different despite it's wandering AI I pre guns still felt like I had to make an effort to avoid being spotted I had to try to trick enemies and isolate them and just beat them over the head and hope they didn't panic and fire off around you could even use a police whistle to distract them and lead them towards a safe point where they would avert their eyes leaving them open to a crowbar to the face and chest it's like once I had guns I began to see how truly is silly and ineffective enemies are the game is so linear that if you sort of roleplay and do everything it wants you to do it might feel like it's smarter than it is but really you could just waltz up to all of these enemies and shoot them sure others may come after you but you could just shoot them too I mean the artifice here is that everything is telling you to conserve ammo because it's hard to come by and without it you won't stand a chance even the shitty walk through I consulted repeatedly made pains to remind me of that but that is simply not the case you will always have ammo for at least one of your weapons provided you take the time to aim up your shots and you will have that time because it's not as though enemies do much more than stand and shoot at you wildly I think I may have seen one crouched behind cover but that may have just been my imagination there is some realism to the fact that you don't have an ammo readout so you need to count your shots you don't have an aiming reticle so you have to use your weapons iron sights and aiming around corners can be kind of unreliable but you don't really have to fall back on any other strategy then shoot them somewhere in the center of their body a couple times the more I played the more I kept wanting to believe that the enemies were smarter than they were but they're way dumb these guys are dummies shooting them doesn't feel satisfying or visceral because they fall over and immediately blink out of existence like an arcade light gun shooter looking garbage truck out there making so much noise and it is it only serves as a reminder of how much my life is garbage maybe as many as 60,000 human sacrifices per year it's sort of immersion breaking for a game that goes out of its way to express realism later segments in the game will require stealth once more and provide a much-needed shot of anxiety I'm not saying you can't have a game with guns and stealth obviously many games have effectively balanced that but it simply doesn't work in this one if you have a gun you don't need to be stealthy unless you want to intentionally play the game that way to artificially make it tense which is what I ended up doing for a long time before I relented around halfway through the pieces of a stealth based survival horror game are there though its husk is there if you get the knife you can sneak up behind enemies and wind up for a one-hit kill that actually feels pretty good you died good enough it's just sad that you don't have to do that I don't think I should be intentionally following the path of most resistance to make the gameplay more intense there is also the added frustration of a Lovecraft fan that you know we really are just shooting all these ancient cosmic creatures with guns these mythical gods we defeat them with bullets which is odd because an interview with head first claimed that the plan with dark corners of the earth was that guns would not act as means of killing enemies but deterring them slowing them down but as far as I can recall there was only one enemy in the whole game that was impervious to guns and you defeat him by luring him in front of a flamethrower it's a to gray area but I mean it's a it's a thing that propels some sort of munitions of sorts you know you're not gonna get that one past me that's that's a gun it's a fire gun she was fire you still die in over there I wouldn't say the game is overly easy so much is when you do die which will probably be a lot it rarely feels fair like in the handful of escape sequences that will no doubt transcend fear into frustration as there is only one specific way and one specific timing to overcome it and even though you are mercifully given in autosave beforehand it is often right before an unskipable cutscenesthat's nice kappa we gonna come across a lot of glitches bugs unfinished ideas I was immediately struck by a reoccurring crash that would happen when I tried to enter the basement at the cult hideout which others seem to have circumvented by replacing the game's exe file with that of the GOG released there are other glitches where the game locks you in place for a cutscene but doesn't play the cutscene there is an entire boss fight that to this day has gone unpatched by Bethesda or Valve where you are supposed to shoot out some enemies on an island using a ship's cannon the only issue is that in the PC version the island and the enemies are missing so either you try to mimic the appropriate positioning of the cannons and hope you make three really good educated guesses or you download a fan-made patch that tricks the game into thinking you've already completed that challenge it's it's really just baffling that over a decade later nobody saw fit to amend a game breaking bug also there's a segment where you need to hold on to these rings attached to a cliffside that is being hit by waves but you don't really I don't think that was actually implemented before the game was shipped thing is it was clear from early interviews with headfirst that they didn't really know what they were going to do with this game and what they did know they didn't know how they were going to pull it off but I think among this choir of voices were some who had really interesting progressive takes on not just a Lovecraft game but game design in general and it's a testament to how effective moments of it are that anyone would tolerate the games and myriad issues to experience them what the [ __ ] happened that even I can still say there is something there there is something telling me it's good beneath the deafening scream that is saying it isn't I certainly wouldn't fault someone for looking up a walkthrough maybe not IGN so though I don't know how they go about curating their walkthroughs but this one was written by a real piece of [ __ ] keep back I'll figure something out okay wait hang out hang out what am I supposed to do you all you need to do once the cutscene is over is run for your little pathetic life back through the boxes alright unnecessary but worthwhile information to know thank you very much Brian should pay handsomely once he can start putting Ruth's heels next to her head while he's on top hot preacher daughter's body made unavailable via so getting Ruth I must [ __ ] billing it and probably one off to find it dressers the generation of Xbox and ps2 was not the most visually arresting era in videogame history and even though dark corners of the earth came out near the end of Xboxes life it was still sort of rough looking in 2005 looks better on PC but being a port a lot of the low resolution assets are carried over like the menu interface which looks like it's perpetually buffering and at any moment it will come into focus but it never does I'm not picky about the limitations of past generations I don't care if your game looks bad and I can acknowledge that it looks a bit dark and muddy but it's still in keeping with the game's atmosphere which is one of its strongest assets the citizens of ins myths look appropriately fishy and unnerving I am not however a fan of the letter boxes that appear during cutscenes they serve absolutely no purpose and are just about the only thing that breaks the clean untainted lack of interface in that same interview from earlier the idea is thrown around that like half-life cutscenes would happen seamlessly and wouldn't take control from you I think that would have been a smart move if anything I wish we could at least skip these cutscenes because they are a real bummer especially when you die multiple times and have to watch them multiple times voice acting is mostly passable with the notable exception of Jack he may be written inconsistently but what is consistent is his performance your friend is dead Jesus Christ no it's just consistently bored and lifeless everybody else sounds great at least in comparison a lot of the sound effects sound kind of odd they have a weird production quality to them it's like it's not the best quality but that's somehow it makes them more effective it's like they're creepier because wait why do they sound like that I like all the gross gurgling dialogue from enemies especially when they're hunting you through the streets there is a guy stuck in a prison cell that just endlessly rants about lore that is fantastic dude is just going for it it's like one of the best performances and it's just a throwaway bit then I shot it though the soundtrack is pretty good the production is a little artificial but the writing is solid I can tell there's a lot of thought put into the tone of each area all the tracks in the refinery section have a industrial mechanical vibe with clanking metallic percussion and steamy synths if that's a thing [Applause] the temple of Dagon area has a ton of reverb drenched harpsichord I might be mistaken but I just want to heard something approximating a theremin at one point it was really good there are some really effective ambient tracks and the more calm moments and getting spotted or put through a chase sequence is accompanied by more exciting and panic-inducing tracks with intense drumming and even a hint of electric guitar these work a lot better when they don't loop as clearly and it's also really nice that long stretches of the game have absolutely no music for what is more terrifying than just being left alone with your thoughts call of cthulhu dark corners of the earth is not an easy game to get into or appreciate and on top of that there are numerous obstacles in the way of just experiencing the game the way it was meant to be played if you look at the negative reviews on Steam a number of them opened by claiming it's one of their favourite games but the state of this version prevents them from giving it a good review many suggest that if you're interested you should buy the gog release as it is less broken steam doesn't give a [ __ ] bethesda probably has other bigger things to worry about like accidentally tying their shoes together but you can find some neat patches not only for bugs but for making the game more forgiving if you can set aside and forgive the game for general inconsistencies and unintuitive mistrial and error frustrations baffling game design unfinished mechanics crashes bugs hatred induced nosebleeds various wounds caused by clawing at yourself then he might find a lot of neat stuff here I'll admit there there's a remnant of nostalgia here and it's married to my idealization of what the game could have been but I couldn't in good conscience say yeah that's a good game I recommend that game to anybody and yet I'm pretty sure I'd play it again at some point it's the most puzzling relationship I've had with a game it's [ __ ] awesome I hate it [Music] Gaudio toreano I like the way you smile at me babe I like that when you call me I like the way smart with me babe so baby wanna smile [Music]
