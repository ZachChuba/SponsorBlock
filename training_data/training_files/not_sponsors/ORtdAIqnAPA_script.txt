sponsored by brilliant there's a story about Steve Jobs coming into the Mac product meeting dropping an iPad on the table and asking them in typical Steve Jobs fashion why the Mac just couldn't do that couldn't be that instant on with a battery that lasted the whole day thanks to the halo of the iPod and iPhone and iPad Apple had gone from a beloved if niche computer company to a mainstream technology powerhouse sales of iOS devices were dwarfing anything they'd ever seen with Mac OS devices and higher levels of computing were becoming approachable and accessible to more people than ever before the same desires and drives that led to the creation of the iPad led to the evolution of the whole new generation of Mac books it started with 2011 and the MacBook Air an ultra portable that became ultra popular so much so it went on to define a generation of knockoff ultra ebooks what could a macbook pro do that was less about traditional power users and more about empowering the much larger mainstream prosumer market or you know if you're cynical you could call that the desire to sell pro machines at pro prices to the far larger amount of people who are starting to self-identify as pros that's because the pro market was changing as well sure you still had your ultra high-end pros who worked on cutting if not bleeding edge video audio photography animation science and other areas where they constantly need it to render and bounce an export and model and compute more and faster than ever but thanks to software like Final Cut Pro 10 and logic 10 and Lightroom and xcode in coda gear costs coming down and processing power coming up you also had people starting new companies and side hustles who also wanted pro machines realistically sure but even aspirationally even if only to keep 20 damn chrome tabs open without freezing up the whole machine those are the conditions the ingredients that I believe led to the 2016 MacBook Pro to see if Apple could do with the pro what they done with the air nevermind what they done with the iPad you can see it in that very first MacBook Pro lineup there was a stripped-down model at the bottom that Apple expressly said was for those always wanted a retina MacBook Air but there was no loaded up model at the top for people who wanted a more classical more powerful MacBook Pro so much so the whole line was sarcastically referred to by some as the MacBook Air pro and in a way the strategy worked it totally worked the 2016 MacBook Pro and it's iterations reportedly sold better than any MacBook Pro before it a whole new generation of pros bought into them hard and I'll readily admit I'm one of them i legit loved everything about that generation of pros except for the anemic webcam and of course the keyboard issues that gained so much attention later but traditional high-end pros felt abandoned forgotten maybe even a little betrayed and that's just the beginning of the story I'm Rene Richey and this is vector now I'll get to the keyboards in a scalding hot minute I swear it's what everyone wants to hear about I know but I'm gonna quickly cover a couple of other things first starting with the memory for the first couple of years the then new MacBook Pros were limited to 16 gigabytes of memory that's because they used lpddr3 or low-power ddr3 memory and because Intel was behind schedule and getting behind her lpddr4 which supported higher memory limits just hadn't rolled out yet back then Apple wasn't willing to sacrifice on power efficiency which meant battery life so they stuck with the 16 gigabyte limit and used custom storage controllers and ultra fast SSD to try to make swap feel so fast most people wouldn't really notice a limit if they hit it and aside from just hating the number on the spec sheet most people didn't but of course high-end pros did so by 2018 Apple reversed course they went back to the non low powered ddr4 memory added an option for 32 gigabytes and also added extra Power Cells so the overall battery life wouldn't change and the 16 inch now goes all the way up to 64 gigabytes they also started increasing the storage options going all the way up to 4 terabytes of SSD last year and a whopping 8 terabytes of SSD this year with the 2016 MacBook Pro Apple also went all in on us BC and Thunderbolt 3 2 ports at the low end 4 ports at the high end gone were the USBA and HDMI ports the SD card slot and mag safe and if you wanted them back or you wanted anything else you had to use adapters now some people decry that as being hostile to prose but paradoxically it really wasn't it was hostile to the very mainstream prosumers Apple was targeting see prose are used to adapters firewire 400 firewire 800 VGA display port HDMI mini DisplayPort Thunderbolt 2 compact flash see Fast & huggs because there are just never enough ports regardless of what type they are it's the reality of working in production environments where equipment ranges from very old to very new and there's just tons of it you get used to adapters you actually start to prefer adapters you can throw away your old adapters as you get new gear and new cables and take advantage of the new ports and their throughput but you can't ever dig out an old port and shove in a newer better one I just had to buy a new C fast reader for this camera right here so the beat always goes on but the mainstream users the people who just have tons of USBA peripherals including the lightning to USB a cables Apple kept shipping with iPhones until just this very year because they are so mainstream the people who aren't using cinema cameras and their wacky often proprietary storage formats but the far more ubiquitous cameras that made SD card slots so convenient Apple is the company that dumped the floppy drive for USB a to begin with and they certainly seem to believe USB C would take off just as fast but it hasn't and unlike almost everything else with the MacBook Pros Apple hasn't reverted on this not by a single port or slot time is ease some of the pressure but not all of it not yet it's clear though Apple still thinks it will the other big complaint about the 15-inch MacBook Pros especially in the middle years was thermal throttling it's a complicated issue but one that's actually simpler to explain the 2016 MacBook Pro chassis was designed for Intel chips that would quickly shrink down to 10 nanometers increasing power but also balancing it with greater efficiency but Intel hasn't been able to come through and is now years and years behind schedule even when they do push out new versions of the old chips they're chronically late in making the specific versions Apple needs to be available and often can't even keep up with demand when they do so Apple has chosen to manage the problem instead there was a bug in the 20 teen version that made people think Apple had just failed to manage the thermals completely but Apple apologized for it and it was fixed in a software update still it became almost a cliche in so many videos and literally every comment section now Apple has opinions on this stuff that some would disagree with big-time they don't seem to mind running hot even at thermal limits like not at all they also don't mind using faster chips that can sustain peak performance because they firmly believe those chips still benefit first intensive workflows cynics would argue that Apple needs to market a core I nine machines just to keep up with the competition for the spec sheet pragmatist that Apple is making the best out of a bad silicon situation like architecting everything from metal to the accelerators on the tea to chips to the GPUs to work not just with the processors but around them which is why people who just download and run benchmarks can't really see or understand what's hitting CPU GPU or accelerator blocks anymore or how but for people who run and show real-world work flow tests overall the results have shown consistent year-over-year improvements just not as big as anyone including Apple would have liked which is why then use 16 inch MacBook Pro has a new thermal system to better address sustained workloads when Apple launched the 12-inch MacBook in 2015 it came with two huge changes to input the first was the force touch trackpad I know I know we'll get to the keyboard I swear but this is important for context at the time Apple had what we're already universally regarded as the best trackpads in the business but it wasn't enough for them they wanted to push the boundaries so they got rid of the actual mechanical trackpad switch and put a virtual one in its place when the computer was off it felt like a solid dead piece of glass in metal when the computer was on though that solid piece used proprioceptive trickery to come alive and make you think you felt an actual click where none really existed yeah physics was a lie and fingers liars it was a huge risk people loved the MacBook trackpad but Apple believed the changes were for the better they would remove the hinge like effect where the top of the trackpad barely clicked and the bottom clicked a lot and make for a more consistent overall better experience and they were totally right going on five years later while the forced press parts never caught fire the overall trackpad has been pure fire it's now the better best trackpad in the business and I dare say people love it even more Apple also had what were universally regarded as some of the best keyboards in the business as well but again it wasn't good enough for them they also wanted to push the boundaries there so they went with the butterfly switches and metal domes that were four times as stable they also made each key bigger and more concave some people legitimately liked it better myself included others decidedly did not some that dislike did saw it as a fair compromise for a computer as ultra portable as the 12-inch MacBook others again did not not even then going on five years later though that keyboard hasn't caught fire it's been on fire it's now commonly regarded as one of the worst keyboards in the industry and while some people still like to feel better others still hate its breathing guts and everybody everybody hates its failure rates and here's where Apple has its biggest problem in the very beginning right when Apple releases changes like the force touch trackpad and the butterfly keyboard and people push back on them hard it's impossible to tell one from the other that's because humans hate change so when there are immediate complaints Apple just holds firm they truly believe they made the right choices for the right reasons and that as change of version fades people will see what they saw and they'll come to believe the choices were right the reasons valid and the benefits undeniable and it happens almost all the time so before any widespread reports on failures as well confident in the keyboard and their choices and that anyone still change adverse would still come around Apple went ahead and pushed the butterfly keyboard out to the MacBook Pro but with some critical differences first even though the MacBook Pro was designed to be more portable to appeal to more portable pros unlike the 12-inch MacBook it wasn't designed to be ultra portable so the segment of people who didn't like the butterfly switch as much as a scissor switch but we're willing to accept it on the MacBook just weren't so willing to accept it at all on the MacBook Pro also the 12-inch MacBook still had a row of function keys even if they were butterfly function keys the MacBook Pro replaced that entire row with touch bar one that took away the escape key one of the most important keys to developers who had become the single biggest segment of the pro market again while some people including me preferred the new butterfly keyboards others really really hated them and nobody just nobody hated the old scissor switch ones then the stories about failure rates started to hit first the keys would get stuck presumably from dust and debris getting in when they weren't supposed to and then being unable to get out second high usage Keys would sometimes either stop connecting and not enter a character when pressed or bounced and entered double characters when pressed which some theories attribute to wear or weakening of the metal dome now every component has a failure rate I had a similar failure on an older scissor switch MacBook Pro and I had to take it in for exactly the same kind of repair that's why it's never a specific failure but always the failure rate that's important a certain amount of failure is normal it sucks but it's normal as the rate gets higher it becomes abnormal a bigger and bigger problem and as a perception of failure increases well that becomes another problem entirely when faced with these kinds of issues there are a couple of different courses of action a company like Apple can take the first is to reverse course and go back or go different Apple has done this in the past with things like the wide iPod Nano and the button list iPod shuffle the second is to hold course and try to make the new design work to iterate especially if you as a company still believe it to be better Apple has done this before as well like with the iPhone for antenna which gave us the much better iPhone 4s antenna with the butterfly keyboards Apple seems to have done both likely because they still believe in the design and want to keep it around especially for future ultra portable MacBooks but also to replace it with the new magic keyboard on the new 16 inch MacBook Pro and in fact the butterfly fixes we've seen have included a membrane to keep out dust and debris and a new material for the dome to preserve key connections the last set of fixes debuted earlier this year the new keyboard just last week designing prototyping testing iterating testing iterating and releasing into production a new keyboard isn't something that happens in weeks and months it happens in a year or two of months and like I said in my hands-on and we'll say again in my review the new magic keyboard so far feels so great the stability of butterfly with the better travel and hopefully resiliency of scissor switches and rubber domes it's so good I think it would be a huge mistake for Apple to keep the butterfly keyboard around any longer even on new ultra portable machines and for the very reasons I mentioned just a few minutes ago sometimes like with the force touch trackpad big gambles pay off others like with the butterfly switch keyboards they do not bury them salty earth move on new scissor switch magic keyboards for everyone over the last couple of years I think we've seen Apple do a real turnaround on the pro market as much as 2016 and 2017 felt like pro machines were going way too mainstream at best and being left to lie fallow at worst 2018 and 2019 have been almost a Renaissance best of all in my opinion Apple has hired on full-on Pro workflows team to hammer on new Macs to complain and contribute before they ever hit customers they've kept them more prosumer friendly models on the low end which is fine totally fine it fits with Apple's philosophy of always making technology approachable to more and more people but they've been releasing better models on the high-end pro end now as well including a new Mac Mini and soon a new Mac Pro I think Apple realized as a company they weren't really empowering every user if they left power users all of you for supporting the show and hopefully this is once again the new normal at least that's what I think hit like if you do share if you care subscribe and best scar steal that Bell gizmo if you haven't already and then jump into the comments and let me know what do you think about how Apple is course-correcting on the new pro Macs and what else do they still need to do spoiler webcams thanks for watching see you next video
