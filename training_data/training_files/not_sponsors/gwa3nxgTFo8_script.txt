hello everyone welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is Caitlin and I upload a whole bunch of different types of videos over on this channel mainly surrounding true-crime and psychological cases as well as a little bit to a fashion and lifestyle sprinkled in what I can today I'm back with another very exciting video and content from there through the now TV entertainment pass the documentary relating to today's video is called Kemper on Kemper inside the mind of a serial killer and it is fascinating and it's a very very very well-done documentary that kind of not only looked into the crimes of a serial killer so if you are a fan of watching things related to Seattle is you'll definitely enjoy this but it's also very different because it shows kind of the aftermath and how much this individual had impacted behavioral science and forensic investigations unit following his crimes it's very fascinating so like I said if information you need will be in the description below but for today's video I'm basically going to be focusing on Edmund Kemper the serial killer that is kind of featured in this documentary I'm gonna talk you through his early life his crimes and also what happened after he was caught and everything like that so I know there are a lot of you guys who do enjoy serial killer valeted hopefully this is one for you so if you want to hear a little bit about Edmund Kemper the serial killer known as the co-ed killer and keep on watching and research as to get started Edmund Emil Kemper the third was born on December the 18th in year of 1948 in a place called Burbank in California his biological parents were named clone L and Edmund Kemper jr. and he had a particularly interesting childhood I guess to say the least when Edmund had been just nine years old his parents decided to officially separate from the Marisa it said it's to take a break their marriage was quite an unstable one it wasn't very very secure at all and then they had officially separated before officially divorcing when he was 13 years old I'm quite an early age he'd shown size of a particularly high IQ he was seen as being a very very intelligent child from for a young age but he also in retrospect had shown some rather disturbing behaviors which now we know if we spot they are kind of warning signs for psychopathy and for some quite dangerous potentially dangerous individuals and behaviors but at the time it wasn't really known or thought of as anything concerning really so these behaviors included using his sister's dolls as a means of acting out strange rituals as well as having them found torturing and killing animals his relationship with his mother in particular was a strenuous one as she was very very harsh and abusive towards him she was known to go very ferb leave abusive she was quite overbearing and tormenting and they just really did not have a very good relationship whatsoever Kemper was believed to have been on the receiving end of years of humiliation and embarrassment at the hands of his mother and it was later considered the possibility of her having suffered from some form of personalities assault maybe or something that was undiagnosed that would explain her extreme emotional outbursts and pure anger towards her son while others have just argued that they just did not have a very very healthy relationship at all and pretty much the pair would just constantly argue and they would have very very extreme arguments and she would tell him over and over again he was worthless and he would never really amount to anything and he had this for many years his life there had been a period of his young life where he was actually confined to the basement in his family home it has his mother who had been concerned that if she'd left him roaming free in the house then he was harass or molest his two sisters he'd been living in this house surrounded by these three quite dominant woman who would belittle him and the only really male figureheads that he had in his life were his stepfathers that he would get to know and almost kind of attached himself to very briefly before they would then leave for whatever reason but his mother was she'd worked her way through a couple of men and so he didn't really have a lot of solid male role models in his life but he had these three dominant women but in defense of his family it is often noted in a number of sources that Edmunds family were very heavily involved in his life whether he had a successful relationship with them or not it's another question but they were very heavily involved in his life more so than a lot of other parents of children his age but he was himself quite a hard to manage young boy from a very young age Edmund had this constant fear of people and boys his own age humiliating him or hurting him to the point where he was never really able to make any form of connection with anyone his own age or near his own age so you really just couldn't be around his own peers and for many years it seemed as though his development in a number of centers which is completely stunted all stemming back to his feelings towards his parents divorced when he was young from a concerning lee young age he had appeared to have a number of rather extreme fantasies that would either be violent or sexual in nature or usually a combination of both as well as displaying at these unsettling behaviors that I'd said like killing these animals and torturing his sister's dolls and things like that in his early teens he became much too hard for his mother to manage by herself and Edmund had specifically asked her if he could move to LA where he would live with his father and his father's new wife but this situation didn't last at all simply because just as his mother had experienced when Edmunds father and stepmother kind of gotten to know him and saw that he was quite a difficult child they were at their wit's end just as much the mother was and they found it really difficult to live with him as well because they just didn t know how to handle him and then things in Edmonds life took a change completely at the end of 1963 during the Christmas holiday season he was just 15 years old at the time and he was said to stay with his paternal grandparents so his grandmother and grandfather on his father's side on their large farm in a place called North Fork in California and initially it obviously seemed as though as the temporary move but it became it seemed as though it was just becoming more and more permanent as the holidays Rover and Edmund remained there and they even started school in the area so when he began attending this local school he really made very little impression on his peers and teachers and all of the teachers that did recall him just kind of recalled him as being very very quiet despite the fact that he showed signs from a very young age of having a very very high IQ his grades throughout school remained completely average and he just seems like an unremarkable student but the one thing that did draw a significant amount of attention was his size for years now he had been showing signs of growing at a particularly accelerated rate and by that point so when he was 15 he was already much larger much taller than any boys his 8 so I believe I could be wrong but I believe by this point he was already about maybe 6 foot something and he would just continue to grow from there so he was very very tall his relationships with his grandparents that he had been living with were also far from perfect likely due to the fact that he was a difficult child however is also considered the relationship with his grandparents was far from perfect although this is likely due to the fact that he does seem as though he was a kind of very difficult child in itself however it was a much better situation than what I had been experiencing when he was living with his mother and his sisters Edmund and his grandfather in particular very very close the point why he'd even given him a 22 caliber rifle and so the admin can go out and use it regularly for hunting in the area since they lived on a farm and it actually turned out to be a very very effective outlet for all of his pent-up aggression in the summer months of the of 1984 when the school year had ended Edmond had returned back to his mother's house only to then be sent back to his grandparents just a few weeks later so his grandmother her name was Maude she had immediately made it known that she believed Edmond behavior had regressed significantly since he had come back from being at his mother's house even though he was only there for a very short period of time she said that his behavior had changed and regressed so clearly so significantly but it was like he had never made any progress since being at the farm because she said that his behavior he was doing really well in school you know he's he was behaving a lot better but this changed completely and it was almost as though he had never made any improvements just from the short trip home and it was around this point that it seemed as though all of his violent dark sexual fantasies began to return and this time the fantasies specifically featured his grandmother usually involving him ending her life using a gun in a particularly aggressive manner whenever he was out and about on the huge farm in property that his grandparents owned he would often line up Mord while she was kind of just moving about doing jobs and things on the farm and he would hold up his rifle and kind of look at her through the eye line of the rifle to give himself the feeling of power as though he was about to end her life obviously she would be completely unaware of this but this was just like a little game that he played to himself the he just found that he was enjoying Maude was said to have become quite wary of Edmunds change in behavior and seemed as though she was growing fearful of him not openly fearful but just increasingly fearful she'd allegedly taken her husband's pistol out of the house where possible purely out of concern that it would fall into Edmonds hands and then on August the 27th of 1964 all of the tension in the house came to a head edmond had been sacked after kitchen-table with more words she was most nervous in the work she was doing I think she was writing children's book or something when suddenly she looked up from her work and she'd seen Edmond just staring at her really really intensely and intently and it made her feel quite uncomfortable to the point where she asked him to stop very soon he stood up he headed out with his rifle caught for the dog and said that he was going out hunting Maud simply replied to him telling him not to shoot any birds because she didn't like that before then focusing back fully on the work that was on the table as Edmond left the house he turned back to see the back of Maude sat at the kitchen table would through the screen door to the kitchen so he turned that round and all he could see was mortar from behind he simply lifted his rifle aimed it at back of her head and fired a single shot this shot had been fatal but he decided to walk back into the kitchen and fired two more shots into her back he walked back round the kitchen wrapped a towel around her head and dragged her body into his grandparents bedroom just a few minutes passed before his grandfather kempert senior had returned home from food shopping when Edmond had also shot him in the back of the head while he was unloading the truck the documentary it said that Kemper claimed his main motive for killing his grandfather a man who he had been very close with and had actually loved had been because simply because he cared too deeply for him to want to put him through the pain of seeing his wife dead so he said he did it as an act of mercy from this point on Edmond had known that there wasn't any way that he could have escaped the blame for this it wasn't a likely scenario for his grandparents to suddenly just up and leave their farm and their grandson and take a last-minute trip and so he decided that it would kind of be a pointless F of him to try and hide the remains and cover everything up instead he said b-rank his mother telling him what happened who in turn told him to ring the local sheriff this is exactly what happened and upon being taken in for questioning he immediately confessed to murdering both of his grandparents his grandmother being one that he claimed he'd fantasized for quite a while while his grandfather's murder had been won out of an act of mercy because of Edmonds age he was held in juvenile hall while his fate was decided for him which is when a psychiatrist assigned to Edmonds case declared that he was both paranoid and psychotic as a result of this formal hypothesis he was committed to Atascadero State Hospital in December of 1964 aged just 15 years old now this was no joke of over place he was held here where there was very very serious and very very mentally and were like criminally insane individuals while he was held in the secure facility it mean that he would undergo very extensive treatment and tests for officials to not only try to understand his crime put - also try and understand what other similar offenders do what they do he had refused throughout initially to take responsibility for the crimes he had committed by commonly stating that everything had been kind of out of his control before long he had appeared to have improved significantly and he was kind of just like a model patient while he seemed to be putting his impressive intelligence to good use by aiding in laboratory research that was being carried out and kind of helping to administer psychological tests and but all of this was actually just his way of gaining knowledge of the system and what the officials and what the professionals would need to hear in order to see him as sane or see him as mentally sound cured or whatever it was all just kind of like a learning curve for him because he was learning how everything worked during his stay at Atascadero he had been diagnosed as a sociopath but these behaviors of being like cooperative and he gets help that he was displaying during this kind of research contradicts this diagnosis entirely leading professionals to have believed that there was a lot more improvement and development during his stay there than there actually had been while being a patient in this facility he had also come into regular contact like I said with some seriously or criminally insane offenders so he'd gotten to know a lot of concerning into the including a number of repeat offenders like serial rapists and very very violent individuals and these people had obviously shared with him the details of each of their crimes and not only was he able to kind of expand his fantasies and these dark thoughts that he was already having he was able to expand them even further because of hearing these stories but he was also able to hear where each of these offenders went wrong in their crimes what got them caught where they and where they made mistakes what they would do differently all of this again was just fueled his high intelligence to build his repertoire knowledge of how to be a criminal he had noted specifically the main mistake of many of the offender's that they had made during their attacks specifically sexual attacks had been that they had either attacked someone that they were directly linked with so there was some sort of relation there in some way or they had attacked them in a public place which left the possibility of witnesses was an extremely intelligent young man he was able to store all of these stores away in his head and like I said to build him on his fantasies and later help him carry out all of these disgusting crimes as a way of acting out his fantasies while also being able to maintain the image to professionals in the facility to give them the impression that he had made incredible strides in his development and then in the year of 1969 Edmund Kemper was released to the public soon after his release he was pretty much sent straight back living with his mother and he was held under supervision for a short period following his release just could still handle being in public but he went back to living in this potentially toxic environment with his mother and virtually immediately the pair had began to clash just as much they had done before one thing that was extremely prominent was that she had consistently told him that he had very low IQ so he was very very stupid you know he had low intelligence constantly over and over again and as well as the fact that he would never be good enough to get any girlfriends he would never be able to get any sort of girls interest and so in fact he was dumb and he never getting a girl for this was just pounded into him drilled into his head constantly over and over again by his mother around the area that the pair were living it was known as quite a relaxed and past the orientated area I guess in some ways because it was particularly close to UC Santa Cruz where a number of students pretty much always present and it was particularly common in the area for people particularly young students at the University to hitchhike around where everything needs to go it was just kinda like a common thing that happened in the area a lot and this just became the perfect opportunity for Kemper to just become a close of being close contact with all these young girls that he had always never had the opportunity to be with since he had been in incarcerated from such a young age he'd never really had the opportunity to come into contact with girls meaning that he's never really got the opportunity to understand all of these sorts of pretty young girls that his mother told him would never ever be interested in him or he would never be good enough for at first he would simply give these female hitchhikers rides to wherever they were going so he could understand how they would act around him and how he could gain their trust and have how he get them talking to him but also to train himself to see what extent he could control his own fantasies all the while his violent fantasies would be continuing in his head but now they involved specifically each of these female hitchhikers and this went on for months as a regular occurrence but then on maybe seventh in the of 1972 they was changed completely Marianne Pesci and Anita Lucia were two young female students who had been trying to hitchhike to Stanford University had been picked up by Edmund she proceeded to drive them around for a little bit before long he pulled out his gun which had been hidden under his seat in his car and threatened them while he drove them to a secluded he forced Anita to get into the boot of his car while threatening her at gunpoint or Mary Ann remained in the backseat once Anita was inside the boot he returned to Mary Ann and attempted to suffocate her using a bag and the terrycloth when she managed to bite through the bag ultimately stopping his efforts to suffocate her he pulled out a knife he had hidden on him and begins to violently attack her and he later reported that he had cut her throat from ear to ear following this attack he then returned to the trunk where he managed to lure out Anita by saying to her look this is blood over me and your friend freaked out on me I hate I think I broke my nose but I need to help can you come out and help me calm her down so she got out of the trunk thinking that she needed to go and help her friend because there had been an accident when she'd stepped out of the boot she was then also stabbed by Edmund she hadn't died initially he still had placed her body in the trunk with the body of her friend where she odd ultimately died these two bodies of the two young females remained in his boot while he drove back to his house and then inside his apartment he undressed Marianne's body and beheaded Anita's amongst doing a number of other things to the remains he specifically held on to both of their beheaded heads for a while before disposing of them he also dismembered parts of the bodies I believe to try and hide them and in August of that same year Mary Anne's head was found the next attack came on September the 14th in the year of 1970 Kemp ad spotted fifteen-year-old Aiko Koo who had missed her bust her dance class in the evening when he had offered her a ride but when she realized that he wasn't taking her in the right direction she began to panic she liked his two previous victims had been very brutally attacked he'd taken her remains home and dissected her remains carried out a number of different sexual acts initially not all of her remains were found and that first investigators hadn't linked this attack with the set of attacks on the two previous female victims and the two students they just kind of hadn't seen them as the same person as of yet and then in the early months of 1973 Kemper struck again when eighteen-year-old Cindy Scholl was travelling to her class when she disappeared someone initially had spotted her hitchhiking getting a lift from someone and then a few days later some dismembered limbs with on a cliff as well as a torso having washed ashore nearby which was later then confirmed to have belonged to Cindy it was around this time that the local media outlets began using words like the butcher to describe whoever it was that had been brutally attacking all of these young students and the name of the co-ed killer began to float around because of the fact that these students appeared to have been the targets and then on February the 5th Rosalind Thorpe and Alice knew had been hitchhiking when the pair of them both disappeared Edmund had picked up these two girls following a huge argument that he's had with his mother which just seemed to be the pattern it seemed to be every time him and his mother had argued he would then go out pick up a hitchhiking student and brutally attack her and this is exactly what had happened what is worth noting is that at the time his mother had actually been working on campus at UC Santa Cruz and this was important as because of all of the attacks that been going on all UC Santa Cruz students had been told you know don't trust people that you don't know father says like staff of UC Santa Cruz and they're trustworthy so try and only hitch I can only trust getting people's cars that maybe have that sticker but Kemper did have that sticker because his mum worked on the campus so obviously when he would offer these hitchhikers rides they thought they could trust him because he had this staff sticker so these two girls went had his car and he began to give him a lift when he at some point stopped the car told him to look at the beautiful view and as the pair turned he shot them both very suddenly inside his car just like his previous victims he placed the bodies in the boot of his car he then drove to a petrol station then his mother's house with the body still in the car and just like the previous cases he petted and molested the remains he disposed of the body parts in a number of different areas as a means of attempting to hide as much of the remains as possible life for Edmund didn't really seem to change much following this as he went back to his usual life living with his mother who he still really didn't get on where they still were constantly having arguments and these fantasies were still going on in his head but then about a month after these last he decided it was time for him to kill his mother she had to spend the evening out with her friends and so when she returned home she'd headed for her bed in the early hours of the morning Kemper had entered her bedroom and he later told investigators that she just looked up at him while she was lying in bed and said I suppose you want to talk now to which he replied that he didn't his method of choice had been a claw hammer and this is exactly what he had used to kill his mother following her death he did a number of unspeakable things to her remains including removing her head and sexually assaulting it he placed her head on a mantle and began just screaming out all these things that he thought about her and all these things that he'd never had the chance to say to her as well as throwing darts at her head like he did a lot of things these remains and it was at this point that he realized that people would know that he was the one to blame for his mother's death and so he decided that there was only one person that would notice if she which is just kind of go missing and this would be his mother's friend Sally Hallett so he decided that he would invite Sally Hallett over to house under the pretense that he was going to take her and his mother out for a dinner but when she arrived at the home he welcomed to him and then he punched her in the stomach and strangled her killing her as well he left her remains on the bed they spent the entire night in so he just spent the night with two sets of remains inside the house the next morning he left his house and he began driving Sally's car and he listened on the radio assuming that he would suddenly hear some sort of news report on these two bodies that were found of his mother and her friend but there were none and this planet is appointed when he'd made it as far as Colorado he'd become disappointed at the lack of news report and the lack of public attention that his crimes had gotten and so he decided to head straight for a phone booth he rang up the Santa Cruz Police Department and confessed that he had been the co-ed killer now at first initial dispatcher had believed it was a prank call so he had to actually ring up again and attempt to convince the police department that he was the man they were looking for finally he was told that they would be sending officers out to his location so that he was to stay on the phone with them so they could make sure that he was still there and then when the officers arrived at this particular phone booth that he was stood in they came face-to-face with this huge six foot nine Goliath of a man that was the co-ed killer he was obviously then questioned in detail about each of the crimes just to make sure they did actually have the right man and he was able to relate in extreme detail very very articulated in his recollection of each of the events but he gave a lot of detail on each of the individual crimes and at that point he was able to give details that the investigators themselves didn't know because they were a complete loss like they had no idea that this man had been the man they were not even close to being on it during tempis trial the defense team attempted to take an insanity plea to try and prove that and he wasn't really guilty of his crimes because he was not mentally sound however this was obviously something that they couldn't actually prove because he was very mentally sound if you ever watched clips if you do watch this documentary you'll see clips of him talking he is very intelligent and he's very aware of what he's doing and people always say like in these interviews and stuff that people have done with him they say that he's a very likable person but he's also very honest so he's a very very interesting character if you're interested in that sort of psychology of of serial killers and Psychopaths it's very fascinating to watch and the documentary itself Kemper on Kemper does a very very good job at delving into that part of his case so at the time he just didn't really fit into any of the boxes that they had or criteria they had to fit any of the mental health disorders or illnesses that they knew of at the time and it was like he was just something entirely different so they don't really know how to approach his case ultimately Edmund Kemper was sentenced to a life sentence on eight counts of first degree murder he became such a huge influence on the development of behavioral science techniques that are used today during his incarceration he worked very closely with the FBI to build their understanding of offenders like himself as well as some that aren't even anything like him but he was very helpful in a lot of ways because he just shared things and he explained things they went to him for advice on how they profiled such people and the sort of person there looking for if they were looking for a sign serial killer this documentary does a really good job at showing you how he helped the FBI and I definitely think it's worth the watch because it is fascinating to think that the FBI built their techniques on profiling serial killers and catching Psychopaths and things like that based on what a particular killer Edmund Kemper had told them it's fascinating so that is actually everything I'm going to go into detail with today because like I said I highly recommend you watch this documentary can put on Kemper but I said link down below but it's definitely worth the watch because honestly it's very very very well done I honestly can't price this one enough it kept me it kept me very interested I definitely love to hear your thoughts on it down below obviously there's a lot with this case it's a very very fascinating case and I can't go into too many of the details because a lot of the details are quite upsetting but I'm sure you get the gist and I'm sure you've a lot of you probably heard of Edmund Kemper before because he is a huge hugely influential person like I said in relation to the development of different techniques that we use today and they have helped our understanding of different offenders so let me know if you do watch the documentary it'd definitely be fascinate to hear you always his thoughts or what you thought of it because I thought it was definitely very interesting and thank you guys so much for watching please leave your case requests down description box and I'll see you guys very soon for another video thanks for watching bye
