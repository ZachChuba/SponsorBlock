the trailblazer league is over you can no longer log into the trailblazer worlds however i didn't get to finish telling my story and for those of you wondering why it's taken almost four weeks to get this video out you are seriously about to find out and i hope that some of you will cry along with me in the last episode we managed to get max total level in the trailblazer league as well as basically max gear and i said at the end now there's one thing left to do in this league i lied there was two things left to do the first one get the inquisitor's armour set and the inquisitor's mace the inquisitor's armor and mace which once belonged to fosani a turn-cloak sarah dominus justice shah from the third age fosani after consuming the elixir of everlasting entered her nightmare state and after she passed her armor and mace were moved deep into the sisterhood sanctuary which is where we're going to find them sponsoring today's video okay the plan is to camp a whole lot of nightmare we've got 45 mil in the inventory and i am in fact going to spend the entire lot on blood runes i'm going to spend 45 mil on blood runes so i can fill up the scythe fill up the sang stuff and uh we can just launch from there and there we go 100 000 blood runes i think i'm just gonna call it there um leave a little bit of money behind because i mean i don't think i have anything to spend money on but just in case i do 100 000 blonde runes is plenty we can stock the scythe right up how many charges would you like to add let's go 338 that is all of the blood runes inside this well let's go ahead and we want to charge the scythe charger scythe we can put 191 charges on it perfect so that is almost 20 000 charges and if we empty the via well yeah we still got 44 000 blood runes so what i'll do is just use the rest on the sang if i can yeah i can so the same still not fully charged but if we ever need the blood runes back we can just go ahead and uncharge the saying and i think i still actually have some in the bank the first kill oh i see that is 50kc here at the nightmare i'm gonna be mixing it up throughout these kills between duo's solos and the occasional trio i don't really want to have too many people in the team just because when there is a drop so much less likely that it'll be in my name and i want to just have as little uh deviation in terms of uh randomness as possible now for those of you that have never soloed the nightmare before here's how it goes the nightmare has three phases the three phases which i'm going to call the husk phase the parasite phase and the mushroom phase in phase one the husk phase the nightmare has two special attacks the first special attack being the husks when the husks come out you're frozen in place and guess what you've just got to kill them the second special attack is called flower power with flower power one corner of the room will be sectioned off and that is the corner of the room that you have to stand in or you're gonna take damage once you take down the nightmare's 2000 health the shield will come up and you can't attack the nightmare anymore and before you can attack the nightmare again you have to take down the four pillars in the corner of the room in a regular solo you would use magic against these pillars because magic does double damage however in the league you attack twice as fast with melee anyway or at least i do after you take down the pillars we're on to phase two the parasite phase in phase two there's two special attacks the first one being the parasite when the parasite comes out you have to drink a dose of sand fused serum or a realism's bomb after a few hits the parasite's gonna come out and you have to kill it before it heals the boss the second special attack is the prayer changer this is gonna make your magic prayer do range instead your ranged prayer do melee instead and your melee prone to magic instead and for someone as stupid as me this one is really [ __ ] confusing another pillow phase goes by and we enter phase three the mushroom phase in the mushroom phase there's two special attacks the first one being the mushrooms simple as this don't stand next to them they're gonna slow down your attacks and make you not able to run the second special attack is the skirt skirt this is where the nightmare is going to dip underground come up on one end of the room and scoot to the other side of the room if you happen to be in her line of sight you're going to take a huge bit of damage luckily in the league it doesn't really [ __ ] matter at all about any of these special attacks because i'm a drainer which means i can just sit there with my magic prayer on and hit the boss and never ever have to worry about eating and once you take down the boss in the league you've got a 1 in 33 chance of getting a drop just like this one no [ __ ] way the first drop we get is the most important one the first drop we get is the most important one the inquisitor is great home that makes my bandos armor just as good as void that is so [ __ ] unbelievably sick yes let's go and that's 250 league points for equipping a piece of the inquisitor's armor set this is sick holy [ __ ] okay that is my first sub 10 minute solo first time i've done a solo nightmare in less than 10 minutes 9 40. that is [ __ ] insane i think once i get the inquisitor's mace and the full set i might be able to push like eight minutes maybe seven i don't know either way it's gonna be [ __ ] quick man it's crazy how rare things are here at the nightmare compared to everywhere else in the league even with the drop rate multiplier 1 in 33 chance here at the nightmare to get any drop this marks kills today and it's taken me the whole day like i get six kills an hour here if i'm so low maybe five and if i'm drawing i get between 10 and 12. so i mean it's it's a long grind here at the nightmare but we're gonna get it done 132 kc for our second item here unfortunately it is a nightmare stuff it is the most common item so expecting to get a few of these over the course of the kills but that's a nice little 250 league points i'll take those up to four to eight five zero how did that happen by the way we're still not in dragon tier i think the next episode will be going for that dragon tier rank but there's a nice little nightmare stuff we're never ever gonna use this by the way it's completely and absolutely useless how much does it help for and it looks [ __ ] all too perfect oh no that's not good that that one is not good that is not boosted drop rates on the league and that is a one in 1900 drop oh man we weren't supposed to see one of these at all and i've just been called a skilling virgin in the [ __ ] pms i can't be asked i just put the nightmare stuff on to uh i don't know a little whack around as a joke and what the [ __ ] is going on look at this thing hey god i gotta make this full screen look at this [ __ ] this should be kill count number 150 for a mace nope for some blood runes well we'll take it we'll take it hey new fastest time there i got it with the uh hasta as well 934 i am 100 positive that a sub nine minute potentially even sub eight minutes possible with full inquisitor i'm keen to give it a crack i just need to get the drops so the game just updated and i'm currently playing on uh the vanilla client because rune light isn't up yet and i i just how did anybody play this game before gpu mode and animation smoothing like it just looks awful no [ __ ] way man no [ __ ] way that's a harmonized dog that's annoying because it's [ __ ] useless in the league and i've done so much nightmare in the main game oh my word i literally don't even get to use it it's useless the only thing it's good for is this that's 500 points well you know what we'll take it we'll take it and this is 200 nightmares that's the rate for six drops and so far we've seen three happening all over again guys it's happening all over again i wasn't recording when i noticed this little [ __ ] of a thing and i wish i was because if you guys could have heard my sigh like just it's just a sigh of uh of course you know anybody that's been watching me for a long time will know that i would much much prefer an item over a pet like i don't i don't really care having this little [ __ ] thing following me around oh and i've done 237 now probably 180 solos and i've had one [ __ ] piece of armor and now this little cunt's following me ah and that is 259 their kills man this is this is going to be the end of my league like this boss this will be the last thing i do in the league i i can't be asked anymore oh my [ __ ] god this is the best possible drop i could have gotten this is the best possible drop i could have gotten oh my god everything else that i'm looking for is like not rare at all like as in in terms of how rare everything is the top and the bottom of the inquisitor set are way less rare than this mace oh my [ __ ] god 264 nightmares and this is the fourth drop i've seen and i could not be happier holy [ __ ] and the back-to-back no back-to-back and look at that that was my first [ __ ] try and that was the fastest kill i've ever gotten by like 23 seconds oh this is gonna be so sick yo i didn't even notice because i was just chilling uh you know just hanging out killing a few nightmares but that is a sub nine solo i got an 855 solo nightmare kill ah yes another harmonized orb this is not good because i was gonna go back and do some more nightmare solos in the main game after the league and now i've had two harmonized orbs the odds of me ever seeing one again it's just zero let's [ __ ] go boys there we go another piece of the inquisitor set the plate skirt coming in just the plate body now and we're done with the nightmare oh that's so [ __ ] good the rng turning around one more piece let's go oh no man i had a feeling i was gonna get another drop tonight i had a feeling i was gonna get another one but i really thought it was gonna be the [ __ ] plate body ah another plate skirt that is the first dupe here at nightmare and it only alks for 450k on kill count 300 as well by kill count 300 going by the drop rate we should have seen four and a half pieces of justy and we've seen three so far so i mean we're still overdue not just the inquisitors still overdue for that plate body but hopefully it [ __ ] comes soon man oh my [ __ ] god that's it nightmare's done in 306 kc 96 kill count less than i was supposed to get this done in i actually [ __ ] got lucky somewhere i don't believe it the only other useful item we can get from here is the volatile orb that's 500 points for equipping a full set i am going to continue doing some more nightmare just because i want to go for some super fast times and now i can hit a 56 with the inquisitors set but holy [ __ ] we've done it this is the best dps in the league look at this [ __ ] we're just the bandos chest plate that's a 55 with the hawbercon 56. i wonder if it makes a difference for a bgs spec say it's on slash that's a 75 what about on smash that's a 77 holy [ __ ] boys let's go oh and how could i forget to mention the scythe on crush when it's on slash max hit is a 48-24-12 and now it is a 49-24-12 so we get an extra one max hit yo ladies and gents just quickly before we continue in the video i wanted to let you all know that we're no longer in lockdown here in australia and that means the vlogs are making a comeback i've already uploaded one you can find it on my other channel i'll leave a link in the description and there should be another vlog coming out in two or three days i'm super excited to start pumping these out there maybe a few less runescape videos because i've enjoyed them so much but make sure you check it out link in the description now i said there was two things we had left in this video the inquisitor's armor we've obtained and the last thing left to do is to finish tob we have every single item except for the justice shaft face guard it's a 1 in 86 chance to see a just a shot face guard and since we're in the league that means when i'm doing trios there's a one in 86 chance it's going to be in my name so far we've done over 300 kill count and obviously haven't had any in my name now for those of you wondering how you get a just a shower face card well you have to complete the theater of blood in the theater of blood you have to take on the maiden of sugan ds the pestilence scrote the nylocast facilisac scrotus seg zar [ __ ] and lady verzik if you manage to take down all of those bosses you get a chance at some loot in the league it's a one in three chance to see a purple chest just like this one james is yeah i was actually too all i need is a dusty face guard here it's the last item i need to finish top okay good luck oh i i really believe as well i really believe i need is the [ __ ] dusty face guard it's gotta be and there it is you deserve it

end my misery come on oh my god bruh i actually am at the point where i don't even get excited for purples anymore because i just know it's not going to be it and i'm going to have to do another one yep there it is nice nice another just the shower chest guard here not the helm um glad to see another jessie chest or an eventic defender hilt classic just just classic okay i said i don't get excited about purples anymore but this is actually a back to back to back in solos three purples in a row in three raids let's go it's not gonna be the justy helm but you know i swear to god it's four in a row four of ernie oh it's not even a vernick no purple i've only got veronica vernick another day another purple chest justine helm inside that's five of erniks in a row i actually want to [ __ ] punch it the hole in my monitor guys it's sad i know i know it's sad but today is christmas day the 25th of december and i mean this would be just be the the best christmas present ever i [ __ ] hate christmas man league purple number 57 for a 1 in 9.5 drop that is my twelfth [ __ ] my god are you kidding me league purple chest number 58 yup yup yup this is gonna be purple number 59 are you [ __ ] serious bro that's 13 leg cards 13 bro we're officially at the point of the trailblazer league where it's practically going to be impossible for me to get dragon rank i'm 6 000 points away from dragon rank at the moment and that was the goal of the league was to get dragon rank and i figured i should just finish off the justice set 565 tops and we haven't gotten the justice helm and there are 1575 more hits on my blood fury i don't have another blood shard in the bank and i am definitely not going back to get another one so if this blood fury runs out and i haven't gotten the justice helm i quit that's it i have to give up okay ladies and gents this is purple number 60. purple number 60 and as i've just told this handsome fella that's watched me do this raid this is it i am not doing another raid this is going to be the last purple i see in the league there's 900 hits left on the blood view but i i can't it's new year's eve today and i'm not starting the new year doing raids this is the last chest we open in the league is it going to be the justice helm number 60 it's not it is not and that's it that's the league over i'm done and i didn't get the justice helm look at my [ __ ] collection log man three scythes eight rapiers one staff four chest guards 13 legs 31 of wernicke defender hills and zero face guards so i think it's pretty safe to say that because of rng my league has been awful i did have a great time playing it but uh i'll tell you what i will not be playing the next one unless there's some sort of relic that stops you from going unbelievably dry on items i can't put myself through this again if you will allow me i would like to have a little whinge starting off with cerberus the only thing i wanted was the primordial crystal and it took me 282 kills in the league it's a 1 in 170 rate a hundred kills over the drop rate next up you better believe it was general garado from bandos i wanted everything however it took me 418 kills to get the bandos chess played in the league it's a 1 in 127 chance to get a bcp and it took me 400 kills next up we went to krill suzeroth in search of one thing and one thing only the zamarakian spear so that we could make a zami hasta in the league a zami spear is one in 42 and i had to kill krill suits roth 211 times i went almost two times the main game drop rate for a spear kriyara the armadill chest plate came in on 207 and much like the bcp it's a one in one two seven for the drop so although we didn't get crazy unlucky we still went 80 kills over the drop rate for the acp commander zilliana it's a one in 169 chance to get a sarah doman hilt and we had to kill 350. golovks experiments for zenites one in 100 for a zenite and 651 kills later we finish it off the nightmare of ashiyama i have absolutely nothing to complain about with this boss we got very lucky well not very lucky we got lucky with the boss okay thank god we got lucky with something in the league but the last one is tob and i just this is just honestly my brain is a mush after doing this many raids in the league and not even finishing it no pet no face guard nothing but sadness and sorrow the overall bank value at the end was 6.7 bill and i tell you what ladies and gents this is the reason i refuse to play iron man in the main game imagine just imagine i go to bandos and it takes me 1200 kills for a bcp and then i go to zami and it takes me 600 kills to get a sami spear and then i go to sarah and it takes me 950 kills to get an sgs i got armor and it's 600 kills for the armor and then i go to tob and i do 1500 raids and it's still not done i just could not put myself through that and like i said unless there's some sort of relic next time that stops you from going 3x the drop rate i can't this will be my last my first and last league i do hope ladies and gents that you have enjoyed the league content though it was fun playing it but if i could do it all over again i wouldn't i'll catch you guys in the next video take it easy
