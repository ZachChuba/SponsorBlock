oh there's my plane again right on cue hey guys doing let's see how this hammock work so I'm a little well crushed in here on the on the old log it'll pull let's see the toggle is gonna come in use again hold this Lantern onto my face swear it will look at that look at that and she works just fine as a chair my chair that I left here I'm gonna have to start um just taking this cross piece out and turning seats sideways so it doesn't pool because it's like water repellent material and it's there's a puddle in there I'm glad I brought this little hammock regardless I could sit on the on the bed I have my pad as well lots of sitting options right I hope you guys enjoyed the last installment of the fort we we didn't do too much building last time there's more I'm getting really real clean with the place poking up some food and talk a whole lot about flint and steel I didn't mean for that to go on so a long last time yeah we're back this is building day number four I've already got a few pieces back there are a few new logs ready to put up plan for today just gonna hang out for a bit drink this tea and then go cut a bunch of logs probably finish the wall today we don't here for a little bit so far yeah I do have a supper with me that'll cook out here after I'm done done building for the day last time you saw the tools I had I had my Hawk with me we got a couple comments about it some people like that some people didn't think it was very efficient and yeah I do like it and I think it's efficient enough but today I decided to bring a little bit of a different tool this is my council tool velvet cut I can't really the exact name of it but it's a maybe 20 to 23 inches long which is it nice in between like normally it's at a 19 inch or a 26 inch and this is a nice in-between I think this is the same size as the Les Stroud whirling Bushman axe yeah this is a nice axe is made in America it's got like a little wedge for splitting sharpest the dickens as well and nice and light and thin handle fin handle is one of my preferences on the axe it's gotta have a thin handle it's nice I do like it do everything with this so for like splitting huge logs I imagine even so you you can make splitting wedges and use it with this see it's made in the States little counsel tool logo on it nice wedge nice fit almost 5 exactly all right this is great that wind is kicking up like pretty good actually but I found a another tree that's been broken off hey Terry see the top of it's next to it so that's a good candidate for sure there's a really weird feel in the air right now as I sink to my knees and snow okay yeah there is like I don't know I got really quiet strange anyway let's get this tree maybe not all right well that's a decent amount of logs I'd say it's pretty good no cover a good distance on here maybe not all of it for right now I'm starving and I think I'm gonna get my food going and then clean these up and put them on the hill fort while I'm waiting I'm waiting for my food to cook I got some chili some dehydrated chili today some year-old dehydrated chili so I thought I'd better eat it old school camp and chili so I picked this grill up at Walmart it's not even a grill it's like a rack for your your kitchen likes to add an extra shelf and your cupboard or something so we'll see how it holds up I just like the size of it and the height really - it's perfect I'm gonna leave it out here I'll be my fourth part of my fourth year will you start leaving a few things out here but this will definitely be part of that so all I have right now is just some water in there I'm going to boil that up and then get that chili in there after that it's almost boiled up just gonna get a little bit more twigs on here oh that's the good stuff right there still smells good and everything two years old one year one year at least that's a hefty amount that was one of my double Joe days just gonna give that a quick stir don't mind the tea tea sport okay might be a little bit much on the water but we'll boil it out if that's the case then I can just even add little sticks a little bit at a time if I want this is all cedar I haven't really taken down any big firewood pieces today because it's not really cold I'm just using the fire for boiling up water and cooking food so I've been able to just get by with the little limbs that I have taken off the trees that I'm using to build with okay that'll give it a little bit of a flash-flame there up the ante for a second when I got all this stuff and well she's hot she's hot all right somebody's are getting long I'll fix that later on get in there I'll get in there keep getting caught on this there we go I'll show them who's boss there we go much better now much better it's a heavy one this is why I wanted that support pull some really heavy pieces here I might actually put this on the end because it's so much wider than the other ones put it here maybe actually I don't even need to go out that far this is where my four ends here and I could make sidewalls oh I got some caught Cooper I got so caught up and putting the final lugs on there Fred come check on this guy how you doing oh she's sizzling okay we gotta check this out oh that's looking good it is a little watery still so I'm gonna leave the lid off for the last little bit of it I believe it's all cooked I'll try piece of this meat here maybe a bean yeah these lima beans kidney beans what's the red ones kidney or lima oh it's done soft very soft okay like I said with that lid off there the a lot of moisture is gonna escape through steam so it will lose its wetness right technical terms anyways most of it so I can still always look so much better alright I can still put that last cut those last couple pieces on this is cool especially with the hammock in there but BAM Sun look at that look at that so very cool she's bent well she's quite bent yeah okay maybe we will put that out on the end this this one I guess I could afford to get a couple more still like this is what I was talking about this is the end here hurry there's the bed there's the end of the thing that's the end of the the length I need over here it's right to the tree because my bed starts right here but I could afford to get maybe two more here and then I'll start doing the wall up sideways to this this ridge pole is tied on and on the limb below it she's solid this is all solid very solid especially with that joist in the up and down piece oh yeah it's done finally sit down and eat I haven't had chili in a long time I don't have this dehydrated chili in a while I brought this as part of my demonstration for my talk at canoecopia then it was up in the top of my pack I said well mine is all eater hmm tastes like portaging so I always get how long did about Scout patches used to sell scope patches and stickers they're back on the bunker branding website polka branding calm and then go to influencers and yeah look at me and there's two-inch Scout logo like this patches they used to be three-inch these are 2 inch they look a little bit nicer on the 2 inch side and the embroidery is a little bit better the stitching and stuff it seems I have a couple of home I like them how you solve them for $20 Canadian shipped period there they're selling them for six bucks American so I don't know if they I think there's probably on top of that as well but when you're doing it by yourself like I was a few years ago cost everything is higher doing everything yourself smaller quantities you glide hooked up with those guys I they have a lot more resources and get things done quick which is cool I like dealing with them there's a few things on there if you guys haven't checked it out please these shirts these are a distressed logo it look like they're worn already hoodies shirts hats stickers all sorts of different stickers and mugs oh pretty soon we have my own titanium cup with a bail like this but smaller that nests a Nalgene will nest in it and it will have a handle like this but also a bail that comes over and a lid that titanium it'll be sweet and we're gonna sell them on the website as well now I don't have my logo all of this stuff to like I told you guys while back I do want to start selling camping gear actual stuff that we would use right as opposed to just merchandise in apparel let's go which is cool too but what's cooler than having your own camping gear type stuff so and useful and a good quality I've switched a titanium long time ago I'm a heavy cover canteen I still use all the time but this would be mine that'll be some price to a lot more coverage remember second time I came over here to build my camped out not only had me be up to like here done or something like that it snowed a bunch that night noble cup with snow all over my baby I'm glad I brought a baby baby is good for the winter time I don't tend to use it really much other than that but the winter it's nice to be key in that cocoon not not dogs but you know I'm so happy it's starting to get nice out and walk on top of the snow for the most part oh there's gonna be a rumble in the Bronx pretty soon look at how that snow is packed down now man got to bring my tarp up with me got it there the snow makes food bits inside a little bit frozen and you can kind of get rid of a lot of it that way before boiling it up it's pretty clean it's a little bit of food bits in there food booths the best kind of bits starting to cool down a bit so we are gonna build a back wall because I want this to be more of like a three-sided look Adirondack type shelter that you would see somewhere like the 80 like the Appalachian Trail or something three-sided open in the front and then also have like a roof coming off of it like I was kind of talking last time and then I was kind of mentioning that last time then people said make a back wall so you don't have to have it so straight up and it makes perfect sense you're exactly right so that's what we're gonna do the back wall will be probably higher it will be higher than the wall is now let's I'll show you as I'm talking here chilly so as it is now they're like gonna I don't know what that is 45 degree but I want to bring them up more like this so they're here and we want to bring them up maybe like this but up there so I have a bunch of room so obviously because the ridgepoles starting up there right so when they come down if I put on this much of an angle they're gonna be it's gonna like come up like this and stop there and then the ground will be this snow will be gone I'll be right to the ground so I have much more much more heads of head room already we'll put a flat back wall down on there maybe even make it a little bit cuz I can put a tarp on top of here I'm there I've never once said this is a bushcraft shelter I never once said I wanted to use all natural materials none of that fancy stuff this is a fort I'm gonna do what I want so I can put like like a Canadian Tire Walmart type brown tarp on there like a poly tarp that I don't care about and then it doesn't really matter the pitch cuz the pitch I always want my pitch to be steep because then it's that's how it sheds rain snow what have you melt but with the tarp all of that doesn't matter it negates the whole thing so have it way less steep back wall sidewalls that come straight out and then I might make them even longer to make like the front of it like like a half wall up you know what I mean so use the same ones to run long have that create like a wind barrier on either side I have a big ledge to stay away from the rain and then have two beds under here maybe I do like the idea of the hammock this worked out pretty well I'm gonna lay in there and drink this tea I can bring emerald here you know what I mean we can do like a camp here but anyways that's the idea so thank you for for the realization of the back wall of course the back wall it makes a hundred makes a hundred percent sense a hundred percent but yeah that's not to be for a while man oh yeah that only makes more sense because then when the snow is gone I build the back wall and then this is straight and I can just do a straight shot with the side wall boom on the left side of this cedar straight out square everything up have these come these will be way off the off the ridge ball forward and then I can even make a separate roof out there by tying large tripods or using forks forked logs hammering them into the ground and then putting out rafters lengthways line on top of there I could put a tarp up on top of there too but we do want space for the smoke to escape there's gonna be a decent size there's any a decent size once this is all squared off right like right so it comes over here a little bit more the side walls gonna pretty much follow where that cedar is on the ground out to here or maybe not so far maybe out to here build that up a couple feet same thing on the other side all closed in on the back oh man I'm actually really excited for this okay tea that's what we're doing shoes so I got my jade citrus mint tea good for my tummy taking her easy for a bet on the old tum tone Oh usually say tum tum no I did that welcome to my little baby too much I hear a chainsaw I think that's really weird I shouldn't shouldn't be hearing the chainsaw here alright pine needles and chili did sounds like a CD album pine needles and chill dank well I do have to say I'm impressed with this little grill it's no long / get a little melty and bendy but I love the height very stable mmm that doesn't taste that good with all the chili water oh yeah I know this is totally fine there's nothing wrong with this I was thinking like the the trees were too close together and this is gonna be too saggy and then when I was laying that way I was bouncing off this the center pole quite a bit but this this way is totally fine it feels real nice on the back actually the back actually the book actually some book actually yep it is cooling down for sure you can really feel it when you lay in a hammock that convection whipping the warmth right away from the backside nobody wants a cold butt so this is pretty good for four days of building look I've definitely done this in a day but on a smaller scale but that's not the point here and there was not this much snow to have to dig down and all that - that was a big part of it I forgot about that part yeah but yeah I like having a work in progress that's how I kind of did my last bushcraft camp there when I tore down I'm just gonna chill out here for a little bit I'll get back with you guys so for next time so my seats not wet it's got this easy to undo a Canadian Jam slide it out just once I don't know the best way to do this I just don't want it pooling water right like it's sitting like a seat is pooling water so maybe I'll flip it upside down wrap it tight to the pole I could even use this paracord to cinch it down paracord that was already on there that seems like it'll work out okay for ticket back wall is complete we have finished the back wall finally let's test its integrity not too shabby hey guys it's parkour Joe here check it out I'm carrying scout with me at all times simply subscriber had this made for me years ago and I have no idea the name of the person anymore just so long ago I hopes to go on a baby ago and a dog ago but I appreciate it if you're still watching thank you so much and I keep this guy on me all the time now it's my scoots my boots on my side made of like super dense wood carved I believe I believe I miss some I miss my buddy you never got to come over here snow is too deep she is it'll look so much better when all those are uniform sides on it but it's pretty decent size I'm really happy with it four days of work let's digging it out like I said earlier you curious if the ground will be always like a divot there or if the rest of the ground get packed down thanks for coming along again hope you enjoyed it we'll be back soon next video should be I can't do it Doug video will be around we'll be getting videos out regardless go check
