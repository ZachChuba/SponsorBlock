hey guys welcome back to my channel in today's video I'm gonna be showing you how to make your very own mirror in living room table set since you guys really loved the last one that my husband and I made during our mirrored furniture series we wanted to make another set to show you how easy it is to update any furniture piece you have with simply adding mirrors if you haven't seen our previous videos for the mirrored furniture series I will leave them linked below in the description box a big thank you to shop tiger for enjoy it if you haven't already I purchased this TV table cart from Walmart for $29.99 I thought it would work perfect for a small living room space and there are wheels at the bottom that can lock so it stays in place this set is actually going to be a gifts for a family that just moved here from out of the states they don't have a lot of things in there in a very small home I know buying married furniture pieces can get pricey so I hope this video encourages you to update any furniture on a budget and if you have a small space this set would be a great and affordable option for you to glam up your home we built the table and then measured the top sides and inside to add mere [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the mirror we always have cut is from Lowe's they have a small section in their store for glass and mirror cutting they will cut it for you for free if you purchase their glass or mirror I will leave all the measurements for the mir in the description box this is my go to a gorilla construction adhesive because of how strong it is and the mirrors don't go anywhere I applied a good amount of glue in to added the mirrors on top throughout each side [Music] [Music] it was late when we got to Lowe's they were about to close and we had to get the mirror cut so we forgot to grab the thin sticks that go around the mirror edges adding the thin sticks will make it safer to have the mirrored table around if there are children or even yourself because of the sharp edges if you make this DIY I highly recommend adding the thin sticks around because they're super easy to cut and all you have to do is glue them around the mirrors so you can find them at Lowe's and they're really inexpensive this is how the living room table turned out you can really use this piece anywhere in your home link the entryway where you take your shoes off or in the bathroom for extra storage there are many ways you can customize this to your own liking if you don't decorate with silver you can spray paint the edges gold or add wallpaper in the inside to give it a different look like marble or metallic silver paper you can even add more mirror it's all up to you use this as inspiration to update any furniture that you have been wanting to get rid of or want a different look for it will save you a lot of money if you know someone who loves smeared furniture but just can't afford it then this is a really nice way to surprise them and gift it to them I would love for you to send me pictures to see how you recreate this DIY or update any other furniture you can tag me on instagram at LG queen home decor [Music] here's a quick view of the mirrored table set I really like the way they look in the size of them because it even looks nice in my living room the finishing touches are always adding decor on top which is my favorite thing to do in style them I will try to leave all the links to the decor items you see here and I'm really excited that I found the link to my new candle holder this piece can be used all year long and what I love about it is that it adds coziness because of the candles inside even though it's a glam decor item these are the pieces for this side table I'm using for the living room even though it's the nightstand I went ahead and built it and spray painted the edges as you can see I will be placing mirror on top covering the entire side so my main focus was covering the sides with spray paint my husband helped me with the finishing table and added glue to the back of the mirror and applied it to the table he covered all of the sides except for the inside because I liked the look of silver spray paint instead this yeah I was very easy to get done the longest part was building the tables but following the directions help me to save time instead of figuring it out like I always tend to do the inside drawer is pretty spacious to store things and I like how it has a space at the bottom tad books decorative boxes or rolled-up blankets I hope you guys enjoyed today's video I'm really excited about adding the sticks around the mirrors have this set complete and ready to give to the family in need also don't forget to download shop tiger the link is in my description box
