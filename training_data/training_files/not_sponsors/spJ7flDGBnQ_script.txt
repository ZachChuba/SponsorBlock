company man or text company man - 500 500 did you know that baskin-robbins claims to be the world's largest chain of ice cream shops and I believe them there's over 8000 of them all around the world that serve 300 million customers each year they've said that they have a 92% aidid brand awareness in the US and meaning that just about everybody watching this should know about them right do you know the logo you know I have to talk about the logo it's incredible I hesitate to say it's the cleverest logo I've ever seen but I think it may be one of my favorites if you haven't caught on to what's going on here the curvy part of the B forms a 3 and the straight part of the R forms a 1 to make those parts pink and the rest of it blue and when you take away the blue what you're left with the pink 31 I know I think we may have witnessed a miracle here nobody had this in mind when naming the place or coming up with a 31 flavors thing that's what the 31 is they're famously known for their 31 flavors more on that later yet when you put a be next to an art it makes a 31 which doesn't work with any other combination of letters everything just came together here can you believe that I can still remember the first time I saw it I don't know I just thought I'd share that because they made that change back in 2006 and Here I am years later still thinking about it I think about it every time I see it meaning at the Baskin Robbins 2006 logo change is somehow one of the more memorable moments of my life the real question is how did it take them until 2006 to do this when you have a miracle on your hands if you don't wait 59 years to feature it and I have a theory but first let's go back and take a look at Baskin Robbins the name of it comes from the last names of Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins two people that really seemed like they were meant to be in business together Burt Baskin learned about ice cream while he was in the US Navy stationed in the South Pacific during World War two these were strange circumstances but he somehow obtained some equipment and started making ice cream for the other soldiers even got a little experimental with it when he started utilizing some of the tropical fruits that he found in the area after the war he wanted to continue with the ice cream business so he opened up his own parlor in California now Irv Robbins had been in the ice cream business his entire life going back to when he was a teenager in the 1930s his father had a store and he managed the ice cream counter that was contained inside of it it was a creative person - always looking to make something different at the time it would have been incredibly difficult to find an ice cream flavor that wasn't vanilla or chocolate it may be strawberry but Irv Robbins was creatively branching out and taking it upon himself to create some new flavors he too entered the military during World War two it was the US Army it took him away from the industry for a while but as soon as he returned he took three thousand dollars that he had saved up cashed out a three thousand dollar insurance policy that he had received for his Bar Mitzvah and used the six thousand dollars to open his own ice cream parlor in California now these are incredibly similar stories don't you think they took slightly different paths but ended up in the exact same position of both of them now attempting to run their own ice cream business they were even alike in the way that they were unlike everyone else I'm talking about the creative new ice cream flavors at a time where that kind of thing was mostly unheard of here were two separate people both making it happen doesn't it just seem like they should team up and put together their talents if they were to do so they could really stand out and shake up the industry well luckily they did have a connection that I view as yet another miracle during his time in the military Burt Baskin had married Shirley Robbins who was Irv Robbins sister making them brother-in-law's my gosh they'd spent about three years running their businesses independently building them to a combined to eight locations and now in 1948 decided to logically merge it all together and call the new combined company Baskin and Robbins they actually flipped a coin to determine the order of the names so think about that had that coin landed the other way we may all know them as Robbins Baskin which does not sound right to me and more importantly it would not have with this logo of course their combined business was a big success their unique flavors was the biggest thing that set them apart from the competition along with their relaxed environments and just general passion for what they were doing you may have noticed that both Baskin and Robbins were really into ice cream but not as much into business and management so after a couple of years when things were getting a little overwhelming and they figured out a way to continue growing the business while distancing themselves from that end of things the idea was that they would have some other aspiring business owners open and operate new locations while simply paying them a licensing fee to use their name in their products the setup was essentially what we call franchising Baskin Robbins is thought to be one of the first ever companies to use the franchising model in a big way and the first ever to do it in the ice cream business they were so pioneering with it do you know Ray Kroc I don't want to get too sidetracked here but it's worth mentioning that he sold these machines to blend milkshakes to Baskin Robbins and it's believed that's where he got the idea in inspiration to do some big things over at McDonald's what I'm saying is we may not have McDonald's today if it wasn't for Baskin Robbins in this business model that they pioneered in 1953 they came up with a bit of a gimmick to promote their wide selection of flavors they advertised that they had 31 flavors and how that meant that you can go in and get an ice cream every day for a whole month without ever repeating a flavor so now they had this revolutionary new model that made it easy for the brand to grow and expand along with an unheard-of selection of flavors and an effective way to promote that selection just about everything to this point has been almost too good to be true and it's about to take a turn in 1967 on Christmas Eve of all days Burt Baskin had a heart attack and died at the age of 54 he was said to be 240 pounds and many people including members of his family believed it that his love of ice cream played a big part in it obviously something like this would shake things up at the company but this was amplified see the remaining owner Irv Robbins had a son named John Robbins who is actually a best-selling author of books promoting a healthy lifestyle his most famous one being die for a new America he did not approve of his father's business and honestly wanted no part of it the combination of everything motivated Irv Robbins to sell the company the following year the estimated sales price was 12 million dollars that included almost 500 locations in 31 states 31 states okay Irv Robbins did stay on as chairman of the board for about a decade before leaving the company entirely from here there were a few changes of ownership I'll just give a quick overview that initial buyer in 1967 was United foods a large incredibly controversial company but they didn't own it for long in 1973 they were bought by a large UK based company called Allied Domecq that same company allied domecq bought Dunkin Donuts in 1989 and placed the two into their own segment that was later renamed Dunkin Brands in 2004 and then there were a few other changes that followed involving private equity firms that ultimately led to Dunkin Brands being publicly owned on the stock market in 2011 and that's where they are today looking at them in recent times over the last decade or so I wouldn't say they're doing great in the US anyway look at this for a number of US locations they closed quite a few of them from 2007 to 2012 they were actually shrinking then they started opening new ones again without quite getting back to that same level when looking at comparable store sales for the US it tells a very similar story they started coming back a bit right around 2012 to 2014 and here's what I think happened Baskin Robbins is I think we can all agree is an old brand and historically the biggest difference between them in their competition was their variety 31 flavors was their big gimmick and it simply doesn't matter like it used to there's no one out there having trouble finding a variety of ice cream flavors anymore we've all come to expect it oh and that was my theory by the way as to why it took them so long to hide the 31 into their logo in the past they wanted to be sure that you saw the 31 it was important that it stood out but now who cares it doesn't mean much anymore so might as well just hide it but anyway it looks like right around 2014 they stopped relying on the Republic awareness and existing campaigns that had become ineffective and started putting more effort into new approaches notably that was the year that they made this big licensing deal with Dean Foods to have their ice cream in the supermarkets in addition to multiple promotional movie tie-ins such as the amazing spider-man 2 released in 2014 and ant-man released in 2015 I would call that a significant comeback but the real story here is internationally let me take that Us locations graph from before and add in the locations from the rest of the world over this range their US presence has gone down while it's almost doubled outside of the US as I said in the very beginning they have over 8,000 locations but only 2,500 of those are in the u.s. moving on to their system-wide sales it shows almost the exact same thing but then let's look at even the bigger picture Baskin Robbins is completely franchised the same thing goes for Dunkin Donuts so all the revenue that they receive is through royalties and advertising fees and things like that not from the direct sales of ice cream or donuts well only 4% of their total revenue comes from Baskin Robbins Us locations it's up to 13% if you include international and even more and when you start dealing with the advertising funds but we can clearly see what's most important to their business you know I would think what's most important would be where they're more likely to invest let me know in the comments what do you think about Baskin Robbins I'd say as a business they're hanging in there alright maybe a little past their prime but that's no reason why we shouldn't respect what they've done in the past we have two men that followed their passion and in doing so helped shape the ice cream industry and arguably the entire fast-food industry with their iconic 31 flavors and they were franchising back in the early 1950s who else was doing that so any thoughts you have about the ice cream the business or the people involved throughout the years leave them in the comments I'd like to hear what you have to say audible is today's 500 one more thing before I go company man ideas dot-com it's the best way to submit a new video idea and vote on the one submitted by others that's where this idea came from and I took a screenshot from when I decided to make this video 31 votes I'll just leave it at that thank you for watching [Music]
