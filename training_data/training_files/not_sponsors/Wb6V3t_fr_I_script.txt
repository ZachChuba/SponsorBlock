even mean right now so go stop by and then enjoy the video before I elaborate on the topic of a villain I'm going to teach you about evil evil is an extremely broad concept that's described as the opposite of good which is an equally broad concept from my perspective after a lot of research on the subject evil isn't something you should use to describe someone now your first thought looking at a villain is to say well that is an evil person but evil as the opposite of good is an action some people would call these actions sins but at the core of every biblical sin even beyond the actions intent is the outcome evil is an action taken that puts those around you in a state of tribulation now any hero can make a good or evil choice and an action can indirectly decide the fate of all those around them I'd argue that everyone misunderstands evil due to the theory of indeterminacy just like light and dark one can't exist without the other people who endure the tribulations better understand the contrast and become a paragon of what they perceive well let's that's the end of my philosophical essay on evil les les bill a villain step1 to divert your expectations is to make a hero a strong idealist who believes in all the good the world has to offer but has suffered little to no tribulations yet I wrote a screenplay a couple years ago that I didn't do anything with it's a good example to use the first of my heroes is a scientist James Hinton the second is a war hero alan wilson and the third is a businessman winston man drago as part of this step describe your hero's ideals their ambitions and what motivates them James Hinton is a genius experimental physicist he values innovation creation and freedom I initially based him on myself his current ambition is to create dimensional portals a debunked field of what peers would call pseudoscience his motivator is fear fear is the most valuable emotion that humans have and the most common drive be it a fear of failure of the unknown death isolation or one of its other many angles the best among us are driven to learn so they find solace from their fears Allen values altruism companionship and family his ambitions are to meet his father's expectations of adding good to the world and his motivator at this time is also a fear of disappointing those that he values lastly we have Winston he values power intelligence and wealth to fuel the world's future his ambitions are somewhat self-centered but you can't really blame him he has a vision for a better world and is confident that only he can shepherd its arrival his motivator is slightly more unique as it isn't centered on the unknown he has hope a hope for the world to improve its own bounties so that suffering war and starvation come to an end respectable people with righteous ambitions now let's completely [ __ ] them up with cause and effect sometimes evil surface is not from actions but from probability the most common causes of evil actions are mental dispositions jealousy desperation insecurity selfishness and most types of fear now to really make a villain we need at least one of the following things to happen have their number of evil deeds be greater than that of their good deeds most villains like this have the ends justify the means mentality have one greatly evil deed overshadow all others spread a rumor that tarnishes their name forcing them to act on insecurities overwhelm them with jealousy or desperation or amplify their selfish indulgences you'll notice before I twist my subjects that they have the same goals as your average party that's my lesson in this video if you haven't caught on there's no such thing as a villain or an evil person but regardless let's start with mr. Hinton due to his research being more or less debunked he faces failure at nearly every turn terrified of failure deeply in debt with nowhere to turn he becomes overwhelmed with desperation this is his first snap to cope with loneliness and amplify his fear he develops minor schizophrenia and begins to lose touch with reality as the story would progress this mental twist allows him to make real strides in his research and earn a large grant from his friend Allen a little note here the more entwined your heroes are with your villains the more fulfilling the conflict often times both the heroes and the villains will have identical goals which makes them butting heads a lot more realistic after isolating himself to complete his research James completely loses humanity his reasoning would be something along the lines of if no one appreciates my work and they all lived to mock me why should I even consider them this is his final snap by far the most important angle in a villain is their misunderstanding of the world reaching one wrong conclusion about the world alienates you from the truth and greatly shifts your moral compass before we analyze his current greatly evil actions and plans let's look at our other victims of author force tragedy Winston is a visionary on par with people like Elon Musk or Bill Gates who sees what the world can gain and actively tries to provide it but his overwhelming awareness of his short mortal life is the crux of his eventual snap a man with such a powerful vision can't afford to lose even a second of time or money incidentally he turns away James's pozole for an absurd field of science now indirectly this is his first snap after hearing about Hinton success he's overwhelmed with the regret of not funding it and owning the patent this is another important note as people can be brought to take dark actions not out of desperation but also regrets I'll describe his first insurmountably evil action in just a moment let's move on to my third hero Alan Alan is a recently returned hero of war whose wealthy father recently passed away hoping to help the world but not knowing how he offers his inheritance to an old friend James his actions for now are nothing but loving kind and humble he builds a new life a family and a company of his own this right here is what can easily lead someone down the path of evil having so much to be grateful for is the same as having so much to lose Winston sees Alan as a threat to his plans for the future an encroaching evil person who might shape the world in a different way his selfishness eventually becomes his downfall as Winston lashes out in desperation in an attempt to eliminate the competition and drop the funding he destroys everything Alan owns Alan at this point is our most tragic villain and some could see him as an antihero but as I said before there's no such thing as a villain or a hero or an antihero just people living lives and doing what they think is right losing the entire world provides Alan with a motivator I've kept hidden from you until now revenge any good man can be vengeful if he loses his future keep that in mind just in general his life turns into a vigilante style assault on Winston's Way of life Winston begins funding our twisted friend who's sequestered himself from the world to finish his project to keep his attack on Alan a secret and avoid more issues Winston takes increasingly evil actions to save his own face you could say from his perspective the ends justify the means I might have lost some of you telling a story as opposed to giving bullet points but now we have three perfectly crafted men who act evilly without hesitation from my point of view there are three details you need to truly understand where these people are now how far they'll go when they'll stop and how they further their plans to answer the first prompt ask yourself what your villain values what do they have to lose if anything are they swarmed by something on their own accord let's look at Winston to answer this he's become somewhat of a Machiavellian and is very adapted manipulating others for personal gain so he doesn't value relationships he's lost sight of his generosity as it's been clouded by fear fear of losing his wealth and his name no matter what he'll sacrifice anything but how people perceive him and his investment in James to answer the second prompt let's look at Alan he has one emotionally blinded goal destroy Winston's reputation and then kill him my favorite thing about this particular type of progression is once he's finally done Alan risks becoming identical to the person he hates hunting monsters can turn a weak soul into a monster and someone with a vengeance is the perfect candidate and the last detail for any villain which is the most important thing for telling your story is how they achieved their goal this is generally the only thing most people actually write I'll use my crippled and shattered soul in mind James Hinton the most powerful social influence when understanding a villain is communication Hinton has none of that and that makes him more terrifying than any evil overlord he's no longer human he's an isolated host of demons that are amplified by his fears in order to fuel his research he needs living subjects a complete lack of ethics and insomnia delirium becomes both his only friend and his deadliest enemy initially the only external effect he has a random disappearances and kidnappings in the local area as a slave to his fears his research and his demon he becomes more and more unpredictable and monstrous eventually he could risk psychopathic outrages attacking people with powerful advanced weapons simply as a disillusioned form of revenge for all the rejection he faced anyone can become a villain all it takes is a little tribulation you
