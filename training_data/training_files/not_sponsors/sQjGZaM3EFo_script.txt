in the description to get yourself two months of Skillshare premium free Time magazine called Lord one of the most influential teenagers in the world and five years ago royal SATA top of the Billboard Hot 100 overtaking artists like Katy Perry Miley Cyrus Lady Gaga and Britney Spears some of the most prominent female pop artists of the late 2000s royal sounded nothing like its competition breaking all of the rules with a significantly slower tempo unique melodic structure and Lorde subdued vocals her style would mark a shift in the pop landscape delivering a voice with substance among what Dave Grohl considers stripper pop when Lord arrived on the airwaves pop radio would never be the same and that might sound like an exaggeration until you listen a little closer this is how Lords Royals changed pop music Ella yella Co Conner was born in 1996 in Auckland New Zealand her mother was a poet who encouraged her to read a wide range of genres it's an attribute that continues to assist her in her songwriting but it was universal music group that would be her greatest blessing the mega label would take notice of the young singer after seeing footage of her performing at her school's annual talent show they offered the then twelve-year-old Ella a development deal to further hone her skills and have her develop an idea of the kind of music she wanted to create they had ello working with a vocal coach twice a week for a year while attempting to set her up with a number of singers songwriters and producers to begin producing music with but with little success Ella took the moniker of Lorde and began writing her own songs in the meantime when she was paired with fellow Kiwi Joel little the two completed the five song EP the love club within just a few weeks it included Royals attract Lorde claims to have written in 30 minutes in it she criticizes mainstream pop culture a refreshingly original and mature take from a 16 year old featuring both uplifting and rebellious themes Royals was officially released in the summer of 2013 in support of Lords forthcoming debut Pere heroin a handful of months later the song took the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 making Lord the youngest artist in 26 years to top those charts she was 17 she also became the first female in 17 years to top the male-dominated alternative songs trunk the track went on to win two Grammy Awards including song of the year and the single has since been certified diamond in the u.s. selling 10 million units making it one of the best-selling singles of all time so what was all the hype about some of it had to do with style at 85 beats per minute Royals tempo was significantly slower than most female pop songs since Royals songs have also started to slow down and sound sad it may be a sign of the times but it's become the norm 87% of 2017 and number-one songs were in a minor key it's not really a song you can dance to it's more personal than that like it's meant to be heard on headphones not only was it a new sound but it was a social critique on the avant-garde lifestyles that were portrayed in most pop songs at the time compared to those other tracks the production on Royals is not nearly as polished or glamorous either opting for a more minimalist approach it's almost an acapella with its sparse synth driven and hip-hop inspired production that's also where things get more interesting royal uses the melodic structure called mixolydian mode it's a scale more commonly used in blues and alternative rock tracks it's what separates her songs for a most radio pop since it manipulates the feelings associated with major or minor chords making it sound neither happy nor sad this is the typical D major scale now this is the D mixolydian scale used in Royals it's like the major scale except it has a flattened 7th note the Beatles and the Grateful Dead both loved using mixolydian inverses and souls respectively Kurt Cobain used mixolydian in Nirvana's all apologies in a made a song about suicide almost feel like a triumph Lord songwriting becomes so much more when coupled with mixolydian mode just like mixolydian it doesn't fit one emotion it sits between this middle ground of excitement and passiveness her tone comes off both sarcastic and confident lourdes writes all of her music vocally she doesn't play any instruments on her records or on stage her voice is her instrument it's the Alpha and Omega of her talent it's been described as sultry smoky mystifying restrained and a thousand other adjectives suffice to say it's unique and powerfully intriguing which spawned record labels to begin creating clones of her you see pop vocal styles shift in and out of fashion all the time and when something original comes around there are always imitators and that argue that Lana Del Rey might have started the whisper pop breath heinous phase of this decade but it was Lords authentic songwriting that also had executives take notice she ushered in a new era of vocalists Selena Gomez Halsey daya Chiara Alessia Cara Melanie Martinez Troye Sivan banks all flooded in post Royals and looking back now it's hard to believe this conversational style wasn't around back in the 2000s Lady Gaga Ke$ha ariana grande Katy Perry Taylor Swift they all project their voices going for a full-bodied over-the-top sound and while there's nothing wrong with that there was just no balance this teenager helped steer pop vocals into an entirely new direction by refusing to appeal to mainstream tastes the dry sounds of her whisper singing is attractive it's intimate sexy and heartbreaking vocals with purpose really stand out and the focus is now on expressive storytelling rather than the American Idol style of singing maybe were attracted to music that sounds like it's meant for one set of years one interaction in this social network dense smartphone era of today making Lord appear heroine of the pop genre all skills and
