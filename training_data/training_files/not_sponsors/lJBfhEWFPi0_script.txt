hello friends and welcome to another video so usually on this channel we go to strange parts of tumblr but recently I found myself on a strange side of Pinterest and it made me feel a type of way so today I'm going to share with you what would you even call it relatable teens starter packs sort of thing I know starter packs are like I've seen them around the internet in the past but I had no idea that there was there such a wealth of them on Pinterest and that they all look exactly the same also I know I'm gesturing like this and I'm gonna have to explain my screen saver but it's this cat but before we get into which will be around and back to the video all right let's start with a pretty simple one here popular girls at my school asterisks always hooking up with guys so she wears clothes and shoes and she vapes and has a probably a stalker because that's a concerning about two text messages this is the girl I want to be self-care clear skin actually awake at school acrylics love to be a person in the world who wears clothes and shoes and deeds cucumbers yogurt I think that's you what would you call this aesthetic I don't know man that's the person who exists I'm just like I feel like there is a science to this that I need to decipher why how do we assign meaning to different lipgloss brands you know what I mean Oh Scorpio as a person independent sad TM has really good music taste I can see who is texting you I can see straight through you I'm only somewhat called out by this I sure as heck don't listen to the Beatles and then call it has really good music taste but I am guilty of wearing black I'm wearing my merch today but it is black speaking of which I have March you can wear it on your body it's this sweater is really comfy and warm and I am freezing my ass off in my apartment today because it's negative ten degrees outside unmotivated teen who only leaves their house for school oh god the caption is after watching Shane's news video I'm questioning everything is everyone I go a sociopath no that was just bad psychology ways to make a bad day better put on chapstick listen to your favorite bops reorganize your school supplies room desk etc drink h2o please just a little sodium chloride I'm supposed to take a nap and get enough sleep go out and spend time in nature go get a smoothie Bowl do a face mask spend time with my friends all in one day that sounds stressful okay that sounds like a lot of work new year better me I'm gonna focus on school tell people I love them what does that have to do with what is that lip gloss I'm a hip teen I know things the popular girl in middle school we all wanted to be and hated you're trying to tell me that this girl was in middle school that is not who I wanted to be in middle school I just wanted to wear these really ugly fishnet gloves I got from Claire's but my mom wouldn't let me because she thought it was a fetish thing that's who I wanted to be in middle school what I thought I'd be like at 15 oh god that's kind of sad know how to do makeup have a boyfriend lots of parties lots of friends pretty somehow I got an ad for new Kidz Bop album okay the girl I want to be I'm getting a really good idea of what basic is to kids these days if I was a youtuber okay always vlogging and hashtag vlogmas oh boy we're off to a start always collabing room tours free meet and greets new videos every week listen don't call me out like this my upload schedule has been bad and we all know okay makeup tutorials DIYs always have my dog in my videos hang up these oh the plaques the these plural implies that you have over a million subscribers so good job I I'm gonna peasant with my one lowly plaque which I don't even keep in my room trends that I actually like and have interest in excuse me young child is that a cigarettes it's markers i but to be fair i don't know what the kids are smoking these days who i am versus who i want to be kind of lazy [ __ ] what the [ __ ] i don't like coffee peachy feelings edge your style keep up with journaling drink more water i mean this is the first one of these that i can actually kind of relate to after a breakup starter pack reminder stop thinking about him he's not thinking about you broken trust a license plate that says i am sad she eats food she wears shirts no pants though i guess it's more of an ass out kind of looks I mean you do you everyone copes with breakups differently September as a teen [ __ ] you I need food I mean no [ __ ] I'm not trying to pull some like [ __ ] shaming teenage girls thing I think these are these are harmless and funny I'm just fascinated by them because I don't know anyone who is in high school anymore so I'm disconnected from this whole world and obviously I know this isn't any sort of like genuine representation of what it's like in high school it's it's the idealized version it's what's trendy it's what kids aspire to be and I find that interesting as well this one just says what I have become she's got clothes she has keys and bomb in her pocket and 20 bucks it's the pills that get me though there's there's an implication that this is antidepressants or something like that because I have found a lot of these have to do with like the sort of I want to die Jen's II kind of humor when I like to procrastinate I like to write nothing matters in giant letters across my notes then do some laundry chug a gallon of milk and eat some ramen this one just says what do you do with a broken heart once the light fades everything is dark it's just a picture of various beige articles of clothing what is this mean tell me trendy young people what the [ __ ] is this mean trying to be less of a mess mentally and in regards to my appearance okay a lot of these are very like they acknowledge the fact that they're aspirational and they're very self-care focused it just it is a little bit counterproductive that self care has so much to do with buying certain products and certain brands and looking a certain way and not you know be just being nice to yourself on a daily basis I don't know this is such a weird obscure strange part of Pinterest I don't actually think that anybody thinks like this or I'm sure some people do but I'm not like this is a plague amongst our children um you know I didn't even really know what was hip with the teens when I was a teen because I went to a school with like 200 students run by nuns and also I was even within that school was kind of a weirdo who only talked to four people so naturally I knew a lot about what was going on on tumblr me at school I bring my own lunch well I actually did pull a like a thing that I feel like someone who makes these would I bought myself this cute little bento box to try and motivate myself to pack decent lunches for school and instead of like just a weird assortment of snacks thrown into the bottom of my backpack you know um but that doesn't always happen considering that I am sitting here filming video instead of getting ready for class along with lip balm and clothes and eating food like being lazy and depressed seems to be pretty trendy right now and I mean that's concerning but it's something that I definitely more familiar with I think it affects the college age group that I am in right now a lot as well morning routine wake up have some coffee put on a mediocre outfit be on my phone oh it's the ones like this where I'm like what why did somebody make this why celebrate the aesthetic of being a normal person who wakes up this is what I look like at school if you wanted to know crying listening to music drinking out of that water bottle that is trendy wearing clothes and shoes that is probably a thing that you should do at school these are the ones I understand a little bit more because it's like these are clearly defined aesthetics and it kind of has the same appeal of like those like personality test sort of things or it's just like that's me but so these I get more it's the ones that are just like this is how I feel when I cry at 3:00 a.m. that concerned me slightly trendy teen versus relatable team there's a difference now thrifty Styles skin care full face everyday Hydra flasks that's what it's called photogenic so there's the difference between trendy and relatable being photogenic is the least relatable thing I've ever heard in my life can't reproduce exactly the weird hole that I fell down when I first started looking at these but there was one that was all about like chequered stuff being really trendy I wore my checkered pants in attempt to be a hip teen I'm honestly really happy to see like parts that cut parts of emo style come back as like a girl style or even trendy style checkered pants are in fashion My Chemical Romance is coming back 2020 is gonna be a phenomenal year change my mind which one is your side right or left I have a very hard time believing that these are mutually exclusive they're the same picture it's usually those days where you just don't care it is okay to be an actual disorganized mess who doesn't need an aesthetic for being a disorganized mess that kind of defeats the purpose of accepting that sometimes ya ain't cute I feel like I have been educated on teen culture on this fine day feel free to tell me that I am completely wrong and explain teen culture to me
