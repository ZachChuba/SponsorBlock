make your next move with Squarespace you know those people who just can't let people like things for some reason it's just not in their nature they might have a problem with the music you like what are you listening to Taylor Swift some witty comment about how many boyfriends she's had or something or maybe a movie you enjoy well how can you enjoy superhero movies they're not even movies they're corporate products made for billions of dollars well except for the films of Christopher Nolan of course those are masterpieces Master pie well maybe it's just a hobby some role in it didn't thing that you enjoy doing what's going on here oh I'm just taking some pictures to put up on my blog Oh a blog that's cool why does every white girl in their 20s have a blog witty condescending hashtag I'm just so fascinated by these people like what what happened that made them so resistant to the idea of people just enjoying the things they enjoy what makes them feel like they have to be the policemen of good taste am i hearing Wandy over here in 2017 I'm sorry it just makes me feel like it looks like we have a taste crime on our hand we need to makuu stick folk music over here this dad honestly how sad of a person do you have to be to want to make fun of people for things they like like who aren't you you know what son I hope that you suck the joy out of everything you touch you do oh yeah I hope that you make people walk on eggshells because they're afraid that you're judging them all the time I do judge them all the time father good because I'm judging you too I'll go put a cast on you look like a loser dad we've all been there okay you have something you enjoy but you're constantly worried that someone you know is gonna criticize you for it maybe not to your face No but they're thinking it I swear and so you end up adjusting your behavior based on someone else's judging it and I don't think that's any way to live I mean really essentially what they're telling you is this you know how that song makes you happy well that's because you're stupid and you can't give people but that kind of power over you don't worry about what other people are going to think like what are they somehow threatened by the existence of things that don't meet their standards oh just the fact that I'm in the same room issue a it feels like a physical assault on my person how can you like the Transformers movie I'm making how like your soul is I'm sorry I'm sorry that's sad to me I just think as a society we should spend more energy encouraging people and less time demeaning them and making them feel bad for their taste in their hobbies like if you want a blog can you happen to be a girl in your 20s just go and do it who cares that some people think that's cliched those people are cliche or if you want to I don't know juggle or thing or dance or anything can we all just agree to encourage each other to pursue the things we enjoy instead of tearing each other down yes yes Jordan you've inspired me to pursue my dream Jon Ruben what's your dream well I you know I've been thinking I want to get back at it I want to I want to be a professional rapper again again that's a little silly I do like your jacket though but I think that you wouldn't need this you just told me look guys all joking aside everyone has silly things you don't have to be embarrassed or ashamed of the stuff you enjoy just because some people make a habit of being condescending just enjoy what you enjoy it's what makes you unique well but now I'm being cliche so let me just go ahead and wrap this up okay you're very special don't forget it stay tuned for a scene from our next cow that's jazz and Jasper Oh as in Ohio I no no no no oh hi h H next week on messy Monday's Kelly calls out a sub tweeter so were you stop tweeting about me when you said the root thing about 20 year old girls blogging no no I just know some other girls who have vlogs and they're so cliche I like your blog but you tweeted it like two minutes after we talked about mine well yeah because I was thinking about blogs how cliche they are yours is fine it wasn't about you okay I've gotta go why does no one respect privacy not everything I quote is about you hashtag First Amendment hashtag so over it hashtag bye Felisha wow that's great wait I gotta learn of luck all right thank you all right very good [Music]
