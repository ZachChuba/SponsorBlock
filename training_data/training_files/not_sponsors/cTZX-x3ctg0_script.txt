hey groupies welcome back to former therapy this is the culture study i'm the channels video producer and your host you can call me pd and today we are checking out more and more by twice twice in their latest comeback i am super super excited twice Soloman concert last year which was one of my favorite concert experiences i especially got to see them on my on the floor with my friend it was a huge twice fan and that was a really really like kind of life-changing experience for me regarding twice and then their previous mini album was phenomenal it might be one of the best mini albums i've ever heard and it was such a great evolution in twice's music mind you the rest of the b-sides on the previous album are a little bit different than the title track but they were leaning towards and evolving towards since fancy to then feel special they were kind of escalating more into dance tracks so i'm curious as to what more and more is gonna be like are they going to continue the trend of having or a focus on dance tracks or is this gonna be something different so we're gonna don't want to or you can't we understand let's just get into this video this is more and more by twice and this is your former therapy ah she's back not not gonna freak out hold on this sounds way too quiet what's going on no my volumes normal Oh maybe it's an intro sorry for stopping I know I don't usually stop on the first run-through I just thought that audio is messed up hold on it must be an intro it was an intro sorry about that there we go Wow [Music] you know I have missed you [Music] [Music] oh my goodness [Music] geum-bun de [Music] [Applause] oh my goodness [Music] there's an interesting mashup of genres here where it's like a bohemian a hippy genre mixed with more of a jungle concept going on or more of a wild nature concept and it's a little bit like psychedelic and mesmerizing [Music] very very much more of a hippie bulimia inspired concept what in the world am I looking at [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah ah whoa certainly not what I was expecting huh don't get me wrong the pause doesn't mean that I dislike it I very much like it I'm just very surprised by the avenue they went on with this concept there's also like a I definitely have to watch the music video again but there seem to be like a an odd religious theme going on or at least not necessarily religious well there was a whole Adam and Eve concept going on or little portion of it maybe we're gonna watch the video again but it seems like musically they are progressing towards this one was also more of a dance dance pop track but that bridge was incredible it was probably one of their more intensive britches and one of their more intensive dance breaks I mean all of their dance breaks are actually pretty darn intensive because of the amount of people that they have and the way they push the group each time with each come back I feel like it's hard to say that this is the most intensive but it is definitely up there in the upper echelon of the rankings if you were to say but let's watch this again real quick and let's check out this music video so the initial vibe I get from this is like this is some kind of a paradise that they're in also orange hair very hard to pull off sauna looks great with orange hair see that's so then you've got the cut to red and usually in music videos when you cut to this kind of a negative color space it kind of insinuates something a little bit darker and because they're also cutting to a snake and then you've got the whole Apple bites going like the Apple eating going on like is there something more ominous at play here I just I love the instrumental for this though like the soundscape the way just like kind of it's so it fluctuates so fluidly [Music] [Music] see like you've got like these overlaying images like not necessarily double exposure more like it's almost like those kaleidoscopes this gives it more of a psychedelic hippie vibe I feel like very reminiscent of like the seventies look what's with the editing on this it's really insane and so their outfits are very colorful but when they're in this garden it's a pure white which kind of represents in a sense and being more on the angelic side and I also love this shot of is that tie on on the left and that's probably Mina the way they just kind of part out of nigh on here let's the weight is oh that's beautiful yes so obviously in scripture there's the whole Apple and then Adam and Eve and then Satan taking the form of a snake concepts the fact that these are so and and the fact that they're wearing these white clothing which indicate a sense of innocence and Adam and Eve lost their sort of like mental innocence when they took a bite of the Apple which was the Apple of truth right [Music] [Applause] love the moves to love how fluid it is like this is trippy this was diamond-encrusted spiderweb [Music] [Music] I love that [Music] [Music] and like we're talking about is there a sort of a sinister element to this song like listen to this bridge listen to like this listen to the winding like dark electronic elements like it's kind of ominous [Music] it [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] just notice they're wearing like bell-bottom jeans in the in in the outdoor section of well first of all is this a legit set my goodness like how much of how much of this is CG and how much of it is a set like that's insane but I just noticed they're wearing bell-bottom jeans which definitely fits more of the kind of 70s fashion so this is weird looking at the lyrics and looking at the video like they talk about saying like I'm naturally selfish I'm gonna make you mine even if you run away far from me you're gonna be mine again like and like even look at the shot of chi yeul like this chi whole this shot see in in I don't have it I don't have anything to cover but in sort of framing when you cover up half the face especially in like movie posters it implies sort of an ominous usually a darker meaning like a villainous sort of portrayal and I feel like this is a weirdly dark song masked and poppy sugary bubblegum goodness but also still with the element like elements of that kind of Darkness they talk about like I'm gonna make you mine bah blah blah and I realize like are they sort of they're putting themselves in the position of the snake in the garden like that like this whole video isn't a religious it's not religiously inspired I think it was just that section that just to show you a little symbolism of the snake and the apples but they're implying that they are the snake in the garden they're the ones that are gonna seduce you and make you wanting more and the lyrics of wanting more wanting more saying you want more it's like once you have a bite of the Apple once you have the Apple of truth you're gonna want more you know you like there's no going back you're gonna consume more and there are differences too it's like it's like it's called the Apple of truth and they're wearing like pure white outfits when they're in the garden but then when they take a bite of the Apple their outfits change into something that's colorful it's like as if seeing it's as if eating the Apple you know gave them sight you know it woke them up and they're in this colorful fit the world is much more beautiful and they they go into like where's where is it this part right here it's like it opens the path to a whole new world it's it's symbolic of like it it's opening a path to a whole new world when you eat this Apple or when you you know fall in love with twice it's like a brand new world and so there's a lot of interesting symbolism here like I'm kind of surprised I don't know maybe I'm reading way too much into it but I feel like that is exactly what's being presented here in terms of the song I really like it I'm glad that twice is pursuing down this dance track I'm glad that it's not like similar to fancy or feel special the only way that they're similar to fancy him feel special is that it's a dance track but the sounds and the genre the genre and like the inspiration feels way different it does kind of fit like this refreshing summer vibe that we have but I do love the intensive moments in song as well so this was really really well done I'm really surprised but you know this is something I have discussed with some other like kpop like producers who analyze the scene and something that we talked about regarding twice after fancy is like that's like the best way to kind of evolve this group this group that was inherently a girl group with very cute cheery songs how do you evolve a group without it being drastic and without it being so different that people reject it it's like you slowly evolve it over time and like what kind of genre of music do you go into and dance is dance tracks seems to be a very perfect fit for them and it's not that their choreo wasn't hard or difficult or intensive before it was but this is just a very different style of intense of intensive choreo that I think is really really cool to see and I think twice I didn't think it was possible but they are evolving and growing even more right before our eyes so this was a great concept from twice as more and more but guys what did you guys think from the from the comeback did
