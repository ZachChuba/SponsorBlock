hi my name is Sarah I'm a filmmaker and today I'm going to be reacting to red velvet peekaboo automatic and dumb-dumb as you can tell by the title this is another collab with my friend honest in the discovery series we show each other groups that we really like I show him boy groups he shows me girl groups and we just introduced them to each other and today he's introducing me to red velvet I sound so chipper II today I don't know why hi everyone my name is honest from his hacia channel so for the last video I tried my best to make Sarah very interested in twice but I knew it was a difficult task but actually she gave like a lot of positive reactions towards them I thought she would really not like them that much at all but I'm glad that I was able to let her know some of the most historical legendary girl groups twice it's one step at a time with twice for her okay she'll get there [Music] this week's girl group I recommend to Sarah red velvet red velvet comes from the legendary company SM Entertainment my favorite group of all times I got me into kpop was Girls Generation so this is a company that I respect a lot and red velvet is girl group like no other like you never know what the hell red velvet is going to have as a comeback one moment they're sexy the other moment they're cute they're truly the most unexpected come back come from red velvet and they have their red concepts which are more like cute songs and they have the more velvet concepts which are like sexy R&B influenced if it's a combined red velvet concept which I like to refer as what the so I'm so very excited to see her reaction because my god red velvet is legendary too I think what's gonna happen with your bias challenge is that you're gonna go between joy and Eileen here's the thing I would have gone with joy because at the last video you said you like chewy but I'm gonna go with my guts and say Eileen because Eileen is such a striking beauty and if you pick Sookie instead I would still accept it as I leave because I had confused them for along so but my my answer is Eileen my bias is Wendy I just love her vocals and her positive energy always makes me so happy so I'm so excited to see what your bias is gonna be like yeah I'm so so excited I can't wait anymore so let's tune back to Sarah so honest biased guess was Irene I was a little confused with joy / solji i think is her name i don't know which his second choice is but he said irene would ultimately be my favorite member I have seen I think I know Wendy in the psycho video is the one with the white hair in the fringe and I think and I have seen Irene's face before as well because they're just the most on my Twitter timeline but yeah I don't know any other names except for Sookie no which I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right sorry if I'm not I don't really know a lot of red velvet I just saw that they're SM I didn't even know that they were as I'm I know the song psycho and I love that song I also know Sims Alabama and I don't like that song at all this is song called ice is a call ice cream cake which I don't like as well but I do really like red flavor so I don't know it's kind of like hit or miss with me for red velvet generally I prefer darker concepts and what I see here for peekaboo is not necessarily dark but it's also not hire like overly cute so I'm excited to see this if you want to feel free to subscribe and like the video but you don't have to think red velvet generally are more on the cute side similar to twice but I could be wrong so Oh pizza I'm hungry why are you showing me this so far I like it okay that's [Music] this is like it's not cute but it's also not not too I don't know how to categorize this [Music] I think that's Irene the one with his ponytail [Music] okay what's so funny [Music] how lucky is that guy on the same it's going on in this video are they gonna kill him [Music] all right [Music] what is going on in this video are they killing them did they kill him [Music] no okay oh my god he has blood on his face what the what the oh my god I thought they were like cute they're like killing people okay so song wise it's it's not it's not my favorite song but it's also I don't dislike it but I don't think I would put it in a playlist maybe maybe if I listened to it more I would like it more okay remember wise actually the one super stood out to me but I really I really liked her I think she's the one who's also in the middle of the table later she's like super pretty and then I think it's her too it's the same person maybe this is so funny the way he likes miles up whereas I think this is Irene the one with the ponytail because I have seen her face on my timeline as I said she's very pretty too but voice wise I mean I only really noticed her singing that high note I like her I think that's probably Wendy I'm only saying that cuz she has the same haircut as in psycho huh yeah okay so the video oh my god I don't know are they just insane they're like hurting each other like she's like cutting her with this with a with a shaver and like they're on face by it both of them and she's like threatening to kill her and it's like I don't keep well whatever then they're putting marbles on their pizza like it's a are they playing a game I don't this video is like well also why is she dressed she's the only one who has like not completely red outfit I wonder why obviously they're like playing with him and toying with him and they're like want to kill him or like hurt him where I just have like literally just like toy around with him I guess like look at all these weapons oh my god but I don't know why look how they're just insane that's just what they do there's a lot of different vibes that I'm getting from it like sometimes it looks more like this for example it looks like dollhouse and then sometimes it looks more like a movie like these scenes looks very like movie like I don't know what vibe I'm supposed to get from this video like it's supposed to be badass and scary or is it supposed to be fun is it I don't think it's supposed to be cute I don't know there just seems to be so many likes different sets and lighting changes and yeah sets overall shots as so many so much so much going on and I thought she was saving him when she liked this I thought she was saving him but then she's back here again and she's the one shooting so I'm like she could no other like duplicates of all of them right I don't like I'm confused well I don't know if that was interesting or helpful at all to any of us oh the lyrics let me read the lyrics really quick so yeah it seems like based on the lyrics it seems like they're just kind of like crazy ex-girlfriend vibes as in like they're insane but they don't know it or something like then we locked eyes peekaboo is this new is this love as if like they saw someone in the day immediately fell in love okay let's see if they continue at this vibe I also know bad boy by red velvet which i Ã´ll again I really like I don't know what's their like what's their concept I'm a little confused on their concept because I know again ice cream cake I think I mean I don't know what the lyrics are about but it seems to be really cute so well let's watch automatic again I don't know what to expect this was this one is two years older than the previous one so maybe this one is more cute maybe they're just like started cute and then they're like going more into the like psycho crazy like concept I don't I'm not sure let's see [Music] that is so different song it's like our beat army I mean I can see how this is about like [Music] [Music] I'm like this was not something I expected this is like so smooth damage Maria's culture I like her boys the ones missing I don't know where this off [Music] my song [Music] this is so like sensual and like they all have very similar hair colors [Music] [Music] you [Music] really I didn't even know there was music like the closed hahaha whoa oh my god [Music] [Music]  okay I didn't know music like like what I have what what this reminds me like a fiance like early Beyonce like me myself and I kind of vibes I have never heard something like this from a k-pop group like whoa remember wise I I mean the only moment that I really was like damn I mean I was damn the whole time but this is like oh my god wow she looks like what's-her-name I'm gonna insert the name of the person that I'm thinking of and she looks like her there here wow I don't know who you are but you were um I also like her it's this may be the same person I don't know um and then again I don't know who was singing here in the car this part I don't know who that is but I really like her voice the video is also cool I don't understand this part like is it all in her head maybe but I do like the video it's like very connected everything is like so she's like standing here with the plate and then she keeps walking and she sits down with the plate and then she puts it down and then we have all the other people like this car it's all like transition they do that a bunch of times where they like have a very similar looking shot and then cut to a different like scene they're like styling and this so it reminds me so much of the 1950s and I like this aesthetic this is like my my thesis film kind of looked like this I mean not really because I'm not as good as these people who directly stuff but like it's like aesthetic of like black background I really like like one-shot kind of looking and this too so they cut from the whole choreography with all of them to like them just doing what like I'm doing one part and then her going to the bookcase then they try to match the light but it doesn't quite match like you can see the contrast isn't us like strong on her face like her lighting here and here's almost say the same which is the light they used for the dancing and then here the contrast is really strong I really like this is very cool like and this all I love the shot that's so pretty and then we go through the book and we go to the car like everything is like connected is really cool how do we get out of here oh so she looks at the odd front of the car and then we have them dancing there and then obviously this one where she walks up the stairs and then down the stairs I like the video I like the song as well I think the more I listen to the song the more I'm gonna like it cuz I have to get used to the Korean language in this kind of type of music but I do like it a lot but like I am super confused on their concept now like I don't understand the group concept what I've heard of red velvet every song is like so different which I mean maybe that's their concept like even there the lyrics are like so sensual and sexy like wow remember why I like I didn't really get into it a lot I like I like her with the curly hair then I like whoever singing here but I don't know I don't know who's singing there and then I also like her wow she's like wow oh my god I love this so gorgeous okay let's watch dum dum again doesn't have to subtitles this is also 2015 so this is like the same year let's see how much they changed it within one year already it's hard to believe that that's the same group from the previous video [Music] [Music] [Music] there's my favorite songs Oh like out of the three like I love the beat their costumes like they're going well I like the song a lot [Music] my god [Music] I'm speechless I love this video like insane but I really like the song [Music] I'm this island I don't know what to say [Music] so what's very fitting is that clap is recommended right here because this video reminds me so much of clap by 17 so first of all I really like the song this is my favorite song out of the three I like the beat I like the chorus I like the singing I like the melodies I like I like the song a lot remember wise I can't really say like oh my god I'm most afraid I was very distracted I think this is Irene I can't really say who I like the most out of this oh my god there's so much going on I don't I don't I don't I think that's Irene again right this one I think everyone is Irene so they're in a car again so that's something that that's a similar thing to what did you read you to watch it's automatic and there's a moon in the back so that's kind of like a peekaboo Oh connections I'm highly overwhelmed I really like this video it's absolutely crazy and I don't know where to start about talking like where would I start talking about I don't know ahahahahaha like their dolls but then there are also the people in the in the like in the company that make the dolls and then there are these people and then I didn't think like what I kind of liked her I guess I don't I don't know I I wish I knew who was singing what like that would help me more to choose my favorite person if I knew the parts that she was singing I could say more confidently that I liked Irene because I already liked her because I knew about her and I know that I think people say that she is cold or something because of her face cuz she has like a like a resting face which I relate to so much because I do - so I like her already what is that is that like a two second shot are you kidding me like there are so many sets so many costume changes so many colors editing visual effects I cut everything is like wow look at this shot it's nearly the shot is four frames is that a mistake like why would you do that that's so well I likes things like that like oh my god like it looks almost like a mistake but I don't think that is a mistake I like the shot a lot this is a really cool shot like it's really pretty she looks a little bit like solar in the strong I really like her she's pretty but Ike I wish I knew who was singing what I mean I could look it up on color Cory actually let me want look at the lyrics really quick to wait was it what was the first not the second song was automatic I want to see who sang my favorite part that's gonna influence it oh my Trent the trembling over my heart my jumping moods I can't control it oh this is so cute I like the lyrics of the song what's with all these Michael Jackson references why did they do that oh I like the song Ally relate to the song so much that's literally me if I'm in any situation not even a romantic situation just like a job interview I'm just like okay hi I'm here I'm here okay I want to see who's saying my favorite part so who's singing blue Wendy okay I like Wendy's voice the most sort of this and if Wendy was I'll look up now Wendy and peekaboo yeah that was her so I liked her voice the most in peekaboo and I also liked her voice the most in automatic oh and she was her - oh God Oh Wendy hello oh my god Wendy oh my god Wendy and then in dum-dum honestly dum-dum doesn't help me at all cuz I I don't know there's so many to have so many different outfits that I don't know which one she was so I like Wendy um then let's go Irene yeah okay I got Irene riding this one beautiful whoo Wow she's gorgeous and she's the one driving the car okay wow look at her oh my god and then Irene in peekaboo oh she's the one who was like cutting she not the one who it yeah she's the one with a ponytail - okay okay Irene Oh - Irene is a leader oh okay oh she's an Aries why is oh she's 9091 she's four years older than me oh wow I didn't know that she's an area so why are all the hot people Aries sorry but like why um Wow look at this leader main rapper lead enter sup vocalist visual center oh wow she's like everything so let's look up so ye okay so he was the one with the fringe and this one okay mm-hmm that makes sense oh okay oh she was the one in the window ah she they do look alike cuz I thought this was Irene when I saw her okay Wow honestly they're all so stunning in that really in that automatic video like I can't like oh how would I choose a favorite then so again dum-dum okay okay she's also really I mean they're all super pretty I don't know who my favorite would be honestly they have Wendy yeah I mean I already looked up Wendy I really like I like Wendy I like a lot then we have joy oh well she's pretty they're all pretty joy and peekaboo ah Joe was the one I said I liked and peekaboo and then she was the one dancing in front of the car I mean honestly again I said like an automatic I think I have to go by voice which then would be Wendy because they all look so stunning was she the one yeah she was her okay I see and then we have Gary yeah Yeti Yeti I didn't know your name I'm so sorry Omar name don't you they have a like a big age gap in this group that's really interesting I've never seen that yeah I mean I don't think I don't know if I pointed her out at any point oh I thought she was Irene - no didn't I I don't know I don't remember okay so remember wise I don't know remember wise you're gonna have to tell me who I pointed out the most I think maybe Wendy I mean I spoke about Irene always but it was mostly because I knew who she was I was trying to figure out if I couldn't spot her at voice-based I think I like Wendy the most but yeah so that's my red velvet reaction I to be honest I don't think I'm gonna stand them because I'm so confused on their concepts like I don't know what I would get into if I would start standing them so that makes sense I wouldn't know what to expect with red velvet so I think as I said it's a very hit or miss so I don't think I will stand them but I do really like that they change it up so much actually I do like that cuz it doesn't get boring I feel like like they always do different things like if I think like dumb them and then I think psycho and even like automatic I would think those are three different groups that's just crazy that they have so much like range musically that they work with like that they can work in that their voices can work with doesn't make sense so that's really impressive and I've and I respect that a lot and they're all so gorgeous in Irene I'm I I didn't know she was the leader and she did all of the things she's literally she does everything so I my respect for her rose a million points thank you so much for watching my video I hope you enjoyed it red velvet I think I'm gonna look like I'm gonna watch them like watch what they do watch what they bring out and then hype and like listen to the songs that I really like because again it's like really simple album I don't like at all but then psycho I love that's interesting thanks for watching bye [Music]
