this week rag and myself are locked in a pvp world on karanja for two hours if one of us kills the other player that player will lose a gear piece for the final fight we cannot bank we cannot loot each other's graves and when the timer is up we'll head to the wildee to see who will win the final battle a massive thank you to free click the link in the description expressvpn.com links ocarina animals are you kidding me bees and geez of super satisfied kiddos mate we are about to send the pvp world high risk world as well with these new these new like skulls dude i [ __ ] hate these i i quite like him i [ __ ] with him i [ __ ] with him oh i'm not talking about the school i'm talking about the pvp channel oh right okay yeah yeah yeah yeah dude just constant agony and stress the whole time wherever you could be at a spot and then you snake me first the next thing you know you gotta go to plan b or plan c you know but you know it i'm sure that's why they like watching these so we've got a five minute grace mate five minute grace we cannot attack each other in the first five minutes and then after that it is do whatever you want to each other oh man that sounded really bad link only to a sick [ __ ] like you i learned from the best right kids i'm gonna hop out the call then i'm gonna do a three two one go and then uh we'll start okay let's do it right here we go guys i'm gonna do three two one then i'm gonna have to click the timer so he's probably gonna get a little head start here but uh here we go three two one go here we go yeah he gets the little head start i knew it so first five minutes is going to be a complete grace first thing i want to do is go to the store the general store and just buy like gloves boots a bunch of bronze bars i think there's a hammer there as well and just make knives so uh we can't attack each other at all and uh i don't know what i'm gonna do as we said we've just flown straight into these we haven't got any plan whatsoever so uh we we we can't use the wiki while we're doing it catch the essen enemy oh 20 20 pure essence okay okay he missed it he missed it i think it's the perfect weapon to just kind of keep him off me yeah you can have those runes link i think it's the perfect weapon to keep him off me i wonder where he's going but yeah to the general store but uh yeah we can't do much so i'm just sort of killing stuff on the way seeing what i can do i don't know what he's off to do it might just be worth seeing what he wants to do to start with to try and get sort of his plan together and see what i can do to stop it see where he's going he might go and buy the food i was thinking about buying the food oh he's not okay i'm actually gonna go and go and buy the food quickly i think i'll just grab some like herring or something 13 coins cod yeah let's grab some cod and herring in case we run into him we'll probably be able to win a fight now if we run into him early where the [ __ ] has kin's gone okay it looks like he's buying food i think we have a five minute grace period so i kind of neglected that can we get uh oh where do you go the fishing vessel i think we can buy from a shop in taiwan i should probably do that first now that i think about it uh or at least in the five minutes all right let's trade uh where's the bronze stuff 12 coins that's so cheap how much is this stuff uh we'll just buy this and this because it's super cheap don't buy out those hammers ooh he's here okay so he's going for a trade here let's trade with her as well i'm gonna get a machete i'm gonna get a leather glove so i'm gonna get that hard leather body 31 yeah let's do that and let's get a hammer as well beautiful okay cool has he gone upstairs where the [ __ ] did he go okay nice we've got a weapon we've got a hammer we're kitted out oh he's bought the uh he's bought the [ __ ] bronze yet ah he's brought the bonds bars which means he's gonna have knives early on all right there is 50 bronze knives sweet so i think that's the quickest and best for how quick it was that is item that i can get to uh fight back if link tries to do any sort of funny business uh let's come here next to tia dish and trade and buy a vessel how much is this stuff 110 i'd definitely not get any of those uh nine oh [ __ ] that's expensive okay i did not realize that we could definitely fish nine right now though or however many this will catch i think it might be a bit less um just because i absolutely need food or what if he's gonna camp over there that'd be pretty interesting but there's two minutes left in the grace period and link doesn't have an armor or weapon slot so i'm gonna risk it and go for it he probably does have food though i definitely saw him hit that food shop while he does that i'm gonna grab the adior make myself a scimitar because i think simi would be better than knives i'm not sure yes one and the second one please very nice okay we're gonna be getting some coal now actually gonna send a telly i don't think we can use them in here can we uh i don't know if you can use these in the pvp worlds no you can't uh i want to send it over to the uh to the what's it called to czar because there's there's rocks down there and we can smelt them as well yeah it's probably the best place to grab ourselves everything we want so let's go over there can i spot him how long we got we got a minute until we can fight each other where is he i think i could win right now with a machete and some food i think we could win if we run into him okay so link isn't here so i hope we can get like at least five or six with this uh anything less i'd be a bit nervous to be honest because i have no coins i'm gonna have to mine and smith make some coins and then probably just buy more karen buanji come back um i'm not gonna focus on getting my full inventory of food in the relative future just because of course we we can't bank and the problem with that is i can't mine and smith if i have a full inventory of food um yeah okay that's that ah only five i guess it is what it is that's not horrible it's not horrible just gonna come over here and cook the crampons real quick i actually totally forgot to do so uh but yeah there we go i should cook these no problem and perfect is that five cooked let's see let's see beautiful beautiful okay the question is is link here oh god somebody died people probably pk here like not even talking about link right now people probably actually pk here uh and we can't hop worlds in this challenge so we gotta really really fight for these resources but we have a furnace here so we can make the bars instantly uh which is really good but to actually smelt them or i should say to smith them i can't do it here i need to go all the way to the center of karamja by taibwa wanai and uh yeah so that is a hike and a half but um there's also an adamant or rock on karamja as well probably pretty close but then you gotta walk all the way to shiloh to smith it or all the way over here so yeah it's it's um a lot of walking in this pvp challenge guys now should i wait here okay it doesn't look like kins has been here i think someone else's mind is addy so i think we're good i think we're gonna grab this i'm just gonna make myself a scimitar first just so we have the ali scimitar to run around with i think that'll be really super op and probably keep him off me for a good while um and to be honest i really need to think of a plan because other than that i'm not really sure what i want to do okay let's make a couple of bars and i think what do i want to do i think i've just got to go straight to the anvil to be honest i need to i need to get this addy scimitar locked down and we've got a bit of food so i think yeah let's do that it's a lot of walking to start with but i think it is going to benefit me in the end okay we're getting ourselves the annie simmi let's make that beautiful addy sibi lovely let's uh go ahead and sell this machete to get a little bit of money back 28 coins okay um what do i want to do here what do i want to do here i think i need to start mining and smithing uh yes how am i gonna do this i think going up here and smithing the money the gold is probably not the worst idea i could probably sell this off for some money okay i'm gonna buy chisel i got a sapphire here and i don't know if this is going to sell for a decent amount but it's worth having a look 125 gp thank you how much do you sell for 75 each that's pretty good to be fair uh how much you're buying for now 60 if we can get 800 gp we can go and buy a kp spear eight eight four i think that's enough i think that's enough mythos what a yes it is okay cool let's go get ourselves a myth from spear kp and that will poison kins if he does get into a fight with us which would be huge okay mithril kiss beer kp beautiful this is now gonna poison him and he is not gonna like that that's gonna be horrible to start off with very nice just got an irish seed from a [ __ ] nature impling painful there's an eclectic implement over here there's so many implings around this couldn't be a but this might not be the worst of shouts just jumping on and catching all these [ __ ] come here four right planks that might sell for a little bit examine oh 150 each high alk that's gonna be worth a little bit in the uh in the jenny store okay let's trade here and we can sell ourselves this silver off that i've got how much they're gonna 125 gp each oh yeah we'll sell all of those now uh the iris seed that we got as well go for it uh cool cool cool cool i'm going to buy a few crab ones with this i think yes i'm going to go ahead and buy a few caramel ones with this because i don't want to run into him i think by now he might have some caramel ones or something along those lines and i don't want to lose the battle because i'm sat here with [ __ ] herring all right how much does he sell these for 110 coins each on work vessel as well probably come back for that later i'm just gonna buy as many as i can there we go nice okay cool and we will cook these quickly i can probably i can cook them in the tazar actually um and then we will probably grab ourselves a little bit more uh adi and cole and i'll probably have to start getting rid of these herring i'll sell them back to the store up north a little bit of money back actually that was a that's a lot more than i thought i was going to get back for that so that's nice so if we use the raw quran one on here we can cook them straight off very nice little bit of food in case we do run into him now i think he might be mining the addie down here i think he might be so uh let's go and see him and see if we can uh see if we can kill him because a kill would be massive for this challenge okay so while i'm waiting for uh the rocks to spawn decided to try to steal from the gem stole the diamond maybe some recoils a diamond is actually beautiful for the necklace slot i don't even know how rare that is um i don't even know how possible it's going to be no no we need the mold [ __ ] it's probably not even worth doing this no he's not down here what oh wait he is yes he is come on poison poison poison poison come on he's got to be poisoned he has to be poisoned has to be poisoned oh god look at him here look at him look at them i'm not even poisoned i need to see a poison splat 19 lovely i gotta try to calculate this move he's probably got a lot of come on i have a hundred run okay here's how we're gonna do this here's how we're going to do a full run so he'll have full run as well though we need to see a poisonous flat we need to see one is he rocking an anti-poison this is gonna be tough for kid eyes come on surely he's not rocking an anti-poison yes yes he's poisoned okay nice nice and nice nice um i gotta sell something to buy an anti-poison from the shop but i wanna say that he's probably gonna run first am i going the right way i am up here got to keep moving got to keep moving i'm poisoned i don't know how much oh god oh god the poison's going to be doing its work i think we should get the kill here i think he's gonna have slightly more run than i do he's out front oh my god he's out front yeah we've got him we've got him we've got him surely we've got i've used a lot of prayer here though oh my god oh man no way hit yes there we go one gift he's taken off him at the end i can't loot him though yep there's the death right so picked up my stuff walking through karamjia to get to shiloh because i want to use this furnace i think i actually need some coins to use that but we could sell something off that's why i didn't get the ante yet either because don't have any money um but i'm gonna try to ignore link as much as possible sure i now lose a gear piece i do have uh gloves and boots so hopefully it's one of those pieces i do lose in the final fight but if he's trying to hunt me down he is just slowing his own plan down as well and i see he went the spear route to be honest i want to stay away from that as far as possible he's definitely going to bring nancy poison to the fight i will definitely have a nancy poison in the fight and now i know he has that he's probably not going to drop it he's probably going to use that in the fight and then have a main hand like that addie simi he had um and that could be you know potentially two wasted inventory slots the anti-poison that it'll have and the spear which will be amazing if we can get him to do that and i'm not even trying to poison him so continue on with the plan still try to just make addy still don't know exactly what i'm doing for a weapon yet uh maybe knives could be really good but i'll have to really think about that you only make five per bar uh 56 minutes left so it's one of those situations where i need to see how things unfold and we can kind of take it from there um to get some coins i could also mine some gems over here possibly and sell it to the general store for some quick quick quick cash so i could buy things like the ansi poison and whatnot i'm gonna sell this diamond actually i should probably try to cut it first only a hundred coins that's it how much is this [ __ ] cut a thousand oh snap that increases by a lot holy [ __ ] okay wait that's amazing let's just buy a leather body there's no anti-poison in here that's fine i don't really need one right this second um but no what we really need was the coins and we have it so what we're gonna do is just hit the furnace and then head back up to the anvil and smith some stuff we are coming up on the anvil i want to do this quick because this is like the hot spot i just have a weird feeling definitely a scimitar first um just so i could help get him off me um okay i guess i gotta go full helm i don't wanna think too much about this yep go in that for now as you can see i also mined two more addy ores when i was walking through let's walk for now we should definitely save run i'm gonna sell it to the shop because i forgot before buying an anti-poison um let's see let's see let's see then i'm probably going to go back to the desired mine and buy some food on the way there and hope he isn't there if he is then i'll then i'll plan accordingly but i'm going to have to try to make it there and uh hope he's not there so let's sell this how much does that sell for 125 big difference from the diamond wow um looking like that's everything yeah cool let's try to swing and buy some food and then like i said go mine uncut diamond grab one vessel coal i'm just seeing what he was planning on doing okay right so he's planning on fishing the uh the crumb ones uh i'm while i get this grace period or this time where kins can't come and kill me i am gonna grab myself a uh a little bit of coal so we can make ourselves just a little bit more addy um but that was nice that was really nice we take a gear piece off him at the reveals oh there's a couple more addy bars one more bar and that is going to be enough us for some plate legs i'm going to stay on that 100 run that 100 run actually meant that i won that last fight because king's run out of run and he just decided he had to take the fight so that is super important to stay um and do and i probably should eat another grand one but i don't want to horrible okay how much are these i'm gonna buy a caramel one vessel and i'm gonna buy a raw caramel one as well there we go let's get out of here okay we're gonna make a little bit more money here so we can actually get ourselves the 700 gp nice we need to get ourselves some crumble wanji and unfortunately can't fish it ourselves because we don't have a small fishing net does she sell a small fishing let's quickly have a look because if she does that saves a bit of money no i don't think so okay cool uh yeah we need to buy some karambungi so that we can fish our own um crab once because it's getting a little bit expensive and i think i'm gonna need a whole inventory to uh start competing here with kins uh let's drop the chisel we don't need that trade and let's buy 10 20 30 of those that should be enough now is he gonna be here if he is i think i'm just gonna send it i don't think he's here he's not here awesome i'm gonna drop the axe because i want the extra one am i going to drop anything else no there we go actually i can drop a grab one try and get one more and then drop the quran blankie nice go trade the hammer back because the only time i use the hammer is when i come past here to use the anvil right there so i can just buy the uh the hammer as soon as i come back and i need one more call so i can start to open up these spaces because obviously we can't bank if we run into kins right now i will be super satisfied all right alfonso the waiter let's just get some food uh that's a bit expensive to be honest those karambons so i probably won't buy those yeah let's just buy this and that should be fine for now that should be fine for now um because wow i'm so tight on inventory i'm not like mine six coal smelt it mine six coal smelt it doesn't look like he's there that's amazing news that's amazing news thankfully we're not going to be camping by here that much because of how often i actually have to go to the furnace but if he's coming here to mine that means he's probably also using the furnace so there's many ways to look at it and try to avoid him but at the same time um anytime he tries to attack me it's just it's slowing down his original plan as well um but of course if i die i'd be at the much greater disadvantage so i just can't die so i actually ate some of my food so i could do two trips per inventor or i should say two bars per inventory because the problem with only doing one it's a very very long walk and it would slow me down massively i am a little nervous that he's going to lock down the karambon fishing location and if that happens it's going to be really really bad news but of course it's very difficult to convince myself to get food first because then it's going to be making the gear really really hard so let's see next inventory i will have four five six seven i guess that really leaves me with six because and one left over for legs and a kite um i won't have a plate body oh i don't know i don't know it's tough it's really tough it's really tough to gauge what to do but i definitely have to try to get some sort of food but there's only 36 minutes left he could be doing anything right now i haven't seen him at the rocks yet unless he just happened to check here or mine real quick possibly when i went to the furnace i don't know there's a few options of course but i am completely clueless as to where link is right now but i'm keeping my run very high so if he does come hopefully i can outrun him and get away um i'm not i'm not like too concerned about dying this time around but you know obviously anything could happen oh there he is there he is there he is is he gonna chase me he is gonna chase me okay that's fine i'll definitely [ __ ] take this i'll [ __ ] definitely take this kids what did i just try and cut a tree how much runs he got that's the question how much run does kins have and is he gonna try and do the gate yep thought so as long as we got the run or similar run he can't do what he wants to go and do and that is a great part of the plan come on run out of run run out of run i'm sure i had like 90 something that's kind of annoying i'm just going to be sure at the end but i could still probably make it in combat okay okay oh my god we both run out of run get the advil anvil anvil anvil anvil and welcome i dropped my hammer oh my gosh i i'm so i'm i feel sick right now i feel sick we have this he's definitely more stacked than i am but i've got he can't be beating me on karam once he's just come from the mines come on i don't want to have to miss any like ticks when i attack he's doing horrible dps with that spear he's got a lot of faith in this spear guys you can't hit that he can't hit that noise or he's trying to get the poison in probably still okay ready let's act like maybe we're trying to run away like we're a bit scared but we're really just buying a oh damn out of run oh he's not hitting we need to see a point he's not hitting at all we need to see a poison of course they have the ante this could be good oh does he not have food okay he does while he's eating uh come here come on come on come on come on come on hammer buy one did i get it no chance no chance to get it i didn't get it i didn't get it i didn't get it i didn't get it probably sees i'm trying to something come on oh my god how if we don't poison them i know that'd be really dumb oh i did get a hair i'm sorry have we not poisoned him i know exactly what he's trying to do he's trying to make me eat and then he'll [ __ ] hit up the uh and then he'll hit up the shop yeah yeah yep yep yep come on yeah he's still trying to get that poison in [ __ ] i've been on piety the whole time didn't realize let's try to hide it with a with a heat right there come on i got to make this oh that's gap that's gap oh he's running he's running he's running he's running he's running come on come on come on come on shield i'm so low i don't know if i should fight um i probably shouldn't oh let's let's freak him out let's freak him out let's freak him out and a car and a shield wow this is really good come on hit hit hit that's gotta be it surely [ __ ] we do have the crowned ones and i don't think he's gonna have anywhere near that is that it looks like he's struggling a bit here guys how have we not poisoned him i've hit him so much come on hits hit poison him please please poison him surely surely he's poisoned surely i don't think he's oh [ __ ] he knows he doesn't have the food he knows he doesn't have the food he knows he doesn't have it come on end and end this is huge this is huge oh god oh this is dead this is so [ __ ] intense he's gonna just wait yep that's what he's gonna do he's gonna just wait for me okay this is this isn't he's probably buying the bread and whatnot i didn't have enough coins to buy bread backfired me a bit there i could always try to make something and then sell it i have an adam and i bar so but the problem is i have to run to the anvil successfully smith it when he's not attacking me come back buy bread and that's hoping that he didn't buy the bread out right okay so it looks like he's just gonna kind of wait for me he's so close to dead he is so close to dead which is a very interesting tactic on on his end over there um hmm [Music] you know losing a second item probably won't be the worst thing in the world if i lock down the fishing spot so let's say i die right come back smith this addy bar into something sell it buy the karen buanji buy the vessel go to crab blondes try to go somewhere else to cook it but come back lock the spot down and then if he wants food he'll either have to fight me for it oh he's up i'm the middle of planning link i'm in the middle of planning right that's gonna be what i have to do that's gonna have to be what i do and it looks like i have better gear now if i do die i lose one but i have leather gloves boots and leather body that i could potentially lose also so ah watch me lose two adi pieces that would be really funny actually right so i'm gonna i'm gonna take him on i'm gonna take him on nice [ __ ] yes beautiful right what's his plan okay that's fine that's fine that's fine goal to lock down the fishing spot asap the [ __ ] going on here okay he's got an adi bar oh okay so he's gonna get more he's gonna do more in a minute isn't he uh let's eat this let's eat this i need to go get more crab ones i think i can probably sit and control the crab ones uh let's sell some bread there we go and we can get a few more quran but why jesus they're 10 each aren't they the crumb one geez [ __ ] okay um i need to mine some gold that's what i need to do buy some crumble oranges go from there but the problem is he's gonna be here any minute uh this is painful this is painful okay what am i gonna smith what am i gonna smith probably just a i'm gonna just guessing addie swords the best thing to smith for money because i am going to sell it oh there he is he's right there [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] right okay not a bad price we need to buy one of these they're kind of expensive which sucks let's get a four dose going because we need to make sure we have one by the end of the fight you know yeah he was buying bread out and whatnot cheeky little guy cheeky little guy but that's okay we have enough money to buy the vessel we're probably not going to mine in smith anymore either so i might just drop the hammer i will just keep it until you absolutely have to drop it um going to save up all my run now not going to use it anymore and we just have to try to get the vessel back and then lock down the fishing location let's see if any spot out i mean it's bought out but is it him who's buying it out thankfully it spawns back really quick so it's not that much of an issue i need to make a little bit more coins [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] is he here please don't oh he's here he's here he's here he's here he's here he's here he's here he's here he's here should i attack him he's going for it he's going he's running we can get the ball he's running with the shere khan yeah i see what he's doing i might just let him go though i'm gonna let him go i'm gonna let him go because i if i chase him probably won't kill him because he has a lot more run than i do i'm almost sure of it and he's gonna cook he's gonna cook it anyway and then he's gonna have food and then i won't that's not good because i thought i would uh i thought i would be able to control them but he's just come at the wrong time which is really really annoying um let's grab ourselves i need to grab myself an anti-poison in case he's bought the myth has he though he hasn't shown it once so i'm not sure if he has got it or not but he is gonna have crab once which is a big worry because i thought i might get away with uh with not having though with him not having those probably drop a couple of breads and get myself some myth now because we need one more and then we can make a chain body i think chain body is probably going to be the way to go with what we've got here oh no i just poisoned two i was trying to one-tick him i was trying to one-tick them [ __ ] that's so dumb that's so dumb [ __ ] i'm fuming with myself i'm absolutely raging myself if i lose my two [ __ ] crab ones i am going to hit the roof well i need to make some money as well i need to make some money so i can oh it's all coming wrong it's all going wrong i need to get the myth chain body that's what i'm gonna do that has to happen right now and i know he's not over there so let's go do that okay this is gonna be three myth bars and i'm doing it at the other furnace because i think he's less likely to come this way but uh we need to now fire on down to the shop and get ourselves a hammer so that we can make this into a chain body the chain body is going to be massive so we really really need to get it nine minutes left so decide to come over here to cook the koran bonds honestly i want to run into link that would really prefer it because like i said i have the armor and he doesn't and if i could drain a lot of his armor before the final not armors food before the final fight i think that'll be really beneficial and yeah i can cook these things a lot faster what am i doing i'm trying to do too much brainstorming so what i'm going to do is probably sell some of the korean blondes to the shop to the general store come back down to tia dish buy more karen buanji to put in the fishing vessel and just walk along the popular fishing path between the fires and the fishing locations or the only fishing location and see if i can pick off link at some point it's now it's now my turn to go after some blood you know i gotta lock down the fish oh my gosh guys i actually did not buy enough karen buongi well technically i didn't sell enough korean blondes to get enough coins to buy karen buanji so i need to do the same exact thing over again and i'm actually quite annoyed because now i don't have the fishing location on lockdown there there's no real solid way to cook over there which kind of sucks but i mean it wouldn't have taken long for me to walk all the way down to cook them and truthfully even if i found link there i would gladly sacrifice uncooked food to attack him so he couldn't fish or even cook those fish just mined a few gold and a few silver and i felt i used the furnace as well just to try and get a little bit more money and buy some crumb ones just at the end we'll see if we can or not six minutes seven minutes left let's see is he camping this no okay i don't know what he's up to i have no idea what he's up to 836 coins i think that's eight corrupt ones make the chain body nice and let's go buy the quran ones i don't i don't think i've got time to go quran wangs and go and fish them unfortunately now i need to make enough money for an anti-poison that's what i need to do that's definitely what i need to do that's what we're gonna do beautiful i think that's enough for us to get an anti-poison and then i think i'm feeling pretty good we've taken two pieces off him at the reveals as long as we can get this gemini come on come on is that what she's called oh [ __ ] by one beautiful i'm gonna avoid him i'm gonna avoid him i don't think it's worth it okay we are coming up on that full inventory we also have the annie poison what you guys see here is pretty much the final gear that i'm bringing to the fight um of course minus the two spins that i'll have to do um so i will lose two pieces of gear but again i do have the gloves the boots the leather body which if i lose any of those i'm not gonna be that stressed so i don't think he's fishing i think i would have seen him you know crossing paths at some point uh and you know doing three fishing trips over there with the karen bonds but i wanna say he's probably buying his food and i was gonna go up to the food shop and camp there but no way i'll get there in time enough to even really cause a difference so i decided just to hang up by the anvil in case he wants to do some last minute smithing or something so i'm going to spend the rest of my time here bronze card shield oh my gosh he's here oh oh my gosh he's using the anvil pity he can't use it oh my gosh what if he's trying to smith something good like a shields a helm he's got some myth on too holy it's okay okay he definitely was mining and smithing no it's not gonna do it let's not chase let's not chase uh he's coming back oh i see what he's trying to do he's trying to get me to follow that he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing no he can't do it he can't do it oh man [ __ ] sake humid at least it was only a bronze shield let's get into a call with him thank you boy who knows mate you stopped me making this you ready yeah i don't see it so bad dude wow yeah if it been anything else i would have been super stressed but raging right let's fire on over to edgefield mate yeah let's do it my guys little snake all episode so kins we we've seen each other's gear here uh yeah obviously we don't know each other's inventories and you also have to lose two items of your gear yeah set up for dying twice um so to be honest mate first of all great strat i saw you run in to the shop and you bought the gloves and the boots the leather body and i was like that is so smart yeah and the bronze bars for the knives as well yeah yeah yeah yeah um so that was smart and i like that because obviously for those you wondering those items are in this spin for kids so he could just lose gloves and boots and then it's like he still has all this addy on which would be amazing so what we'll do first kids is we'll do the the two that you lose and then i guess we'll go into uh inventory setup and see what we've got food wise and etc yeah cool cool this could literally determine everything so we're looking for gloves boots i'll take a body which we actually checked before it's like nine slash defense or something like that it sucks but i'd rather boot your gloves right spin here we go come on come on do you want me to tell you yeah why you didn't put me suspense anyway first one to help first one's help mate okay all right oh it sucks it sucks but um out of the addy items that's the one to lose yeah yeah for sure [ __ ] okay okay okay okay all right and your second one mate uh we're just gonna get rid of helm here here we go mate good luck come on be behind be kite be kite be shield be shield yeah you lucky little [ __ ] it's it's it's gloves it is gloves yeah it's nice right i'm gonna go bank my stuff that i can't wear i'll i'll i will take that the worst daddy item and one of the better ones that we definitely want to see being taken off these gloves raging i saw your strat early on to start ragging me and then i was like okay i have the better armor and you have the worse armor but you have the upper hand of me losing armor but i'm also thinking like he has to fish or buy food last because it we're ultimate iron man it's so hard to prioritize inventory spaces so after the second time you killed me my whole plan became just rag you so hard and try to drain as much food as possible so you'd show up with little food and of course i just i'm looking everywhere for you and i don't find you i certainly i mean we we ended up at the uh caravans and i was like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] and then oh yeah i got you to have a box off with the uh the big lion [ __ ] and i got away there but i don't know i had like 20 run or something so i was like i have very little run as well though kids [ __ ] um and i don't know how many karat one g's you had there and how much you so yeah my problem was was money mm-hmm yeah money was cash convoy yeah i um made all my bars into items and stuff and the only two sources of big money items i had was um addie sword which i just smith said one extra bar sold it and i got a diamond yeah i saw when i killed you every time i killed you i checked your loot to see what you're up to and i did see the diamond yeah i sold that for 1 000 coins yeah and it came at such a nice surprise i got so i got a sapphire and i also did a few implings and i got um four oak planks which was like 500 600 gp right right here we go this is going to be huge this is going to be huge now i don't know whether you went for the for the sphere or not i can't trade it okay so you do have the spear i do have the spear i brought it and it's poisoned so i have no idea what spear it is it's a mithril kp okay okay um well ha ha i okay you know how to bring one of those i brought one as well okay did you get one did you bring it up did you bring a spin i did not go for a sphere i i just figured i figured you were definitely gonna bring an anti-poison and that would hopefully just waste a slot for you but i saw you have the spear early on so it's like it's not worth me taking that risk for one piece of food if it comes down to it i can also see that you've got off over tree and i'm really worried it's corrupt once well i mean we were fishing cram bonds so i mean we know we have at least some karan bonds i could have topped off with meat and i don't think you have can't i'll say that right now yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] wow oh man who has the better defensive bonuses here mate i don't know how good kite shields are wow that's actually a lot lower than i thought [ __ ] um i'm only 73 slash defense oh you've got more than me yes [ __ ] right yes dr jekyll just uh just turned up and gave me a strength potion guys but unfortunately it's outside the timer so i can't use that so that's why that's in my inventory i'm kidding so we played another yeah kids we did another episode over on your channel where we had three different locations which were randomly spun on a wheel and uh we didn't know the next location we were going to so we had to like prepare for 30 minutes in location then spin and see where the next location was going to go but we could take anything we had in the previous locations to the next one so by the time we were at our last location we had like a really cool setup made from different cities which was very cool so if you want to go check that out click the link in the description but now it's time for the fight are you ready link yeah here we go mate here we go that was not a good sigh at all that was not a good sigh at all did he just [ __ ] oh nice poison straight away no chances respect i don't i mean i don't think the mid spear is even better than the adi oh nice so it's not even worth like switching to oh yeah and i won't anti-poison unless you hit me so it'll be one of those things where it's like kind of beat you know yeah yeah yeah ah bit human if you'd lost the shield or the cut or the legs this is mine this is mine for the taking yeah that that's why i was a bit nervous to try to rag you early on because i knew there was so many other little things you can get yeah um if it was easier to get money there was also this thing you could buy for a k called like beads of the dead oh yeah yeah the beads are dead yeah yeah yeah yeah i didn't even know you could buy them i thought they were just quest related uh yeah it's like 1k in shiloh um something like that so uh like that was my strat going in sort of just kind of get as many junk items but you know it didn't really work out as well as i hoped but thankfully the spins were they were calling kind of on my side yeah they were kind training blows here mate [ __ ] hell i should probably just eat it's not it's not oh gosh let's keep putting some some more in come on keep doing it if kins could win some rng in the previous weeks give me some now jagex yeah i mean honestly this isn't much different to like what happened on other episodes where somehow we thought it was no chance i'd win and then suddenly i won so i mean let's say you hit three twenties in a row that's you know like sort of evens out the food ish i think i had seven more than you so maybe not really who am i kidding i'm trying to make it sound like it's like link has a chance here okay i'll try to be nice yeah tempting is just to bash the strength part so hard mate i mean like we we figured to drink it half the time little baby get one legitly oh man [ __ ] can't believe it cannot believe it why couldn't he lose he this is the helm he's [ __ ] sake rng doesn't like me mate he's raging he's a risky boy it's gotta happen mate oh my god oh uh-oh my man says hi oh my gosh you're about to die mate you're about to die kids i'll tell you that me hey as long as you dude are they actually repotting right now yeah yeah they they want you right they they're going yeah dude why is everybody arguing on me right now [ __ ] come on nice maybe they can distract kins into a loss i hit them funny would that be come on literally trying to go for us like what's wrong with you kids freaks yeah [ __ ] telly they have no idea and that's no idea come on it's 2005 and we're enjoying ourselves i love how they were like okay this fight's going on too long don't care yeah yeah exactly i mean we should have boxed all the way to the [ __ ] uh whatever that place is called that's east of us now the [ __ ] forex yeah that place there we go how much different would you think life would have been if you had that uh bronze kite shield oh i i'd be i'll be sipping pina coladas mate over your dick over your dead body [ __ ] how much food mate wow um 18. wow how are you how is it that high the rng gods do not like me right now kids kids kids hey wow it really just kind of came down to rng right there i think that could have easily flipped if i lost like legs and helm or legs i don't know who you've been sucking off at jagex right but you did a [ __ ] good job wow there you go dude i'm not gonna i'm not gonna lie i don't know where this goes it's just quickly confirming to thousands of people that you actually did suck off oh no i just watched your videos anyway link you thought with pokemon i think we know who really lost this video can i i know wow okay i'm just i'm just gonna show myself out see you later see you in the like end the video link and the video i can't even talk right now click the link in the description guys to go and watch the next episode that we rocked it i'm not going to say it seconds but
