alright ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another episode of RL crafts brought to you by our sponsors at MC pro hosting providing the server on which we are playing probably looks a little bit different right now because I have m√¢che ders turned off because I uh I need I'm sorry to do this to you but I need more wither bones so what the would eat what is this strategy I killed it oh good job I didn't realize you shut the door on the last second so I was like what's she doing there may be a way um yeah what I what I figured we do is so um how's your bow situation I do not have one I see I see Oh actual mm what I could do for you what I could do for you is so if you would be so kind what kind of do get into a gift exchange here potentially okay I would like to take my dragon bone bow and undo it so I get an infinity power for book then I did get one wither bone when I was in the dungeon yesterday and so what I wanted to days ago or whenever it was so do want to do is I want to make a dragon bow a new one okay I'm gonna do that okay warn you right now that if you undo your bow from what I've found it only strips like the top enchant it doesn't seem to give you all of the enchants oh okay so if infinity is the top end chant it'll it'll be infinity yes okay well actually no let me let me just double-check what this sucker shows up as that's good enough or not they chose flame on this so I would prefer not what I would do for you though is I have a power power for showing up in the table if I put a book in so if you are in need of a good bow I can hook you up with the power for and it's you could put that on some kind of bow or dragon bow if we get another wither thing but for now I can also would you like that would you like to power for I wouldn't I mean I certainly wouldn't turn one down okay I'll do that real quick for you so yes I guess is power for the quick the quick answer there and then we'll see if that changed anything here lesser flamed and kind of kind of bland kind of man so that seems like a good point to actually could I get myself up to magic oh I could hey would you look at that so now I go here and I oh it needs a book I see will it tell you what the book is gonna end up as before you remove it yeah you can see at least though the one yes oh okay cool and I don't know again I don't know whether it could possibly give you a book with multiple but I've never liked that has not been my experience in the few times that I okay yeah it gives the top so it's infinity actually I'm totally fine with that and now I'll have infinity and I want to see if I can combine these boys here so I'll have infinity unbreaking 3 would be kind of nice but what can you do you know go to advanced power wow that's that's expensive that's expensive my gonna need more oh my goodness died suspensive it's 18 Wow I need more levels here's your power for though by the way thank you what a power for book so it's a powerful book power for book oh wait you know I should I should read some of the Kowski doodles vampirism on ammo yeah I feel like I mean you could try if it works it'll probably let you do it if it doesn't work it probably won't allow it so seems reasonable I didn't mean that subject mathematics one of the subjects enchantments gives extra damage to all sharpness to all light sharpest and also gives you additional advanced damage based on the targets age wow that that sounds like a fancy boy antics increases the damage of tools oh that's nice yeah dude I love hitting things with based on your world's difficulty prot 3 ok interesting stuff ok well I was just looking briefly through the books and whatnot and then you were saying that you wished for me to make a bow I mean it's it's your call alternatively if you want to save that power for for another bow like a dragon boat we can head back to the dungeon real quick and do it that way I'd also love unbreaking but unbreaking never really likes to show up in the thing so that's the downside dude actually do I I don't have unbreaking on anything Wow Wow breaking is I have a lot of unbreaking on your gear though right yeah yeah actually applied yeah I just really haven't lucked out when it comes to getting it out of the enchantment table for some reason it does not seem to wish to happen what's like nag you're good oh god it's so foggy when I don't have the shaders on it's ridiculous there is a lot of fog I don't like is is there something going on like oh you you see it too well I had the internal shaders on like I'd gone from regular shaders to just internal and yeah there was a lot of fog what is what do you mean internal shaders there's two different actors the in-game shaders and then your on SIL ders vibrant shaders wait there's in-game shaders it's called internal shaders oh I don't know if it's in game or if it's a [Music] Optifine but it just comes with it like it's not an installed one oh no so they're actually uh I don't know if you recall me saying it like way way back when we were setting up this series and I installed solders enhanced I was like dude are you dealing with like some real nasty fog here I can't see any more than a few feet in front of me you're like no no I bet I've installed vibrant it's fine so there's something about like having to use vibrant in this in order to not have this weird nasty fog yeah I wonder if they you know I mean it could just be this there's some add-on it makes it wacky okay so I wanted a potion ring is the precursor for the yeah yeah jump boost haste strength would be good you didn't like the reading of regeneration didn't you I have it right now it's very slow but it does work it eventually gets you back up to full so I'm kinda I'm mixed on it a mixed yeah I've got resistance resistance i I think resistance is pretty good as well so I'm thinking I'm thinking thrones turning this into strength yeah the strength has been nice getting a little getting a little oomph behind my chutzpah how many golden apples do you currently have on yeah seven is something you really have on me give you a few more okay here you go I made that made some more with the apples that I found in the dungeon I seen it yah do I am here for you I am here to help dude thank you thank you for that we seem to be low on magma blocks not that we can't go and get those hopefully pretty easily although so far was it Magnavox was it so oh I don't need a minute no I do need one okay and then I need more campaigns because another just an absolute trash can dude I'm so over the nether realm you know there was that yogscast song a long time ago not sure if you caught it it's called screw the nether kind of feeling it I'm kind of feeling it yeah yeah I'm good it's good to have fields it was a minecraft parody of what was it maroon 5 moves like Jagger so he's like and it met I'm over the nether now he's it's a screw the nether screwed screw the nether you know yeah dude you know you know me out here without serious tunes do you have any of the charcoal or did we make charcoal we made some it's probably sitting in the furnace the closer ones to the anvil bottom rail yes very nice thank you mm-hmm and then that goes with paper I believe got it right in the first try and this ye like that it's some paper there also have you seen our dragons because hey what dragons a big boys did they grow a lot offline I like I just went looked at him just as though like all big boy really okay I will go check I will go check big boy in one moment very very cool whoa tail sticking out whoa what happened here did wait well yours is 308 mine is did you feed any more dragon meals yes I see that that would make sense but you are stage two 41 days have you entered stage three I can't get Kim click on the I can click on Steve I'm stage two but here I have gift for you oh my dude all right of course I can't click on Steve that would make sense actually take a take a couple more cuz your guys you get more bones yeah we had like a stack and a half of bones when I go back oh right the dust oh yeah I mean I haven't even used all of them Oh 46 days I don't know what they what they are you I am at 46 okay we are equivalent now Wow so at stage three is that when we can ride him I have no idea what's gonna happen I just feel like it's it's getting big in here you know you mean it's get any small in here so how are you big in here how are you gonna do this thing like you eat a lot of blocks to do full-coverage here oh it's good well I'm not gonna like cover it like I don't know I don't know I honestly I'm gonna log on and I'm just gonna start digging and I'll dig down a double to down deep and then we'll see what comes of everything or maybe I'll line that I don't know okay I don't have a plan I was just like this will be the area and that's as far as I got well do you want to go back to the dungeon real quick I really want to test out my advanced power for because I have a feeling it's going to be an absolute monster and also more wither bones would be great because then we can make more dragon stuff sure the dungeon is fun it's always nice to have no frames if you turn on if you turn off your shaders if you turn off your faders it's actually like really doable okay yeah I know the deal dude another deal Gambel's do you think there's much I mean I guess we didn't get we didn't make it down to the actual nether portion of the dungeon did we no we didn't and I think there's still plenty of spawning going on we didn't knock out all the spawners at that skeleton place I mean the thing is is the more were there the like the the spotters are automatically empty themselves or they were still it seemed like it was still going ham when we were last there when I left cuz I logged out there when I left there when I walked back in and left there wasn't much going on well let's give it a look and see what happens this way I'm assuming you're with me no I hid a skeleton I'm following though I'm assuming after you bud oh wait who else should you be oh you which one of y'all kicked me so far I have one hit everything and that's a good time I'm like to hit on everything with this bow though oh yeah what the heck are you oh I got this bud that's a shade Duns ode what do you drop obsidian sitting in ender pearls hasn't seen that one before though Danny you're one hits for days I like it your gear is geared out I like it what are you smelting in here nothing furnace is just on oh you passed it I'm in oh you found it I'm in the place dude I am NOT get into the place this is the place to be all right back to the dungeon we go steam life just needs a snapples dude you coming down uh where to go where do you know where the staircase down was no of course not okay way down oh there it is Oh God that hurt that hurt then cutting it Wow did you did you take a quick route down yeah I took very quick route down and somehow it did not die yeah I've been very impressed right now I don't even have feather falling and I took very minimal damage so well do you have you have your your balloon right I know I don't so how did how did you end up Steve acting down like I just took the first stairs down well I went down and then you see after I went down what happened is I tried to jump across a hole and I thought there was water at the bottom and it was ice oh ouch mm-hmm it hurt a bit yeah no that hits you in the unpleasant but anyway what I'm doing right now is I'm acquiring cobblestone to help build my way back up as where I am is kind of a no man's land of nothingness it's not where you intend to be mm-hmm its pitch black what are you talking about dude it looks fine to me all right I feel like this is the level to be on maybe at least Oh backpack with some stupid we found a what with some stuff in it maybe hey wait oh I thought you were unlived now a lot of these behind worth in these same spots behind these quartz things where the spawners were a lot of them have chests that we didn't get a chance to look through as well right yeah a lot of stuff in there it's like you can you can oh hey there you can grab oceanevelyn um why would you hear me jingling when I turned it off your jingle yeah dude you turned off with a little jingle no I haven't turned off my jingle no jingles I met max jingle that was very frustrating to listen to I'm gonna be honest with you where were the man's all over the place where we're getting overwhelmed something supercharged the chupacabras like they just seem to be running at a million miles an hour some true dat true dat okay so I'm gonna go down the stairs in since we seems like that levels clear oh is it oh right it was the vine level that did that yes I believe it was in this area backpack and random things apparently dropped here I miss I miss my my my shield strength to education increases the amount of experience you get for unaligned enemies that's pretty cool and crit strike okay out oh wait question is where did all those man's go oh there you are okay there are still a lot of guys down here are there anytime you anytime you want to come along a dude I don't know where you're at I'm just literally like the right down the stairs of the vine level oh that is oh you're down the stairs more from the vine level no I'm on the vine level I'm so dumb I don't have a bezoar on oh my god that's what I missed putting on don't know where oh no no we're you're oh you're over here oh I see I see I got one with a bone no this is still not the exact spot we were at last time we were getting overrun do you know where that was yeah no I we went by it it was just empty oh really okay yeah it was upstairs and it wasn't in the vine level and it's there's a couple it basically ends in like a drop-off down into open area because that's where I got blowed up by the everything right right hey buzz anybody here oh this is interesting new checker board room I've been here batter up batter sharpshooter increase projectile speed and oh my what the hell are you doing not good trap chest boys oh yeah yeah yeah let me tell you about that that's what happened to me oh oh good thing I got blast prot yeah it was it was explosive there was a there's a lot of exploding okay there you are hey yeah it went kibou me boom it really do like that sometimes I don't know what you're still looking at though I don't I don't know do we do we go down further you think I mean there's it seems like most of this is pretty dunzo Oh a there are some more chests back here it looks like whoa that's got some stuff on it barbed hook five silk touch defusing edge this gives a fishing rod a higher catch window barbed hook five way oh dude I got the ultimate fishing enchantment apparently you are ready to fish like no one we out here at Bass Pro Shop Boys I found it little nut like a dungeon hey I'll take the bones out of your sharpener - and fatality one power three wowie-zowie boys a broken heart I'm sorry I'm sorry what is that a bobble I hope that's a bobble it is a bobble yes what is it what is no I need to be able to put my things somewhere else I need to wear that oh why can't I put oh man sad yeah I need to get I need to get a bezel back do we have any and I just haven't put them on or if we lost all our beds I think we've lost them all good damn it I can't I can't put the Dragonstone in any spot other than the head spot of bobbles but I found a pair of sunglasses that I can put look that looks stylish dude I want to see you looking fly let me see you take off your helmet but I want to see you know you can see through the helmet I don't know if you look very stylish Wow you know wow it's a good it's a good Friday Wow alright down we go I guess huh I rocked him better than you would have I guess who do dad oh it's troll boy let's see that advanced power dude oh he doesn't take cat wrecked Braille he does not take projectile damage though it seems like how do we get down you don't know where the stairs are I haven't seen those but this things get a little dicey down here I mean obviously I know that it's there we've been there but the wear of that is a little more suspect hmm I mean we might be able to just kind of go down an opening in the eighth yeah I saw an opening through a cave down into yam I might explode II explode out exploded arrow saying will DX put out xsplit outed ya how you Frick dude you trick dude oh I found it I did nice yeah let's see if I can

I'm not gonna destroy this spawner I'm doing pretty well food baby zombie has a freaking helmet way to high over its head it's like the game thought it was regular size oh my god dude I'm just I am making a mincemeat I am I am getting my revenge yeah yeah like I I'm in the room where you died excusing you and just like you know checking in seeing what's going on there's a lot of fog the fog is real this is where like people crammed a whole bunch of oh there's a wither bone you got a Whizzer bone yeah boy whether or not you like it there's another one get the freaking carrots and geese livers out of my inventory and get the wither bones in all right Oh God whoa no no no oh god we got a thief shoot oh that's not cool that's not cool you didn't plan for this did you no I did not okay it's down I see it oh my god you ass I'm getting straight so hard by this dude it's ridiculous oh god I'm so thirsty it I'm so thirsty me too actually it's a good point okay guys hold on for a second I need to drink I can't see a thing I have to throw these books okay give me my sword thank you what the hell one other Steve spawn the instant I picked my sword up I currently can't use my shield because of the stupid thing there thank you thank you like you're not taking damage can you take damage I'm trying not to actually bro I just need the wither bone please give me the wither thank you thank you that skiwear Bones guys okay to wither bones Oh wither skeletons skulls are nice I wish I could use my shield it'd be handy catha wither skeleton skull very good Wow them big big diamond leggings though but not as good as what we currently have all right oh god dude I need to get these enchanted books it's all a mess it is all an absolute mess it does seem like there's a lot of mess mm-hm take that one out oh hi you were big a big spider trying to sort through all this crapola oh boy and a lot spawn there was there's a lot of spawn edge yeah hey man at least at least there's still some stuff here better than not being stuff here and I've been able to kind of seem roll through most of it until some dick face steals my sword that's that's when that's when the the moment changes yeah whoa okay there yeah there's there's just no way to deal with all this freaking loot dude hey all right we got bones there's a lot going on right now okay I think the spawners just broke I still they did okay this one here but I wish you wouldn't you would okay so drop you drop you my mouse needs to be better my mouse needs to be better yeah you have bad mouse analysis Ben it's being a dumb-dumb I'm sorry about the dumb-dumb it's okay okay maybe when we put things that I care about in here can't believe I haven't gotten a better though dude think I got embezzler by now one would have hoped but here we are all right have you acquired any wither bones I'm trying to sort through the lutes that have greased me and there's a lot of them so I don't know at the moment hmm any less urbane okay think are you good there huh all righty not bad not bad any a man's over here whoa doesn't seem like like I killed a fair number of things but it wasn't it doesn't seem like there was much in the way of wither bones involved in it that said at least I got two of them which will enable you to get a dragon bow at long last oh there's Manson here long last there's man's in here I'll tell you that much oh it's a rat it's the dirty rat dear-dear ahead I got an arrow of slowness though so we're good to go uh I found many more man's though yeah yeah yeah sure where their spawner is though anyways me mouse break I don't honestly know why you do this you know really do not know give me all this grief about how I have technical problems I mean it's working it's just annoying every time I lift it to reset its position it stops functioning for a bit Oh eyeball boy I do there's man's over here myself a bladder actually do not know where the frickin smart is here though there we go oh it's fancy okay so this is all done so I'll put that there I'm going to take this hey hey not seeing these forest oh so you wanted more magma blocks for magnet rats I got it okay no I I was walking by and tore up like half of a wall and yeah we've we've we've got the magma blocks okay ain't no thing okay so here here here I guess the blaze spawner expired but no wither bones was the was the bad place where I got wrecked was that pretty done oh yeah know that what that ones well done well done yeah not rare we yeah no it was we've been through there where's my bucket go oh geez did I toss my bucket dude my buckets important here's all your loot there be my you Frick there be my you Frick heck is this I think that's a different dungeon like that is exposed oh the weird chunk here I mean you were there so I oh is that the one who died felling do with the ice I need this oh man if only I could undo the unbreaking from these diamond leggings I mean you can yeah but protection is ahead of them is there any way to like work around that I have no idea of anything to do with it I probably could stop collecting all the glowstone I ever see ever but yeah I mean you know the the torches aren't nearly as important these days that was that's that's a habit from a time passed mmm I could man actually you know what how are you doing on your armor like could you use protection for on anything I probably like my armors all enchanted but are there any pieces missing protection blast protection for physical protection - magic protection - and prot for okay so never mind you wouldn't be able to put it to use yeah all right I think we might have cleared this out at least um you know to wither bones is better than none and then if we ever find another one of these because they have to be around yeah I have some good fights but just didn't translate into actual wither bones and I was what the hell balls oh hi jeez that was wacky I hope I'm not seeing people are saying there wither skulls on the wall and I'm not seeing them I think maybe you're mistaking the texturepack skeleton skulls for wither skulls because have you seen any wither skeleton skills on the wall I've not seen wither skeleton skulls no yeah now that doesn't mean there aren't any but I have not seen them hmm upstairs I was definitely only seeing in standard skeleton skulls I haven't seen any wither skeleton skulls at all this is where you died I mean I think we've been through all the spots here are some skeletons skulls but they're regular there you got another look around just to be sure but sure I don't see it I'm leaving behind the mini porches - Queen I'm gonna go back upstairs and scan again don't I think this is a myth but um you know we're investigating we're making sure we're there could be another way oh this could be good it's neither yeah there's more with her bones are you upstairs yeah it's just one more spawner here zipping around where's that with her bone they go I got it okay cool worth three now I think that might have expired the spawner it was on its last leg good try dude sharpshooter three increased projectile speed and range reduces in accuracy yeah I've got another one of those too [Music] all righty here's some skulls not seeing any wither oh there is one there's one there's one it was not lie it was not lied oh it's concealed by the vines we could actually spawn another wither I'm sorry I ever doubted you all I apologize should have known better I don't just stubborn that way no this is where dungeon freaking Mouse is this is this how you want to escape listen I was its I just I don't know what I was doing I feel like you know the stairs are right here we could take those if you're right you're right well I'm naive why would I take the stairs dumb ideas we wait at what point did I say it was a dumb idea I don't know you enjoyed it nice nice what the why did you punch me oh sorry I didn't see you there what I was going for the chupacabra rude that's a mean one rude yeah out of your bud you're a mean one mr. Grinch okay where is our last up it's right here oh I see it what level you at 35 Thanks mmm no over here actually we could recall potion but yeah why bother I guess at this point at this point we're already up and we're here school where was it well I feel like we've pretty effectively cleaned out that entire thing I'd have to agree wow that was a bladed trumpet boy you didn't even pick up his bones brah wasn't wydad oh I saw some it looked like blade lines it didn't it didn't say anything no okay sorry my bad my bad wow he's a fast boy whoa that was a blady boy oh when it's boys get out me life get out to meet get out to me life my all right way either you know hang a right oh I'm I'm a thirsty boy hey I can finally terminators back on it's very exactly now you just have to wait for a while yeah videos every let's go Barry normal you normally what is normal Dewey yeah you could look up a definition and I'm sure it would give it to you so I stopped and you know loading shaders Lance up a chat yeah well I load shaders what do you guys think we should do with our levels we have many levels we do have any levels I've been through a lot of levels oh right get rid of lesser enchants they are bad okie-dokie lesser flame is do do bro I want some sharpness on my sword then I mean egg plays kind of makes sense that you know lesser lesser a chance or lesser yeah they do do enchant che I could just do books level my skills level my skills is a good one well should I do that's never a bad idea because your skills are all bad block that's not great iron skin you know what the iron skin proficiency is no why would I know that or I could level up these things a level up defense which is dumb but the Ches nice I don't know whether I use the poison I mean I guess I'm not sure Oh iron skin is great okay do iron skin its base right do we know if I do the level cost 11 on something is it going to take 44 down to 33 or is it going to take the equivalent of experience from 0 to 11 no idea well no here we go God dangit that success sucks I should have been chanted first it takes 44 to 33 damn it iron skin reduces damage taken 5% damage reduction per level that's not bad actually I almost want to put a 2 back on that and take away this oh wait projectile amber but I can't decrease you I can you know can't decrease that okay 25% at 5 that must be so expensive little wise though alright and so with I do that why is sharpness so impossible to get a hold of it seems difficult to find for sure let me throw a sword in like I don't know I really even see sharpness show up when you throw a weapon directly into the enchantment table it's just like an having a thing that likes to happen but if I could do it and an atomic dis the constructor - wow that's a hack has a very low chance they can guarantee Oh an instant-on alive I see sharpness 2 minute you get it I can't get it now I could get it slow 15-inch amp I'm thinking everyone right there nice good wonderful I feel like we could probably throw out some of these stacks of rotten flesh just throwing that out there is a possibility yeah maybe you could know that it's necessary for what we do hmm I guess I'll just keep looking every time I do an enchant sharpness to I just don't know if it's worth it to get it and then keep combining books and stuff like that until I get something good mmm I'll get it I'll make it unlike destroyed the ender dragon in one shot that is actually a funny idea that is a haha funny lol here uh where are you oh you're upstairs I can't actually get it though because I'm not thirty so check this I'm dropping at your feet oh wow sunglasses boy cool guys don't worry explosion cool guys don't look at explosions you just go in your head slider it's a bottle nice thanks nice - nice my eyes kind of pop up over the top and my mouth just comes out of the nose slot so it's not the not the best look for me okay so there's no way to make a bezoar grant immunity poison and withering are you kidding me that would be amazing oh it does wither - Frick where do we get it last time well no no you have to you have to create that you can you can bind a black dragon scale and a bezoar together to make it one that does both and that would be that is nice AF well you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna cycle through a level one enchants and I'm gonna cycle through level 1 enchants and then I'm going to see if potentially I show sharpness on something big sharpness I mean and just the big sharpness big sharp boys so what do you think I should do with this space for the Dragons because they don't seem to be like with the Dragons they don't was gonna be flying off I don't know maybe you take just take a lot of dirt and then line it so that that's to in I don't know why I want to in but I kind of do no oh there goes Tommy the instructor at whatever dog everything I'm thinking about it just ends with I don't know mmm lesser sharp five come on Garbo dude Garbo Garbo dude Garbo you turn this into a double chest though would you like a way that are bone so you can make a bone yes here's all of them oh my gosh there's so many whether bones Oh dragon do dragon arrows work with infinity I don't think so but when I say that what I mean is I have no idea lame dragon bow strengthened the longbow dragon bone strengthen longbow versus the dragon bone strength from Bobo's Dragon boom bow I don't know what's better a dragon boom bow or dragon's bones strengthen longbow okay I'm Bouchard oh okay so will it will work with infinity let's see be pretty cool alright well can I have one of the wither runs I use them all cool oh thank you mm-hmm okay I'm breaking one into shards regular bow it's a to you I have the I have the regular bow on a regular I don't know maybe I'll sit on it and I'll get chats advice and feedback and we'll we'll make a decision at a see how much damage this does and if it has infinity these charges yellow any monsters useless hmm do you say you'll go back in the mind and did yes I want to I want to check the damage on these dragon arrows and see if infinity works with them hey mate hey what's up yeah infinity works with them nice one hit boys I don't know if it stays one hit but infinity to do work that's nice I asked that though because infinity doesn't work on the special arrows so is not a guarantee no I I understood the basis the question you know I was always mentioning that to chattarowski because yeah that's all do you want your sunglasses back by the way no no no no they're yours there might get to you thanks man yep much appreciated I figure cool guys don't I can't explosion I can't put them in my bobble slots I figured cool guys don't look at explosions and so they are there for you cools your it certified cool guys wow I am honored hah nerd the walled kingdom begins why is it Hall lesser lesser is dumb I mean like I not disagreeing at all but I I'm wondering if perhaps lesser is more common given that its lesser lesser is a silly thing and just I'm just trying to think through things here inhumane flinging a knock back come on chef moisturize moisturize tilling will make the farmland automatically wet Wow I have some experts like stop stop stop well I'm building a wall so what's the wall for its to hold back the the isolation that's what it's the I see there a point to putting a wall against cliff listen yes it looks it's maintaining the look ok don't inhumane adds extra damage to illage is an interesting enchantment lesser sharp you fought for I mean if you're cycling through level ones then doesn't that explain why you're getting less no no no I'm looking I'm cycling through level ones and looking at the level 30 that results ah yeah ash destroyer there's so many like weird and jamuns dude I will dispute extra damage if the enemy is on fire ok very specific but if you had a flame sword than perhaps that's exactly what the doctor ordered and could be you're right you're near true I'm true you are the truest disarm one sharp this three huh oh really that's I mean it's sharpness bad now and do we not like sharpness no no no I'm just saying that sharp this three is level thirty like sharpness is so rare that it's like that's what you get at level 30 right um oh my goodness that's rough well what can you do what can you do honestly I might have to get that at some point and just kind of stick with it I mean it's good then I'll have to just continue to work up my thing let me make sure that I can actually even apply sharpness alongside what I currently have I don't think advanced sharpness is a very likely thing to happen in this lifetime doesn't seem like I wonder it is there one way some way in the modpack that we're not realizing to get enchants it's better than just random through the you know through the the enchantment table is pretty usual I don't know also apparently I can't put sharpness onto this thing anyway because it probably penetration I'm assuming so so your goal has been something that it has been squashed an unattainable goal radius yeah yeah so that's good that's what we were looking for you know yeah umm unbreaking would be nice and that doesn't seem to happen either unbreaking looting all these things I've gotten some unbreaking 'he's not a ton but i've actually what level which anytime I have it I'm breaking 3/2 and breaking threes Wow lucky you my dude I know aren't I the luckiest let me see uh so where's your dragon pen work where's where's my dress oh I see this cobblestone wall that you're making yeah a wall huh I it's it's more to keep mobs out than to you know I feel like the dragons are going to exceed what I can build so the thought was more like you know put some torches down on the inside and then try and keep the bad guys out okay so is it so the Dragons won't fly away though as long as you tell them to stay with the dragon staff then no okay so it doesn't have to be enclosed actually yeah no I wasn't planning like I there might be I might do something to try and do like a slab roof that's way up or something but I don't need to build like an entire literal structure around it uh-huh so at least that's the hope and goal and stuff but my main concern honestly like cuz at this point with the Dragons staying from the dragon command staff like a part of me was like I could just take them and put them outside my main concern is I don't know if some random spawn event or something is gonna cause a bunch of guys that will then kill them like huh and like they would I do I back you mean well I mean I are or it's just it spawns enough that it overwhelms I might you know like they're still growing and stuff so like that's kind of where most of my concern has been is just in trying to keep them you know protect to protect them basically you must protect here I dialed it all cost I don't know whether that's valid whether it's necessary I'm like crazy have you gotten any more bones any more bones yes I have a few dragon meals that we could share amongst us okay but I have enough dragon meals that were we to give them all I would be concerned about this the living situation okay well 25 right now this bizarre is crazy dude no I was looking at the color dragon scales one yeah that's pretty groovy dang that's very expensive though we need to go to the end at some point though yes we do need to do the end and I'm sure that there are some surprises in store for us their turns not perfectly vanilla over is that a wink-wink hint hint I don't know that's a I suspect suspect we didn't suspect I just made a lot of I just used all the bones that I got at the dungeon and the made that more dragon meal here you have if you like to make a dragon big so we have 30 dragon meals there what 30 we have 30 dragon meals oh wait wait wait on me oh my god well that's literally I mean you know I was using words I don't think you were listening but I was using words where I said that I didn't want to give them all to them because I'd be worried about how they're going to gotcha which is why I've been focusing on the pin again okay well I want to make them sound level bigger well I can't make your song a little bigger mine sure seems to like being on top of yours though like I mean it's it's it's fine you know they like each other we that was our hope when we you know got them together but it's it's a common thing man alright so at what point does it turn to stage 3 good question 50 would be a decent just checked yep stage 3 at 50 okay here how many what it what stage are you 49 how many days are you and 50 okay should we put them in the horn to be safe oh god oh god you can get on them you can get on them Wow Wow look at that big boy health right there dude like how you get off of them at nighttime and they used to be instantly sleep just like thunk good night dude that's gnarly okay this is noisy mine is quiet and polite I must have my hostile mob sounds turned off or something and they're roaring you're not asleep now mine went like insta sleep this is like I'm too tired maybe I don't know we will come up no baby Oda I need you to we're literally gonna have to break them out of this cage no we can dragon horn them oh yeah yeah yeah yeah Frick I can't retrieve my water just just drinking Shh don't worry about it in the corner trying to drink heartily uh dragon races absolutely oh dude oh dude we could take them into the end and we could dragon V dragon that is not so and also awesome at the same time yup yup you better believe it dude all right I
