i accidentally became a meme and this is that story my name is brittany broski but most people know me as kombucha girl this all started in august of 2019. i was 22 years old i was living in dallas texas i worked at a bank in trusted investment services life was very normal for me i had no idea what was coming i downloaded tech talk as a joke because i kept seeing ads for it on snapchat and i was like what is this people in furry suits and all this like cosplay was kind of like the main thing on the app and then just by accident i started uploading because i ended up having a lot of fun on the app i didn't even know what kombucha was and uh i just kind of wanted to try it i was at the grocery store one time and i walked by the aisle and i was like why not so i bought it i just kind of got home put all my groceries away set up my camera and just filmed me trying it no well and the reaction is genuine i mean it's kind of nasty but the flavor i got was like a soda so it was kind of sugary and it didn't do well on tick-tock it was downloaded and uploaded to gay twitter and they took that and captioned it when i ate for the first time and other ones like when i tasted for the first time and all these nasty like i work at a bank and i dm the guy who first uploaded the video and i was like hey like this is me in hopes that he would take it down because i was like i don't want to get fired but he was like oh this is you and tagged me under it and i was like oh so then i started getting an influx of followers i had a private account with maybe like 400 followers it was me and my friends in a day i got like 12 000 requests and i was like well man i guess it's time to go public so i made my account public i gained 96 000 twitter followers in one day like it is insane how fast it spread the meme actually like not the video but the two reaction pictures it there's no language affiliated with it so it that's how it went so viral is it doesn't take an english speaker to think faces are funny i started seeing my face on like hong kong protest posters climate change posters in new zealand like it was global insane you know then it's like well how do i tell my boss what's going on when you're 50 60 like having to explain the idea of a meme like as jinzy to a boomer is like i would rather die so i had to explain to her this wasn't me like i didn't caption it when i ate for the first time it's someone that's taken my video and captioned it with a funny caption so whatever you see like it's out of my control so there was a fateful day early september where i was pulled into my boss's office and she was basically like you need to choose if you want to be a meme or if you want to be a corporate professional i don't know girl i have rent to pay obviously i want to be a professional like what do you want me to do go work at outback steakhouse so i was like no please like it's just a hobby and she was like okay but then sure enough i mean a week later like she brought me in slid a piece of paper across the table and was like you know i think we're gonna let you go i was mortified i was so embarrassed to tell my dad of like i got fired from a bank job like that's so embarrassing for what because i'm posting videos of me doing online like i graduated college i graduated in three years i was magna laude like i work i'm a licensed insurance agent i worked at a bank like i have every intention of being a functioning member of society i understand and i don't hold it against them at all like having a young 20-something-year-old fresh college grad around online saying i'm a banker like all it takes is one google search so i made sure when i had that call with my parents that i you know like there is a backup plan it's not just me sitting on my unemployed i had a team behind me at that point and you know a week later i was flown out to la i was meeting with the platform headquarters i started working with comedy central mtv like all these major brands and networks i was a presenter at the streamies i was in a super bowl commercial i was nominated for a shortie award tick tocker of the year like what i i literally can't even keep up and that's not even the brands that i've worked with it's just a dream you know it wasn't just hey can you recreate the meme like i was pumping out other content i was doing accents impressions skits like what i've always done and now that all the eyes are on me i was like if there was ever a time to create content it's now caleb caleb mom says get out of the tub quit trying to drown yourself then it's ready literally we're almost coming up on to the day it's august something right now and i just hit 5.1 million being a meme is very dehumanizing people forget you're a real person like if someone would tag me in something i'd respond they'd be like oh my god it's like yeah i'm real i had some old like tinder matches text me again and i was like why no no absolutely not block i have every intention of you know stand up snl audition all that my number one is voice acting i want to be in a pixar film so bad i want a voice act for a disney film it's like i'm a multifaceted person i have so much more to offer than just you know what i mean but it was such a learning experience and it's got me where i am and i'm very grateful to be where i am so hey disney pixar hey blue sky studios how y'all doing call me you
