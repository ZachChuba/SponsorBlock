Hi, I'm Griffin Johnson the armchair historian today's episode how America's mission in Vietnam failed Good morning Vietnam and everywhere else The Vietnam conflict is one of the most controversial chapters in US history and helped define an entire generation Its enduring notoriety can be traced to a number of factors these included unprecedented media coverage and widespread distrust of the American government to Help understand this watershed moment were asking the question of how a global superpower suffered such a humiliating defeat Before we talk about America's defeat in Vietnam We'll have to talk about Vietnam under French rule which started in the latter half of the 19th century Since Europeans are just so great at listening to native people and respecting their pre-existing geographic borders They decided to call this region which includes modern-day Laos Cambodia and Vietnam Indochina presumably because it's sandwiched between India and China it was all very subtle and creative France quickly and decisively established themselves in this region quelling any uprisings and forcing local rulers to cooperate with French colonial administrators but this changed during the Second World War in 1940 France was occupied by Germany leaving their colonial territory largely undefended and Japan was quick to seize this opportunity Some initially saw the Japanese as Asian liberators But were quickly disillusioned by the sheer brutality of the new regime and nationalist sentiments began to sweep the nation calling for self-governance once the Allies had secured victory in 1945 the French returned to Indochina and everyone was just so happy to see them especially the Vietnam Independence League were Viet men this group of armed insurgents was led by the once exiled Intellectual Ho Chi Minh, who is staunchly? anti-colonialist at This point the United States was in a bind as they once supported the Viet Minh against the Japanese during the Second World War but French stability was seen as an important element in stopping communism from spreading into Southeast Asia and men's Anti-colonialist stance was something decidedly Bolshevik in influence. Despite French calls for support during the 1940s and 50s the United States ultimately decided not to send troops to Vietnam by 1954 friends had completely pulled out of Indochina after seven long years of bloodshed splitting the area between Communists aligned North Vietnam and an Unpopular and generally corrupt Western aligned South Vietnam, but peace wouldn't last long in 1955 fighting continued but this time between north and south President Kennedy, like Eisenhower was hesitant to put boots on the ground in Vietnam after the humiliating defeat of France But after Kennedy's assassination in 1963 vice president, lyndon, b johnson seeing communism threatened the status quo in asia once more ramped up US involvement after the late summer of 1964 when it was claimed that two US ships that were aiding the South Vietnamese military Came under attack by communist forces in the Gulf of Tonkin Congress soon gave President Johnson the authority to send US troops and by early 1965 thousands were deployed now that we know why exactly America found itself in Vietnam, let's find out how it all went wrong The American soldiers in Vietnam were fighting two enemies whose battle tactics were well honed through years of combat against the French and Japanese the first were southern Insurgents called the Vietcong and the second were the more organized North Vietnamese Army were NVA The NVA was well supplied by the Soviet Union and China and fought with aggressive guerrilla tactics that the US was in most ways for Us general william Westmoreland led the American army in Vietnam and waged a strictly attrition based defensive war Westmoreland was known to have let politics dictate his decision-making process as policymakers in Washington Instead wanted statistics and numbers to show that they were winning Success was measured by body counts but counter-intuitively the more bombs that were dropped and the more people that were killed the more support the North Vietnamese gained The US was attempting to wage a conventional war as they did in Korea But the non-uniformed Vietcong were highly mobile and unidentifiable avoiding direct Confrontations whenever they could relying on ambushes booby traps and similar tactics to grind at US morale The result of this strategy was that there were no actual front lines while the Vietcong frustrated US troops in the south the NVA commander roll wings off also knew that a conventional war was Impossible to win and focused on winning over the people through an extensive propaganda network He is quoted saying do not fear the enemy for they can only take your life Fear the media far more for they will destroy your honor the Americans meanwhile believed that their attrition strategy Was successful and Westmoreland was predicting an imminent end of world But unbeknownst to him Vietnamese forces were effectively using the Ho Chi Minh Trail to move large amounts of supplies through neutral Laos Despite being bombed almost every hour By 1968 the US illusion of imminent victory was shattered by the Tet Offensive the Google campaign saw over 80,000 NBA and Vietcong troops attacked more than 800 cities throughout the country Including the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon much of the fighting such as in Wei became the war's bloodiest battles Despite launching such an ambitious attack the NVA made few if any tangible gains But it struck a devastating blow to American morale not only back in the United States But also in the field at home the leaking of the Pentagon Papers Also dispelled any justifications for the war and revealed atrocities such as the My Lai massacre Further increasing an anti-war sentiment across the country and a so-called credibility gap began to grow between what the public was told and what they believed as William, Westmoreland himself would later say it's the first war we've ever fought on the television screen and the first war that our country ever fought where the media had full rein the casualties suffered in the war were now seen in a new light with so many men having been lost thus far on the other side of the world and they Weren't even winning while the NVA could strike at any time faced with a crushing li- public opinion The American government was forced to withdraw the nation's forces in 1973 and two years later the NVA finally captured Saigon ending the conflict Now a word from our sponsor war thunder war thunder is a realistic vehicle combat game that is free to download on PlayStation 4 Xbox one and PC you can battle
