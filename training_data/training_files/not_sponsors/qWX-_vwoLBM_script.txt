it's we're on autopilot on Blue Ridge Parkway where they have just repaved but they haven't painted the lines yet autopilot has been doing a great job with no lines at all on the road I turned it on back where there were some lines and stayed on just has a couple areas where like that or it loses its kind of lane and then it gets it back but amazingly enough even without the lines just a little seam in the asphalt it's doing really well [Music]
