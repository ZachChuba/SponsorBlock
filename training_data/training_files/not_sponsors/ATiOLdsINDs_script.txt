this is my main runescape account after two years of playing runescape properly i decided it was time to take my account and coins to the dual arena i discovered a highly illegal scamming ring and exposed it to my youtube subscribers the scammers asked me to take my video down and i agreed as long as they put their profits towards a good cause they refused to donate to charity and they threatened my life instead and throughout all this i was busy anti-scamming their friends and i made a lot of money anti-scamming and now i'm rich bob we can't use all our budget on editing one sequence that was way overkill ah gosh i'm sorry i just got carried away anyway i've been using all that money to fund the progress of my account i've been training farming mining doing master clue scrolls even runecrafting imagine that gauntlet prayer training crafting you name it basically for the last two months i've been minding my own business pretty well so here i am innocently crafting dragonstones at the grand exchange when all of a sudden carlos 3454 trades me 418 million gp this got my attention but i'll get into expressvpn for sponsoring this video so do you remember that group of lures that tried to lure me for my scythe and bandos after trying to manipulate me for 30 minutes i was able to anti-pk their friend and i got a beautiful 56 mil out of it afterwards i created a completely new account and i'll explain to you why now these guys spend their lives trying to socially engineer people to take their money this has been against the rules for a long time and it's a bannable offense so i created this new account with the intention to add every single one of these lures to my friends list so that i could track them even if they changed their runescape names no matter what i'll always have access to their rsm i sent a message to someone on the anti-cheating team and i'm happy to report that two of the accounts that tried to lure me got permanently banned unfortunately one of them didn't and i'm still following up about that one but that is still two lore counts out the game but now that i've updated you on those lures let's get back to carlos the guy that showed me 418 mil so he trades me a varak teleport tablet i accept it and i'm gonna go see what he's up to for a second i thought i would be going to varrock square which is where he wants me to go but then i remembered i've done the varrock medium diary and i get teleported to the grand exchange instead so by the time that i'm at barrack square he's already gone and he's moved on to his next victim and here i was thinking i have a short attention span carlos was successfully getting kt slaves to follow him but it only took me being there for a few seconds to realize that carlos doesn't want to deal with me as well he only wants kt slays take note of how quickly he says follow and then hop my world too busy here i'm pretty sure that's an auto typer and he just clicked a button to type that he probably spends his entire day trying to manipulate people and he gets tired of typing the same things over and over again so he has some kind of program that does it for him now once carlos logged out katie admitted to me that she thought i was a part of the lore i assured her that wasn't the case and i went to go get my other account what do you guys think is the fastest way to tell everybody that you're breaking the rules when a player moderator logs in you log out and that's exactly what happened [Music] now that person probably doesn't care if that account gets banned it's a pretty low level so it's not worth that much oh and there's no sentimental value to the account either because all these lawyers they just buy the accounts online like i've said in previous videos these guys don't play the game at all they don't care about any of the new updates or the players they just want the player's money but because the lure was cut short i wasn't able to see the other parties involved in this lure it would have been nice to get the other character names that were higher level and worth more to these guys and that's where this next lure comes into play when one of their victims has so much wealth they bring in the entire team no time for playing around anymore this is time for the big guns five people three maxed accounts one piquer and one primary talker the social engineer these lures are in no short supply but never have i seen such a coordinated attempt i wouldn't let their lure attempt go undocumented not this time i was going to figure out what they were doing how they were doing it and who was involved once again it started at the grand exchange and phase 1 of the lure begins already they're bringing in the second talker to tell me how to anti-lure these people but in reality his advice is malicious he's part of the lure so now we have the second person a part of this scheme accounted for lure number one is asking me if i'm familiar with the telegraph spell we use in-game friends good good spell now we've walked from the grand exchange to east farrock what have they achieved so far in this first phase they introduced their character alejandro who confirmed to my suspicions that this is allure but he also told me it's possible to anti-lure these people he'll continue to message me and try to convince me that i can get money from these lures we move on to phase 2 where we go to a different location camelot i'm doing my absolute best to act like a noob and so far i'm very surprised they don't recognize my runescape name this is my main runescape account and the fact that they don't suspect i'm anti-luring is very surprising to me so now they're building on the information they've given me the primary talker i'm following tells me that i'm going to telegraph 100 million gp with the runes she gives me an interesting thing about this lure is that we've gone all the way to jazz it so which is secluded from all these spam bots that warn about luring the primary talker tells me to hop to world 43 the high risk pvp world you what i wouldn't believe it there's no way they already foiled their lure by showing a pk or outside the bank i was so disappointed i thought they would completely give up on the lure because they already exposed their pker and they would just go somewhere else and find another victim but no apparently this is part of their plan then the lure tells me sparkmack is his boss and that that was a little more surprising but then just a few seconds later the talker says you win all in game ooh im quit trade so which one is it is spark mac your boss who tells you to do giveaways or are you quitting runescape within the same 10 seconds he just contradicts himself but i think that's all part of the plan this talker is trying to convince me that his brain is the size of a peanut so i can easily manipulate him and take his money alejandro would approve so they actually showed me quite a bit of money 193 mill so as they're walking me through the lure i'm trying to think of ways that i can actually get that money instead of how they want me to think i can get that money then i'm asked to drink samorak brews which reduced my hit points to basically nothing making it very easy for someone to one shot me i wonder who it's gonna be fast forward a little bit and now i'm asked to get my 20 best pbm items now this was the time i knew i had to make a move but unfortunately i couldn't anti-lure like last time because every time i ate a food they made me drink more zamrack brews lowering my hit points again now this is really stupid don't actually listen to a word these people say in fact whenever someone messages you saying they're gonna do a giveaway or something just log out don't follow them don't do anything with them i'm only doing this to document it and let everybody know about this lure and seriously i am big dumb dumb for even thinking that i should pull out 1.8 bill out of my bank but like i said just doing this for educational purposes and i've had a good track record of not dying to these guys in the past but just look at the audacity of this talker saying including tebow and others he even asks me to take off my armor of course now they knew i was skeptical so guess what happens another account logs in and says ty for 30 mil so the talker and the pk are logged out and i'm given time with this other guy that apparently successfully anti-lord them now he tells me not to telegraph anything and that they gave him 30 mil through a trade screen he shows me i'm not able to telegraph the xeration hat from where i'm standing which yeah i already knew that it would drag me out into the pvp zone but you'd think that all this time the person that's been trying to lure me for the last hour would be sending me messages telling me to come to his world and get away from the guy that's foiling his plan but i'm not receiving any messages which means that the lure wants me to hear this information and all of a sudden the talker logs back in he asks me why i didn't hop for a second but we all know he doesn't really care and then he continues with the lure as if the guy that followed his plan previously isn't there right now and then he's still standing there the entire time so we're in the trade screen again and i show all my gear but apparently 1.32 bill isn't enough for this guy he says bring all 1.55 bill please and also to bring my cash deck which i hadn't showed him before but he knew i had it in a bank so he just demanded that i bring it out as well these guys take the cake for the worst kind of person and while all this was happening the pkr outside was in a danger zone so i geared up my friend's account and went after him with teleblock unfortunately i didn't get him i thought he might not be paying attention or he wouldn't get prey melee up that quickly these guys are really bad at pking the only thing they can really do is just click somebody with a xamarik godsword special attack so when i attacked him i was actually able to get two freezes on him because he was panic eating the entire time the pko logs back in asks me if i knew who that was i obviously say no and i come back for another attempt but this time they're prepared bringing in the fifth person into this lure they bring in the account lady to rag me off of the peker this is a completely maxed account with 2277 total and the runescape name lady which is worth like 6 billion gp on the black market and this is the scary thing scammers and lurers like these guys they get banned so rarely that they're willing to risk such high level accounts with completely maxed stats because they know they won't get banned they really went all out for this lure attempt because i was risking so much money they called in the whole cavalry i can only imagine one of them was screen sharing on a discord call with the four others but it took five people on the call to realize who i am and once they finally realized that i'm the anti-luring guy they straight up asked me if i'm chem q and i said yes the cringiest part they tried to continue with the lure and i let them because i wanted to see if i could get them somehow now that they know i'm chem q and they've incriminated a super valuable account with the super valuable runescape name lady comes up to me and assures me that she wasn't a part of the coordinated lure attempt that just happened instead she's just pkaying randomly in jiatitsu but then randomly changes his story and says a friend told him to come that there was someone in max gear for him to pk wait so there's a guy in maxed gear that your friend tells you to pk and you gear up in black dehydrospo and crystal shield okay and no ko weapon oh and also i found your youtube channel where you have loads of luring videos 20 biller video from 2016. damn you've been doing this for a long time if there's any justice left in runescape all of these accounts will be permanently banned these guys are sick sadists who just want our money they have no value in the community and yes once again i'm adding all these guys to my friends list so i can track them if they change their runescape names anyway stay safe out there don't get lured and hopefully these guys get banned
