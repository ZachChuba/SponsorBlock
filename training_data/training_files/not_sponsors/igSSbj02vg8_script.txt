like it sounded like you just picked up your voice and threw it into the blades of a helicopter yeah it's not it's not work if i hit v it doesn't work you don't say yeah if the voice says i carve through time sir sculpting the fabric of reality the contents in the model filmmakers are there to chisel it out all right do i need to have my in-game voice to do this no i thought it was just a preference you wanted yeah did you do the classic just restart everything i did and that didn't work well by god i have no idea then that's it 101 to 104. man it sure is nice being able to speak and game chat and all that ah i stretch my vocal cords out over multiple programs and now here i am back in game wow [Music] yeah that's funny is he's gonna do all this he's gonna get his his mic set up and then he's just gonna use discord to talk yeah the pubic wig liver died the choice is yours like the saw guy can i have you wheeling around the corner and a tricycle like this and then going yeah if you fail this you'll lose your audio completely wait what'd you say are you guys ready why do you sound like john luke picard when you said that little die the choice is yours [Laughter] dude i wish i sounded like [ __ ] patrick stewart oh [ __ ] hey look sam what's down here you must work as a team find clues and letters and the codes to survive live or die the choice is yours sign me the joker baby [Music] did we figure it out i'm going to press one of these buttons okay that opened the door all right it's the buttons i wouldn't i wouldn't go in that's committed that's awful it's from the first movie is it that's actually okay well he's dead here you want to go on this one where would that be get all wacky there's a button on the other side oh there is oh the other side okay so maybe we got to push those two at the same time oh no this just opened that door oh look there's a foot on the floor it's like the first movie oh hey that's very echo yeah i came up with that all on my own why not and then this is the this is the metal wall where the guy like closes it and he goes he goes game over and it's like all reverby remember that that's the room where they have the saw from saw yeah did you know that if i remember correctly the key all right i'll stand on this with you on that thing the drain of this bathtub remember that there's gotta be something in that room sure well this button opens that door but this button opens that door too why would they have two buttons number two written in the [ __ ] house number two because you do number two do you push it with the other red button at the same time all right let's try it ready set yeah [Music] okay let's just open this one maybe it's the first one i understand why these two buttons open the same door these are both pressure plates too for some reason wait it's did you remember to find the clues that's what it says on the wall over here all right i'm going in here so what happens if the door closes behind us are we dead in here guys does this look like the setting from the first movie it's vaguely familiar what is this incredibly low res foot [Music] with the biggest big toe of all time this has to be a clue saw the big toe off look how they sorted off though they wanted an angle all around yeah at the finish all right i think we stand on the two pressure plates and then hit the button over the live that's my guess does that do anything hey wait so you do need three people to do this or maybe it's stand on pad number two and press the button probably all right all right i'll stand on the pad boom oh no i got you i got you [Music] wait no we escaped the room we did the room we escaped the room already now we're in the escape hallway we gotta do the escape hallway though so this is stuck inside the escape room building but there's gotta be something in winter's room time is not on outside sam you wanna come in here no oh wait don't tell me where to come tell me when to come no no you want to know where on top of the table in the fish tank they're eating it the turtle stood what's going in that room there's like lots of doors what's hey what's up as you see him there there's something to pop this open i don't know if i get off the poster chris hanson over here on the wall wait i can paste the sign this is a sign that he complained oh nice sam's just shoveling propaganda yeah yeah double helix genetic research what's up with this uh oh wait biz come here boost me up look at this sam snap out of it he's too deep of the posters the face is missing maybe they're trying to say faceless that other rust guy ah another clue another clue i felt i found the way science beats planets what oh the door's down there you're barely jumping i'm gonna slide you up the wall wait wait you're on a time limit better hiring time is not on your side for that one don't press the button you need me to press it again yeah oh [ __ ] that's me you need to hurry you'll need these arrows work as a team bt dubs i'm not afraid of the dark it actually says btw really dubs yes i hope you're not afraid of the dust oh i think you need to open a door for me uh a door closed there should be a button in that next room or something right ah yeah it's dark in here hold on dude sam you want to come with no it's a labyrinth in the dark all right hold on i don't think sam's gonna help me in here so i'll just navigate the darkness he said there was a button back here i'm trying to find it oh wait i see you guys down below me look up biz i can't see it it's pitch black oh oh you got to guide me all right uh turn 180. this one that do a 180 the other way yup go that way turn right [Music] turn right again go all the way down there's a door in front of you press e uh bit more to your right yep actually yeah all right hey nice should be all right 180 go that way while you're looking left keep going oh wait i can't i can't go straight come back a bit then uh keep coming back the other way yeah yeah turn left right now yep turn right turn right left i think yep uh do a 180 yep go straight turn right turn yeah there you go yeah yeah yeah nice is there a button to get me out of this [ __ ] oh yeah uh there we go that doing it okay i'll check the other side real quick oh [ __ ] the red key card door is here do we need that to let you in i have got the red key cards on me right now button what did i do wait yep that worked but i ran through all the spikes to get you oh no i can send sam in here oh that seems like the next one oh he's in i'm in this uh room [Music] there's a [ __ ] chair in here and [ __ ] there's a button i can push that makes squishy sounds yeah i think we need that look up top yeah i'm up here oh oh oh can you slot the key card oh yeah yeah i can't can you get that i don't think i can hold up i need to boost i can climb up and then [Music] is him trapped forever i think so i can't open them ah [ __ ] i have the arrow but no bow do you have i'm gonna fly i've got a bath force strapped a bit it's an awfully roomy nice big room sometimes and it's got a diesel generator [Music] oh my god that's handsome uh keycard broke so i hope this works [Music] oh [ __ ] now yeah like how do you get in here dude you [ __ ] dove in there you guys need to think with your noodles man you opened the door i thought i'm going in that room ah use the clues from the other rooms unlock the hatch i'm sorry number two what i was trying to tell you before you just ran in there like a couple idiots i don't think you're trying i was wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait just dove in there he's taking that breath before he says something it's two and a door three seven and then i don't know the last well it's two three then something than seven so i guess i could keep drawing yeah there's only nine tries i'd really like to join you guys thank goodness his voice chat is fixed is that doing it i found a whole series of numbers right here really on the side of this it says zero nah that's not what you want but it does it does say zero two three seven oh try that kind oh can you let me in brilliant brilliant thanks come on there's no way it's that number what is this joker wants us to admire his work um [Music] it's a reverse milking machine i would love you to admire my work how am i supposed to put my mean in this do we have to do that what was the card again oh here it is 7-3 wait why is there a 7-1-3 over here you need four digits right on this box so 7-1-3 yeah oh that was easy 7137 are you doing well you have enough time to look around okay we gotta look for more numbers oh wait this flat shelves oh nice is there something outside oh i see it two five eight nine okay i gotta see what you're looking at it's on the rooftop there's big white numbers why don't you guys get on top of the door dummy oh yeah there's a ledge right here too and you guys call yourself rust people i i don't call myself rust people told me a million times you're like i consider myself a rust rust person i am a lead man you said first things this is how i describe myself a rust man and then a veteran four five three six two three seven six is that one two three i hear an auto turret yeah there's another turret on peacekeeper mode i shall slay it with my bow oh yeah oh [ __ ] yeah quick sam come through huh come on restricted area uh we got to jump on top of it i guess i see the number not a number it says epic epic so letter of the alphabet like what letter is he five oh yeah you're a [ __ ] nerd what's the code we missed this one oh nice i shot it quick sam come down this way quick okay i shot the turret with a bow and it worked okay here we go what numbers what do the numbers mean two wait it says two eight seven six are the biggest ones you see can you escape 2876 big diagonal oh my god i got night vision goggles you know they say you can tell how intelligent someone is by how fast they can discern patterns and that one was pretty [ __ ] quick i'm not gonna lie i paid them a lot of money to give me the clues in advance oh yeah and where i can seem really smart yeah when you've got night visions come this way yeah all i can see is your eyes [Music] [Music] some people are so ungrateful to be alive but not you not anymore nope that series of four rooms changed me i remember when i found the big two eight five seven six i would never be the same again yeah perhaps evil dog yes but you could also spell l iv liver alive alive oh a lie yeah yeah true uh but where are we there's no a where's the a and the e button i think that's what we need are there two other buttons around here what's up with the 9451 up there on the other side behind us if there's a place in our code somewhere yeah he's going to try random sequence oh do you think it's that i think it's a-l-i-v-e but we can't hit a or e so we just do liv jesus oh we won i think oh wait the code we smoked it sam go out no [ __ ] oh no oh wait we can press the button i thought we'll distract him all right uh 9451 easy are you sure you want this journey to end nine i kind of want to see what happens off to the top of it [Music] as the old lady said and number nine the choice is yours [Music] all right i'll wait here for seven minutes guys i'm coming [Music] he got spun out same old tell the tales okay they have a very they have a look i told them i told them they're like they need to go through the teleporter door like you did i go they're waiting to see what happens if they don't finish the time and they're just staring dead at me i don't think they have anything planned i think they're like no they it was inconceivable to them that anybody would not finish winter wait we have to hold up our end of the park defend yourself if they come don't let them take us alive it is give them some chelsea grins oh yeah baby let him match my joker baby mouth yeah swipe am i real good i think they're just gonna come in here and kill us with their disappointment i have a feeling they're gonna come in and tell us that all we need to do is touch the spinner yeah and that there's going to be this awkward moment where it's like yeah clearly we we know that we're just waiting to see if there's a finale then i'll probably just quietly walk like slow speed and do i'm going to say that i didn't know i was supposed to touch the spoon could be a trap says congrats set the finish she said it told me probably to see your fate see this is exactly what jigsaw would do though the false ending we got night vision in the bow they made a mistake seconds 30 10 seconds all right dude you're ready yeah cover our entrances what oh it just just points us out we should have just stayed in the first room behold long time no see that was the precursor to the real escape room the real escape room is this place there's no actual exit i haven't been able to figure out any way of getting out of here now let's crack this code this saga continues there is but one escape from this room [Laughter] she's explaining to me that this isn't an escape from once i started just what an escape room would say [Music] i'll fashion a key using sam's flesh the old meat key will work its way through they're messaging you like this is not this is not part of this this is just not sorry sir please you're in the lobby this word was [Music] wait where did you go where the [ __ ] did you go the things i've seen sam's gone too oh oh my god i'm in the horse dimension baby in the upside down can't ride this horse hard put it away wet that ghost that flew up see that ghost not just spooky something strange as good as a foot i mean yeah flying horse normal bed sheet ghosts scary did she just disconnect in her face [Music] you
