greetings survivors and friends shadow franks here with your weekly recycling run of rust development news where we're going deeper than ever before more skins are dropping on twitch and some people are already playing the console version the cutting edge of game development so we just had march's forced wipe which is called freight transit line or fret rancid lin or just ftl if you're in a hurry which could also stand for faster than light or failure to launch depending on your experience because now far below your feet rust has its own underground train system in fact did you know one of these will now be generated on pretty much any map that spawns monuments even as small as 1000 where it's basically just a budget hadron collider cute for a more detailed breakdown of this new underworld please see last week's video but in brief you can now descend via a number of entrances around the map into an interconnected train tunnel system inhabited by a new class of hostile npc known as tunnel dwellers and they really don't like visitors or want you to have a quick and easy journey around the tracks bit like the british rail system a few things have changed since last week though you'll now find a couple of work carts at each station there's now a sexy red version you'll also find tunnel dwellers in more places and their loot has been tweaked but naturally this is all still subject to change if it's determined that you're enjoying yourself too much above ground at the bandit camp slots are in and not a whole lot's changed since i mentioned them last except now they're very much cheaper being only two scrap per spin instead of 10. the winning criteria and amounts have been jiggled too with 1500 scrap being the max payout now and some of the effects are better now we just need some card games and i'm sure this will be a full house also it seems that the console beta has been rolled out to a number of players now for stress testing purposes with more to come later so some people are actually playing the game on console already can you believe at least now the spam switched from when console to gib key for ps4 beta plus but if you haven't got one yet you can still add yourself to the mailing list and hope link will be in the description back to the pc master race version though and the server browser has been improved in short empty servers are now hidden by default exceptions being official friends history and favorite steps but we can of course still choose to show them because sometimes we just want to be alone server tags should look a bit nicer now too with more improvements in the pipeline including ui refresh better filtering and the removal of servers from the list that are spamming advertising or generally being dishonest to get ahead server performance should also be a bit better now it seems boats and horses in particular were clogging things up a bit with the data they were sending out and this has been toned down just when players are around them it was probably the horse's revenge for the team clogging them up i have a rust related sponsor today quick message from them codefling a marketplace for custom plugins maps and tools invites you to check out hundreds of free and premium plugins and maps to help your server stand out so go over and have a good look at codefling.com your links below there were a lot of other changes many of which i've already mentioned but in summary of the most important ones the following are all now in the main game the oil rig rf spam has been fixed there's smoother horse movement over bumpy surfaces boxes can now be placed under mixing tables the compound will no longer spawn in the snow on procedural maps probably because it's a spawn point on soft core servers now loot will reset in puzzle rooms when the puzzles reset the skin picker will now show the last skin you used as first in the list for an item substations at the sides of roads no longer have rads so happy looting drop boxes are easy to deploy on stone walls the heavy helmet no longer covers the chat road sign gloves are now skinnable and indeed there's already one on the store healing other players will now properly show an animation in third person and the marketplace will now charge a fixed fee per order rather than per item which is a lot thriftier what a time to be alive oh yes and family sharing was disabled also this week the next round of twitch drops is on here are the skins on offer and this will run until next thursday 11th of march in works in progress lots more happening on the hdrp back port front along with the reworked ai as well as some more commits about reworking the junkyard and adding a shredder presumably to recycle cars there will be a new convey for admin soon called teleport to death which will take you back to the scene of your last fatality and oh yes electrical is being fixed now why did you have to say about that why couldn't you have just kept slight sorry i suppose i shouldn't say anything about the small medium and large rechargeable batteries either well we know what's going to be in next week's update vid don't we check back then to see
