this is XP Penn's latest pro level graphics tablet and today we're gonna be checking it out I would like to thank in the description until then let's get on with the video this review unit was sent to me by the folks over at XP pen this is the deco pro it's the latest drawing tablet from XP pen it comes in small and medium this one is the medium it's comparable to the Wacom Intuos Pro line but cost significantly less it's about a third of the price so how does it stack up pretty well this product falls into the category of graphics tablets a tablet like an Android or iPad great question mr. rhinoceros this can be confusing because we call iPads and Android tablets tablets so I'm gonna be referring to this as a tablet today too even though it doesn't have a screen is not a big phone you can't watch Netflix on it that's just not what this is for this is for creating digital art you plug it into a Windows Mac or Android device and you could draw on it using the included pen and the lines that you draw on the tablet show up on the computer in front of you this works on Android yeah that's right this also works on Android that really sets it apart from the Wacom Intuos the ability to connect it to an Android phone or tablet and use it that way this is pretty cool for several reasons and I'll touch on those in a little bit but first we've got some specs to rattle off the live drawing area on this medium tablet is 11 inches by 6 inches the pen has over 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity which means the heart of that you press down on the pen the more paint flows out of it the pen supports up to 60 degrees of tilt the pen also is battery free the tablet itself also has eight shortcut keys and can be used in left-handed or and right-handed mode and it's got a virtual wheel that's what they call it but it's a real wheel it turns and it does a lot of other stuff too the tablet itself is really thin but it's sturdy it's made of plastic and also some brushed aluminum because of that aluminum and how different the design is from other tablets I've used this really does feel premium also adding to the premium feel is the wave it lights up when it's plugged in there's this subtle blue glow inside the wheel and also the live area of the tablet lights up at least in the corners these are just subtle design touches that would be really easy to overdo but I think it was handled well here I would have called the tablet heavy it's a little under three pounds though so it is substantial when you pick it up it's also larger than what I was used to when I was using KU Yuans medium sized tablet that I tested a few weeks ago in fact this doesn't feel medium at all it feels kind of large you've got some customisable shortcut keys along the side you can set those to any keyboard shortcut your little heart desires I do need to talk about this wheel because there is more going on here then first meets the eye it looks like a simple wheel but they've added some extra functionality to it it's actually a double wheel so for example I can map the outside of the wheel like I did to my brush size so if I scrub it one way and makes the brush larger if I spin the wheel another way it makes the brush smaller but that's not all it does the inside of the wheel at the top of it this little grayish black part that's actually a touch wheel so currently I have them active scrolling so if I circle around one way it'll scroll up if I circle around the other way with my finger it'll scroll down that too is customizable so if you wanted to set it to zoom or something else you can totally do this let's talk about this pen it's got a brushed aluminum highlights to match the tablet and it's your standard drawing pen there are two shortcut keys alongside and like the tablet itself these are also customizable it feels pretty good to draw with so let's go to the pen test and check it out first thing I do it's like get a pen that has a nice thick line on it and so that way I can just test the pressure and see how that works and overall it works well it seems like the pressure goes up gradually if I press really lightly I get a lighter line and then as I add pressure the line gets thicker and thicker and it's very easy to control the amount of pressure that this pen has the other thing that I take a look at is how does this pressure hold around curves can I hold like a medium pressure if I'm drawing a circle can I hold a heavier pressure can I hold really light pressure around a circle those sorts of things I'm looking for too as you can see here it's working pretty well that's what I'm looking for in a pen I also want to check out how this does with fast lines are there in a check mark says how is it tapering at the end of the line overall it's doing pretty well I noticed that some of these lines it tapers kind of quickly but not in any kind of really poor way I think if I was drawing hatch lines I'd probably go with like lighter lines anyway where that doesn't show up so overall I'm pretty impressed with this pen so far so let's take a look at what happens when we try to do our straight line angled tests usually I just freehand these a little bit to see if there's any wobble or jitter and then I'm gonna grab a ruler after I've done a couple of these just to see what happens overall there might be a little bit of wave in there let's check it out with a ruler and see what we get and overall I'm not really seeing any I get some a little bit here and there but I think for the most part it's kind of the bumpiness of the ruler and things like that that's that are happening every so often I get like a little bow in the line but that might just be the ruler because I'm not seeing like a uniform wave maybe a tiny bit picked up here but not not a whole lot I think overall this this pen performs very very well as expected this also comes with a pen holder you screw off the top and you can nestle the pen back inside of it but if you screw off the bottom you're gonna unveil the extra replacement nibs that the pen comes with so if your current nib wears down from you switch and inevitably eventually will there's plenty of extra nibs to replace it oh I think it's time to talk about the Android features of this tablet this is something I touched on on my who yawn hs6 100 review a couple weeks ago because it had a very similar set of features so this thing works pretty much the same way you plug in your favorite Android device and like magic it just works no extra apps needed no drivers you need to install nothing it just works it takes advantage of some of the native hardware that's already installed on Android at least newer versions of Android from marshmallow up I'm not talking about the candy and talking about the operating system Google names our operating system after sweet things that you want to eat no I'm really hungry too let's take a snack break [Music] in the box there are two different kinds of adaptors as long as your phone has a USB C port or a micro B port you should be pretty good to go if you don't have one of those you could probably still use this but you're gonna want to jump on Amazon or somewhere else and pick up an adapter those are pretty cheap this tablet natively supports any Android app the supports pen pressure sketchbook prochik eyebath panorex check infinite painter check I'm probably missing one or two 12 you're missing 12 there are some caveats not every single feature on this tablet is going to work on Android but most words it's just the drawing features for example the shortcut keys and the fancy wheel along the side those aren't gonna work it's pretty much the pen in the pen pressure that's gonna work here the hue on tablets that I reviewed use it only a portion of the tablet space while you were drawing on Android this one uses the entire drawing area and you should really turn your tablet sideways since you're gonna be drawing in portrait view this is a fair amount of space to map to a smaller screen so it took me some time to get used to but I can really see the benefit I'm used to making my tiny strokes even smaller but here's the opposite a tiny stroke comes out even tinier on the the links down below and the code brad Colo all right Brad so why is this Android feature so cool why am i excited about seeing who yawn and XP pen going down this Android route well it's very simple and that is this hobby digital illustration could be really expensive you need to own a computer or buy a computer then you need to buy some kind of piece of hardware whether it's a screen based tablet or a graphics tablet like this to draw on either that or invest in something like an Android tablet that already has a pen or an iPad or a Microsoft Surface type thing like a Windows all-in-one most people already have a smart phone that the in their pocket so the fact that you can get a fairly inexpensive graphics tablet and plug it into your phone and use it that way really lowers the barrier for entry for anybody who wants to create digital art I will say this if you're only going to draw on Android this is probably not the tablet you want to get in this case the feature is just a bonus on the deco Pro it is nice to have but it isn't necessary if you're going to use this primarily on a Windows or a Mac computer and then maybe also on Android too great it's perfect for that but don't get this if you're only going to be using it on Android and the reason I say this is that there are cheaper options out there and all the things that make this tablet cool and special don't really work on Android shortcut buttons the fancy wheel even the large drawing space isn't really needed on a tiny phone screen if you're going to be drawing only on Android it's probably better going off with the cheaper XP pen star g64 0s or some of the smaller hue on tablets that do this too all right let's get on to the pros and cons as far as the pros go this feels premium it draws great it has the Android feature that's a big plus it definitely looks nice they even want some design Awards so it's not just me who thinks it looks and feels premium and really there aren't many cons here I feel like we've reached peak graphics tablet in fact I think we reached it years ago while there are a lot of places for their more expensive screen base siblings to improve I'm not really sure I can come up with ways to make this better than it already is it it does exactly what it says it doesn't it doesn't well as much as I like Wacom I don't really see a huge advantage of the Intuos Pro line over something like this and of course if you have any comments or questions let me know down below in the comment section it's all I got for today thanks guys for watching and I'll see you in a couple of days [Music]
