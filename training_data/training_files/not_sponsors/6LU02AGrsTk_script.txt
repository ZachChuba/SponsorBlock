welcome back everyone this is stephan on the french cooking academy and this week we're going to be talking and learning about mustard and more precisely dejan mustard so if you want to know a little bit of the history it comes from and how to make your own mustard at home keep watching now let's talk about mustard now i'm sure you all know mustard that is the yellow stuff you'll find on your hot dogs for instance if you use fast food or in french cooking if you make a rabbit with mustard sauce which is one of the recipes you can see on the link above that we've made before it's a very common spice and it's been around in france we're going to be talking about france since the 13th century it's actually the oldest spice with the peppers it's a very very old now in recipes uh in french recipe in general the one thing you're going to see all the time is dijon mustard and the abbreviation is always like oh use a two tablespoon of dijon and you may not know what does that mean exactly a dijon mustard well dejen or dijon in french is the name of the town where the mustard is made right it is a town in burgundy that's got a lot of specialties and a lot of gastronomy going on in there and mustard is by far one of the greatest specialty there is but in france we don't say mustard or mutard we say mustard with an s because in the burgundy region and indigen there's actually dozens and dozens of different types of mustard so okay so we've learned that mustard comes from dijon and other part but dijon in burgundy is the one town in france that really the mustard is really really prominent and it is there proud and joy the recipe has been guarded by some very strict orders called the order of the mustards and vinegar makers for a century in the most recent times a group of purists i think in 1996 tried to create a new fellowship called the fellowship of the dejan mustard and it's not a joke here they are look on the screen with their beautiful yellow uniform and their role here is to defend the recipe and how to make the mustard from dijon and from the burgundy region so they always try to protect these original recipes so that they don't get lost in time and that a lot of people tend to change them you know they make they add elements in it that don't belong like flour garlic onions all kinds of things so they are there to protect that recipe to make sure we eat a proper mustard but of course when we talk about this recipe what exactly is the recipe of making mustard well you'll be surprised that actually making mustard in a dijon style is actually very simple and you can do this at home and that is exactly what we're gonna do right now so as we look at the history of mustard and the provenance let's have a look at the core ingredients what is mustard at its core mustard is made with this these are mustard seeds if you've been cooking indian food this is very common they can be bought online on some many shops and they keep very well they come from a plant as you can see on the screen it's called the mustard plant and it's just a simple plant's got the yellow flower and when it goes to seed will basically produce these little fruits and they're actually fruits the seeds of the plant and they can be white brown or black ones the black ones being the strongest one so you have to harvest first these seeds in order to make the mustard but how do you transform this into mustard which is very simple you have to grind them now making your own mustard at home is surprisingly easy and does not require much ingredients or what you need is in front of you so we're gonna have the mustard seeds that you're gonna have to put in water for at least two hours a few tablespoons of white wine a few tablespoon of white wine vinegar a teaspoon of rock salt and of course a pestle and mortar i'll put all the precise ingredients in the video description now the first thing you have to do is of course to drain the mustard seeds and put them in the sieve before we can grind them as you can see they were black but because they are dry seeds the good thing of put them in water for two hours and we're gonna soften the seeds a little bit and we're also gonna add in that mix a little bit of moisture that's gonna be much needed because we're gonna have to grind this okay so you're gonna take everything and immediately we're going to start to put everything in and start grinding the mix now once the seeds are in of course we're going to start mashing the whole lot nadi the meal that's used is much different and it's much bigger so this is not maybe the perfect tool but when you're at home that's all what we have so what we're going to do is always this crushing and circular motion to really kind of break open all of these seeds now i've been at it for a good five minutes and let me tell you you need some good elbow grease and it takes a really really long time but you can see the color so what we are making is the old-fashioned mustard that's got this grain and this is like the dijon mustard you can buy with the grain but you see that kind of yellowish color and the mustard starts to appear so if i grind like that look at this see this all that kind of yellow color starting that is the mustard so i'm going to keep on grinding to trying to make that paste as fine as i can all right so it's been 10 minutes of grinding i'm not there yet but look at this i see it looks more like a mustard now and you can now start to incorporate a little bit of liquid you can use water um but i like to use white wine and i'm gonna keep on adding liquid in there and then grind again and to make sure i extract all of these juices all right let's take a break from the grinding that's i've added all the wine it's still very very thick but it starts to be extremely pungent and look at this this is a real i don't know if you can see but this is a real paste and from here basically we've got the the base kind of paste that we want and you can keep on adding a little bit more wine a little bit more water i'm gonna add a little bit of my vinegar here and it's a bit like making a dressing and so we're going to start adding the ingredients so a bit of vinegar a bit of salt and again take our a mortar here and we're going to keep on grinding so the finer and the longer you grind the more you're gonna kind of slowly emulsify the whole mix the mustard grain with the rest and it's gonna get finer and fun if you want something coarse you can just stop here and add more liquid to get the concentrate you want and keep that kind of grindiness but i think i want to keep on going a little bit to have something a little bit more fine okay so here we are we've got our base paste and this is what you need to have we added a bit of vinegar a bit of white one a bit of salt and from here it is all about adjusting the quantities to your own taste but before we do that we need to try the mustard [Music] oh strong oh if you want a strong mustard it's like wasabi gee well okay uh still you know what a little bit bitter i think to my taste um i got a bit of salt in there and i think definitely i think i'm gonna add some vinegar definitely it's a bit more vinegar in here and i'm gonna mix that okay so it's all about what you like and if you have a little bit of bitterness it is said it is normal you can add a tiny weeny bit of sugar to break that down okay operation mustard is now complete i've added actually a little bit of sugar that has really really improved that kind of bitterness and plenty of vinegar but of course like this if you leave it like this you got that kind of look of the old-fashioned mustard so what we're gonna do here we're going to pass this through sieve to really get that standard mustard consistency in the one you know from the dejan mustard because we want something nice and smooth lastly in order to transform your old fashioned mustard into a more modern version you just put the mustard through a sieve like this and with a spoon you're gonna press down and the result should be look at that the nice mustard that we know lovely and here we are so i did just one pass i've got still plenty of grains i could do a second pass but look at the results it is quite actually uh i'm astonished to see that this is really mustard from the shop look at this this dejan style mustard now look at this it's amazing and oh no i need to try it again let's see still very hot but taste wise much much better definitely so my advice when the mustard comes together is at the end when you mix with your spoon and you start to fine-tune your mustard a little bit of vinegar a little bit of wine maybe a little bit of pepper in there it's interesting because you could come up with some very very interesting flavors and you could have like a real kind of a personal mustard the type you like i feel like acidic or sweeter that sort of thing but it's brilliant look at this and that's it we've done we've made a dejan style mustard from scratch all right so i'm gonna put this in a nice little container and we'll wrap up the lesson and here we are we've got our little pot of mustard so to wrap up the video i like to say that you're not supposed to consume mustard has been made like this straight away it needs to mature in the fridge for three or four days you would cover it or put it in a sealed container and uh leave some time for the aromas to mix together and for that bitterness slappiness to go away and all the the taste and the strength need to diminish a little bit but all in all it is not that difficult and you could come up with your own version using maybe like yellow mustard seed plus black mustard seeds use different condiments and really make it your own so my advice if you don't have french mustard at home give this a shot because it is absolutely beautiful and it's totally organic but that's it for me as always if you have any questions drop me a comment in the comment section if you make that mustard share the picture on instagram french cook academy and a little announcement to tell you very quickly that on the 27th of this month there is a new course coming on the school that is all dedicated to learning the basic on how to make french desserts so look forward to that and i'll see you all next week for another french cooking video take care all bye [Music] you
