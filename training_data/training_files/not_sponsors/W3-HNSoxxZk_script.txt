all right so I'm back with two main goals this morning it was raining pretty good so I'm going to see how well it picks up the traffic lights and stop signs on autopilot so we'll see how it does and see how the stop signs show up in the rain yeah so serious it's nice enough to tell me it's raining smart the stop sign shows up good it seems to be doing fine with autopilot and detecting stop signs stop line and that one seems a little bit far back so far no difference in the rain every stop sign see if we can't have missed it before so that's good to green shut up mr. green all right so it does show up to red lights and to red arrows Tartu probably on on the camera there but it does pick up these accurately one thing they thought about it is the placement of it so some reason this lights is a lot closer I guess it doesn't really matter because it is displaying the four lights correctly this one for the lane we're in this one four lane next to us and then the two turn lanes but it is odd that that one's so much farther so much further forward [Music] now dropped with autopilot there two green lights and a blinking yellow arrow shows up perfectly all the lights seem to be showing up just how they normally do no problem with the brain still detects the lights fine I'm gonna take a little side road here see how it does the stop sign it's very covered by the tree there but I had no problem picking it up here's the stop sign okay so they're picks up for some reason to stop signs right on top of each other [Music] better to detect two stop signs you can see here that basically I would say the reverse camera is almost worthless all the water that builds up on it I mean you can't hardly tell the cars behind here anything possibly the reverse camera is Lisa more important when you're moving forward but they still gotta do something about the screen cameras see how the other cameras look but had to saves the dash cam there to see what the other cameras look like the reverse cameras a totally covered [Music] alright here we are back at the infamous parking lot with the crazy stop signs let's see if in the rain it picks everything up just as a dead floor these people just fine that's good here's a stop line in a stop sign here's another stop sign on the opposite side of this crosswalk there's a stop line this stop line it doesn't not pick up except the stop sign and this stop line is where it should be that's accurate another stop sign stop line that looks accurate [Music] didn't want to see that car until I thought it was like us overall it did pick up the science just as well I think in the rain as it did with good weather thanks for watching please if you liked it thumbs up give it a thumbs up and subscribe and I'll catch you on the next one [Music]
