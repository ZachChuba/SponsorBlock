well my name is Colin Furze and welcome back 
to the world of tanks screw tank project now if   you haven't seen this is one of my favorite 
projects go on to the channel this forever   videos subscribe click the notifications on 
and you can see how I felt a screw tank from   the ground up Naren one of the advantages 
of screw tanks is they can float only mine   doesn't yet so we do need to do something about 
this don't we yeah we got to shift the weight   distribution forward and we've got to add 
a little bit more buoyancy and that is what   we're gonna do in this video now don't forget 
the sponsor World of Tanks millions of people   all possible right then let's go map this tank 
flat Gallina improve the center of gravity move   the seat forward move the levers forward turn the 
engine round and put the oil tank behind the seat basically what we need to do now to make 
this float is make this bottom bit into a   boat so we need to give it like a base and 
a kind of a key or a hole or whatever it's   called and to do that we've got the bead 
roller what would it to the floor I've made   a flat bead for the bottom here and we're 
gonna use that as like a bender as a guide   to bend the sheet to go under there we've 
had a little test it seems to work so good well that's kind of made like a top chassis which 
are little tubs gonna come up and weld too before   we get too far I'm gonna make the bit that goes on 
the tops I'm gonna put the engine back in kind of   make that and then make that like a separate 
piece that comes off and then do some stuff in a bit more tank right now I'd say alright yeah 
that's this topic then that's a separate piece   that did put some mesh on it but don't ever like 
it so I'm gonna get the boat bit done the bottom   of this tank in all sorted and then we'll we'll 
look at it after that because I think it looks   a bit sparse at the moment can't make a proper 
judgment on it right let's get all that welded   it made serve it on then probably take it to 
the river and give it a float test as well come on you just drank use your power come   on you keep saying you're gonna 
destroy me and you've got power okay well within stone seats back in engines 
fitted in bolt the screws back on dunk it in   the river see if it leaks see if it floats 
and then whatever happens from there we'll   just have to deal with it won't we Colin 
yes we will we will have to deal with   you I have to drag it out the bottom 
you might we might never see it again yeah bits of walk coming in the 
back that everything that might   be through the bulbs it's bit really 
think I need to get in and sit in it they still have rear evias hell yeah we've got a 
bit of water going in drums I can see the bubbles   coming out the top but it does float it's just 
the weight distribution is still a little bit   rearward and we've got a few leaks so we filled 
the tub up with water so we can see where the   little pinholes are we've welded them up we've 
also give it a lick of paint the screws they got   quite a bit of water in them so we've gone round 
all the seams now all the bolts seal them all   up so hopefully it's gonna be a bit better with 
also adding a little flotation buoyancy adaption   to the back just to try and lift it up a little 
bit and try and get it a little bit more level I think we're under a winner here 
we're sitting a lot more level it's   not filling up with water we've not got 
bubbles coming out of anything I'd say   those wind people right hydraulics 
got to go back in there make it work oh yeah she's finished got a paint job looks a 
bit more tank like hydraulics in new oil tank   fantastic fits in there a treat but is he gonna 
flow is he gonna propel itself in the water isn't   gonna be the ultimate all-terrain vehicle World 
of Tanks have got all sorts of trains in their   game so this it's gotta be able to do the same 
thing let's have a go we've got a bog they sit okay past the swamp desk but it's not 
actually fly a because he's sitting   in the mud so we need to take it some 
deeper water let's get out of here first you can't fault this machine it is fantastic okay we're nearly there in terms of its off-road 
capabilities and driving and stuff I'm happy   with it it's exactly where I'd want it to 
be Colin you've not finished up yeah it's   not gonna weapon on it no we need to match 
something we're gonna fire some stuff now   you've requested flamethrowers and potato 
guns seems to be the top answer so I think   we're gonna go with one of them probably a 
potato gun but I don't want to be just be a   normal potato gun no I won't be a first potato 
gun which hopefully it will be better than a   normal potato gun yes now then don't forget the 
sponsor use your promo code tantastic get all   your free stuff go and check the game out it's 
very historical they've got hundreds of foul I   think it's 500 tanks have got it you know you 
can't even talk there's like 500 tanks in the   game it's like it's a massive game so but 
you know support them they're supporting the   channel they're making this on this possible 
I don't see you in the next video people yeah
