the Noi to restart update added a variety of interesting new features and mechanics including some new secrets today we're gonna take a quick look at some of these remember the game is still in early access for a little while longer meaning all of this is subject to change also some of these can be considered spoilers so please watch at your own risk up first let's talk about a few of these new perks the trick Blood Money and gold is forever perks energized very well with both of these as long as creatures die from accidental means then healing blood money will drop and never disappear and it just so happens that the spikes from the spore pod spell and tablet throws count as accidental pills the levitation trail perk also has a very interesting synergy can combine it with the glass cannon and homing shots perks as well as with berserk young to have homing death Blazers fly off your feet as levitate can use this in conjunction with a COO in order to capture and release these death lasers at will by simply switching away from the COO in your hotbar just be very careful when fighting all three eyes with this setup speaking of the coup the coos gravity now attracts all physics bodies making certain endeavors way easier it can even now be used to attain clunky but infinite flight by pulling any physical object and then carefully landing on it mid-flight to replenish levitation energy the telekinetic kick perk replaces your kick with telekinetic powers useful for grabbing gold or flasks from a distance for completing certain secrets or for combat probably the most useful method is to carry a tablet around with since can not only launch it at enemies to deal damage but can also use it as a very effective shield a new substance has been added in this update helium which is produced when healthy Emma or lively concoction are introduced to heat the resulting helium gas will heal very quickly making it a viable strategy if can obtain either help ium or LC to carry around the flask of one of these mixed with either fire or lava speaking of substances a rare one from the feast update urine now has a new property if consume it or stain yourself with it are granted the jarate effect a tf2 reference sense an increased danger of being hit with a critical so just be careful when playing with jars of pee the desert music machine from the east update is now part of a set of for each playing different music one kick the first one again is in the desert past the pyramid [Music] the second in the small fish pond east of spawn [Music] the third on top of the giant tree along with some curious balloon fungi [Music] and the fourth on the island in the middle of the lake nearby innocent creatures are attracted to and affected by this music yet either afflicts them with confusion or with charm interestingly enough other than that I've not been able to find any other effects in all of my experimentation with these music machines and trust me I've tried a lot of different things they likely were just added to both honor the musicians as well as to celebrate the release of volume 2 of the official soundtrack or maybe they'll eventually have another news finally we come to literally the final secret I know of in the current incarnation of the entire game west of the Minds past the dark cave through the twisty passages at this bottom corner beneath the snow and above the dense rock we can find this curious symbol a dollar sign at the top of what looks like a downwards pointing arrow unfortunately this doesn't seem to lead to anything in particular glyph number 12 is down beneath the EDR left of the temple but that's it bringing a lot of gold to this area also doesn't seem to have any effect at all it could be something that's not fully implemented yet like in the code of this area there's an unused reference to an NPC shopkeeper but that's been in the code since the beginning and this symbol was just recently added instead of an arrow it could also be a hint at acquiring gold that the floating island mountain alter by dumping tablets on top of it since this also kind of looks like that if have any ideas let me know down below in the comments please anyway the full 1.0 release of the game is apparently coming pretty soon and I'll be continuing to play it and cover it in as many videos as I can possibly make so much more annoyed to content on the way on this channel anyway guys thank very much for watching I hope have a great day and I'll see next time
