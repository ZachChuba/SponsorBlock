by Squarespace welcome friends welcome back to Sunday morning and the old
cookbook show today we're going to do something out of the 1915 edition of
five roses cookbook and we're gonna do something today called railway cake now
if you haven't watched these videos before what I do is I choose a recipe
out of these books and then make it only according to what the recipe
instructions are I often have no idea what the cake is or what the recipe is
or what the end product should taste like or be like and I don't do any
modern-day research I only follow the instructions that are in the book or
with whatever knowledge I already have and it often ends up in a little bit of
disaster like it might today so railway cake never heard of it before I'm very
interested to find out what this tastes like because it's got some strange
flavor additions but the first problem is the cake says six ounces of butter
and lard and I couldn't figure out if that was six ounces each or six ounces
total so I've gone with six ounces of each and we'll see what happens so I'm
going to put that into the stand mixer and we're gonna start creaming it okay
now that those are softened and creamed together I'm going to add the sugar and
continue creaming okay looks like it's all creamed together so I put in the
eggs one at a time and beat them in completely before the next one goes in
while the eggs are beating in I'm just going to mix together the dry
ingredients which is baking soda and cream of tartar just mix that into the
flour and you don't have to mix it in really well just sort of get it mixed
into the top layer okay looking good so I'm going to alternate between mixing in
the dry and the milk spoon a little dried there's a little little milk go
back and forth three four additions should do it now the last two editions are caraway
seeds which I'm kind of not too sure about and candied peel so I really
didn't know what to expect with this cake batter because the caraway seeds
threw me and I was expecting something that might have been a little thicker
and bready or like a like I don't know what I was expecting so I'm not sure
what this cake wants to be is it savory or is it sweet we're gonna find out so
I've got a 9 by 9 may not be the right pan because you don't get directions
does tell me to put it in a quick oven for an hour so nine by nine pan with a
parchment sling I'll just move this out to the edges and get it into the oven
and see what happens this episode of thanks Squarespace thank you not cut for the straight line
okay my friends so this is a railway cake I have done no research to find it
why it's a railway cake that's quite interesting so has fruit in it yes I
figured that it and seeds can appeal in caraway seeds I don't know about the
caraway seeds oh you'll be surprised carries actually lovely hmm hmm mind you
if you don't like caraway seeds this is definitely not for you hmm
I remember when I was a little kid my mom loved this cheese that had caraway
seeds in it and as a little kid I hated the flavor of caraway well I also see
eight caraway with savory but it actually works in this doesn't it really
good mm-hmm yeah it's always good with other things
right a little honey that's that's interesting because I'd never would have
put caraway in a sweet cake and expected it to work so no clue why it's called
the railway kick I know that there are there's an Irish cake called a railway
cake but it's more of a soda bread than a cake okay so this is not from the same
this is not a random name yeah and and another thing that I think is really
cool is this is the 1915 edition of this book so this is at the beginning of the
First World War Canada is firmly part of the British Empire at this point yes I'd
say two-thirds of these recipes are by weight rather than by volume interesting
but when you get to the post-world War one version of this cookbook they are
all by volume we've done a complete shift you know the world always changes
everything that's going to I suspect everything's gonna change back to being
wait I I would hope I hope that everything changes back to wait because
I actually found it making this by weight to be so much easier than using
volume there you go so a railway cake something a little unusual
yeah unusual yeah I don't know but a nice thing maybe
a glaze on this but I don't know that it needs it because this really is a cheat
this is an afternoon tea cake this is this is that a lot but yeah this one
truly is this is not a fancy cake this is something that you just sort of roll
out when your aunt comes over on the railway on the railway huh there you go
thanks for stopping by see you again soon you
