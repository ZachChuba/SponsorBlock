hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with butterscotch budino that's right i'm gonna show my take on this
amazing italian custard pudding and by the way if were thinking budino was
like an adorable italian word for some adorable thing it's not apparently it
comes from a medieval word for sausage so we might just have to make up our own
story for what that word means which when it comes to recipes is totally fine
but anyway let's go ahead and get started with this very simple recipe and
what we'll do first is add one very firmly packed 1/2 cup of brown sugar to
the saucepan and if it comes out too quickly did not pack it firm enough we
will also go ahead and add some salts which because I'm using one that has a
large flakey grain looks like a lot more than it really is
and then last but not least we will add a splash of water and we'll set our heat
to medium high and for some reason I gave this a stir with the whisk which
really isn't necessary and all I really accomplished here was getting that sugar
on the sides of the pan which is why as this came up to temperature i swirled it
around a few times to wash that stuff down but anyway what we're gonna do is
bring this up to a boil on medium high heat and what we'll do is cook this for
about seven to ten minutes or until the mixture darkens and smells like
caramelized sugar and one will start really paying attention is when our
bubbles start to increase in size which means our water is boiling out of the
mixture and the temperature of that sugar is rising and what we're looking
for here besides bigger and bigger bubbles is it the color of the mixture
will darken so those are our visual clues but as that happens this will also
start to smell like caramelized sugar which is exactly the point I was at
right here which I believe took me about eight or nine minutes and once that
happens we will immediately turn off the heat and we'll go ahead and carefully
toss in a chunk of butter and start stirring with a whisk while we grab and
carefully pour in our heavy cream and the reason we're going a little bit slow
here is because when pour liquid into a caramelized sugar it can really
bubble in foam up pretty quickly so got to be careful and because my cream
is right out of the fridge the sugar is almost immediately gonna seize up which
basically means harden up and it's gonna stick to the pan and mostly to the whisk
but that's a okay don't worry because we're gonna
turn our heat back on in the medium low and as our cream heats back up that
sugar will dissolve and our whisk will become clean yes and of course can
heat the cream up first and significantly less than that effect but
why add an extra step when we don't have to
so you'll see just keep stirring and everything will work out just fine and
by the way let me apologize for the pans which I splattered with some butter and
flour making an unrelated recipe and I didn't realize they were in the frame
but in fairness while I did get them dirty
I also made them more delicious but anyway we're gonna stir that on
medium-low until our sugar dissolves at which point we're gonna go ahead and add
a little bit of milk which I guess we could add it with the cream but for
whatever reason I like to add it here and that's it we'll stir that in and
simply let this sit on medium-low while we mix up our egg and cornstarch
thickener so into a mixing bowl we will add one whole egg plus two egg yolks
followed by our cornstarch and then what we'll do is take a whisk and mix this
until it's very very smooth which is gonna take a minute or two all right
cornstarch does not like to get mixed into things quickly I mean it's kind of
a jerk about it but if keep whisking and whisking and whisking eventually all
those lumps will break up and dissolve and eventually it will look like this
and then once that happens we're gonna do something that we call the business
tempering the mixture which simply means whisking in about a cup of our hot cream
mixture from the stove and when do yours try not to drip and what this does
is not only dilute the amount of eggs but it also raises the temperature which
allows this after tempering to transfer the contents of the bowl back into the
saucepan without us having to worry about those eggs curdling and then once
we have everything together we will raise our heat to medium-high and we
will cook whisking constantly for about two minutes or so or until our mixture
thickens up and if everything goes according to plan after a couple minutes
your mixture should look a little something like this
very beautifully thick and luxurious with no big chunks of scrambled egg and
at this point we can pull it off the stove and then pass that through a fine
mesh strainer just in case although if I being honest this is probably totally
unnecessary since the next time find any major chunks in that strainer
will be the first but anyway better safe than sorry and by passing it through we
do guarantee our mixture will be perfectly smooth and then once that's
been accomplished we go ahead and add our last ingredient which is the liquor
and of course since we're making a butterscotch budino we'll go ahead and
add one tablespoon of rum and I should mention dark rum would be more
traditional but I'm usually white since that's all I have and the sad thing is I
could have bought a bottle and expensed it but anyway both works so use what you
want I mean are after all the Chris
Constantino of your butterscotch budino now that's a chef that knows about
medieval sausage but anyway we will whisk in our rum and then carefully
neatly transfer this into whatever serving glasses were gonna use and
because this is such a rich dessert I'm gonna use these rocks glasses but just
fill them up halfway which i think is a perfect portion it will also hopefully
give them a more dramatic presentation and then because I'm gonna top these
with a little bit of optional caramel sauce later I decided to take a spoon
and give em a little stir to smooth out the top which sort of worked but it also
ended up smearing it up on the sides of the glass so maybe don't stir so hard if
want to cleaner line and that's it once we have those portioned we will
give them the whole tap a tappa followed by the old wrapper rapa and
we'll go ahead and pop those in the fridge for a few hours or until very
thoroughly chilled before we try to serve these and then once these are
ice-cold and if firmed up we could if we want to serve them as is or with some
whipped cream but what I'm gonna recommend is topping these with a spoon
or caramel sauce and know what because made these
from scratch we're going to let use the caramel sauce and the squeeze bottle
from the store if want but homemade caramel sauce is very easy and we have a
video for that so if want to make a little bit of homemade like I did you
really should and I will add a link for how to do that and then what I did after
topping with that is I kind of tipped the glass around so that caramel would
maybe cover up my imperfect edges which sort of worked but then I remember this
is an Italian dessert and it's not supposed to look perfect all right
that's much more their French friends to the north thing but anyway we'll garnish
those with a little bit of caramel sauce and then we'll place those back into the
fridge until we're ready to serve which I'm going to do right now and because
salted caramel is one of my favourite things
i garnished the top of the pinch of extra-large flaky sea salt and that's it
our butterscotch budino is ready to enjoy so let me go ahead and grab a
spoon and dig in to what is truly one of the world's great desserts and above and
beyond that rich decadent butterscotch flavor the texture here is unbelievable
I mean to say it's smooth and luxurious does not even come close to doing it
justice which reminds me if want to adjust to make it a little firmer
that just means adding a little more corn starch or if wanted it a little
softer and creamier could just add a little less corn starch but for me this
was absolutely perfect just pure luxury on a spoon and while this is very rich
and satisfying it really is not overly heavy and since it's nice and cold
borderline refreshing which because these are made ahead of time makes them
an absolutely perfect summertime dessert oh and by the way remember earlier
when I said we should probably come up with another story for what the word
budino means well as I was eating this I came up with mine all right according to
me budino is the Italian word for one of those beautiful puffy clouds at sunset
that takes on the golden hue of the falling Sun that's what the name budino
comes from so feel free to use that one if he wants or come up with something
different on your own but either way I really do hope give this a try soon
