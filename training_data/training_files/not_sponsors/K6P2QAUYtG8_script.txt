hi everyone the lone wolf here and welcome back to evil line in today's video well it is time let's head into revolt the system that is currently really being invaded by the trickle avians we actually have if I go over here the escalating liminality that's going on and so they are basically in their first phase towards that final liminality and you may have seen the screenshots float around they should be doing stuff at the star there so let's go in let's see if there's anything that we can spot and since it will be a low 6 system not with all of the rules but basically Concord security response level in the destination has been this nation system has been increased from point 6 to point 3 because it is being invaded you accept the risk by jumping through the gate let's say yes let's hope that there is no massive gate jump instant locking shenanigans waiting for us here that seems to be ok and we are immediately going to try and play it safe head straight for one of the planets then we're going to cloak back up notice that 27 doesn't grab me we do have a red here Imperial Navy so they're still fighting against the the Eden come forces here to try and wrestle control back but look at that we are really closing in here trick Levien's are winning I also watched a stream from Bjorn B who was running a fleet that was doing content I think you're helping the trick Levens very cool very very impressive impressive super intense as well 200 plus people running like empire sinusoidal beacons lots of major empires are sore because F things like that as well and then eventually at the store that's where the I think they also did some some other stuff observed your flash points and things like that so if they had to take on threats hundred fifty people in local that's quite a lot and yep keep in mind if I'm like discovered then we could be in trouble the reason why I went to a planet first is so I don't have the same alignment as a gate when I now warp to the start to go and take a look at that do I have to star in my overview yep there it is Rivero store warp within 100 and now chances are a lot lower that I warp into another ship that also worked at 100 from the gate and so hopefully we can get in there there is a claw a hundred kilometers away from me so they may already see that I'm here and be trying to to hunt me this would be one of the the warp points that I would have chosen of course if they had like someone on the gate watching and look at that this store is being changed and anything too close nope 600 kilometers that feels like it should be okay and yeah that is one dark star here with red actually in here as well and what the hell order to reclaim is doing to this store I have no idea but it is very impressive and we actually have a resna Borg starving Road Eva that's roaming around so part of the roaming fleet so if you like absolutely here we've got a Reaper here and all of these are actually heading towards that Astra who's where do I have talking rights here you have docking access so I could go over there as well and do I see what's the trick Levens are doing to the store oh look at that we do have a big beam going into the store from somewhere over here and can I spot or find a warp on point stellar fleet deployment sites my country defines there is an Astra who's here do I have docking rights there let's see I think I do that's a bigger fleet coming in with the malls back here and what's happening up here we get quite a few Imperial wrecks interesting let's go take a quick look and we actually have someone that's thank you I know that has a structure here so that's what's happening we get patrols and what the hell is that that I've never seen that before does Khalid kolyada let's do a show info what is this discreet so we don't get a lot here until the appearance of vessels of parent of the kolyada class to live in industrials and logistical operations that normally been observed to be automated or carried out by adapted tactical blade ships so this is Dietrich Le'Veon transport ship very cool definitely worth a quick screenshot as well let's do like that and that's my first sighting of it so right here in rava rose I believe it's called you can't even see it now because it's a trick Libyan version of the name and then over here we've got yeah alright trick live Ian icons on the structure as well and this one video science and reserve facility it is vulnerable they don't seem to be doing anything at this is cool look at that and then right here we get this fear again of course that's powering the whole ship and there's nothing too close there's nothing too close I'm cloaked very important here so that's ok and this is basically what we are at the moment speculating about of course what are the three clave Ian's doing to this star and an interesting theory that I read is that they're basically trying to change this star to turn its isogen 5 which presumably is a natural occurrence in these blue high-power stars and to basically force it to compress even more and to turn that aizen 5 into isagen 10 which is presumably the basis of their technology their power source and so what's the step after that of course we have no idea on that and let's see if the mall as the model is keeping distance that's good and there's is there like another one here this is the one I'm looking at at the moment anything else you know and will it actually dock it is slowly heading towards this Astra who's but not really on a docking Viktor so yeah one of the theories at the moment is that three clearance are basically changing this star so that it creates a surgeon 10 and then of course the real question becomes what's the goal then will this become like a resource operation for them and become like their main system from each table start to perhaps build out stations and structures and larger fleets and things like that if they reach that final liminality or is this somehow something that's going to allow them to pull part of their existing structures from the abyss into our space that could be cool as well or is it some sort of a constant gateway towards the abyss that they are creating that's I think a possibility as well either way for DMR this is not good news look at that Ammar is just six jump out of here so they should be pretty damn worried we do have a lot of tree living activity very very close to here and the heck it is all the way up there I'm gonna take a quick look and see if there's anything else here now see is just desert around these structures they are mostly ignoring these for now and if I go back to my ship I wonder if there's a way for me to discover where this beam is coming from it's definitely pretty low perhaps on the solar system map we can try to discover more so here's the star I am there and then hmm would any of these sites even come staging area small hammer fight deposits II didn't come for posts even come is still trying to stem the tide here they're definitely deploying all around this star at the moment I don't really see any warping points to find the origin of this beam but you may have seen the pictures posted already some people will have maybe propped it down or or managed to to get close to it with with a lot of patience or something like that and it looks like the tree glyphs are definitely building something up around there now it could become a Dyson Sphere although that would be absolutely huge especially if I look at how far away the origin of this beam seems to be so that's maybe not in the cards but perhaps just a massive structure like a gateway who knows very very cool and look at the graphical effect here that looks really amazing very unique you don't have the trick live in icons so from the trailer but you have this strange shoe that does remind me of the abyss of course and we get man this Corona that is so so very cool very very nice so we get a head over there we've got a 40 czar as well triangular try yeah triangular trading tower so definitely aligned with with the trig Levine's and I have docking axes perhaps I'll go and take a quick look but I'll do so being careful let's warp it in a hundred and see if there's anything happening here but this seems to at the moment at least be the central system where the trick Levin supporters are con concentrating their efforts and they're succeeding very well I would say that we are a decently close to that second liminality and potential further escalation of whatever it is that the trillions are trying to do here this is really cool you've gotta figure it out for yourself this is actually a lot of people nothing in range no and whoo something else again or is that the same can I get a view on its he's warping off or if I could snipe it we could have tried that maybe at some point but that try cleaving transport seems to be going or doing arounds around these structures and their forties are here that's actually repairing so it was attacked as well showing that there has definitely been quite a bit of conflict around here I seem to be doing okay let's hope that the claw is not heading straight for me now he's staying tethered so that's fine let's take a quick look at that Road Eva what's happening over here that one is actually just docking if you want like the PvP games and things like that right now I'm neutral I know that the true greatness will attack me but you see that you can get in here in a stealth bomber and from time to time you will undoubtably witness fights perhaps find people to attack as well if that's your goal there that's definitely a possibility help the trickiness disrupt them whatever you can do you can choose a side and try to influence what happens here in many ways structure wise there's a lot coming in this is still probably one of the most powerful mechanics in EVE Online of course plunk down a structure so that you have a base of operation somewhere to to tether to and that's not easily removed not without a significant amount of effort but this is very very cool the atmosphere here is kinda crazy I am really curious as to what's gonna happen and what else could I do to try and get on that beam well there was really nothing aligned with the reverse star planet one is the closest planet we could maybe do like a warp adeana under - on planet one and see what kind of view we get from there but yeah I can't get to that building sites for the trick Le'Veon for the trillions and see exactly what's happening there without a little bit more effort and preparation unfortunately we got a look at that transport ship so that was already very cool yeah this is definitely still very far away with any of these but all of those are like flashpoint deployments we're not seeing anything that would indicate and if I get even closer what do we have here Observatory flash points goddamn it's even hard stellar fleet deployment sites and this one another Observatory flashpoints hmm well I'll try one of these first again work within hundreds we see potential in UK or not you may prove your worth in joining the flow of rush otherwise of course we'll get extirpated for now we're still neutral and I'm still gonna just keep an eye on what the hell happens so there's the beam we definitely should wait past it it could be here so let's hope that I don't the cloak I don't then we'll do that one at a hundred let's see what's over there but I think it overshoots it by quite a lot it could be this that's just a minor conduits definitely something to keep I mean it looks like it could be aligned with that so let's see what's happening here and it has no that's just mmm okay so I can see the star there's the beam and now it's heading God knows where honestly the only thing that that seems like it could be in the right direction would be this structure here so I'm gonna do a warp patina under that that's alright so not being very succesful I also personally don't have too much interest in making a lot of enemies here I really don't know how any of this is going to play out and personally I'm still hoping for the ability to have industrial / mining activities become a part of the equation so that you do you're not forced basically into going after players or to just destroying stuff but you can also try to help them all out OOP and there's a trick live Ian's fleet waiting here with that one again nothing too close let's go take another look it does it look exactly the same yeah and this time it's it's observing so this is the new trick Lavigne Industrial ship very if we could somehow start to build that that would be very nice as well that's regular hole looking from the icon all of these are stuff that we know already all right well there you go guys this is going to be a look at the phase one should live in escalation I'm gonna continue to explore this without choosing a side right away I'll keep you guys up to date as all as always and for now thank you very much for watching and I'll see you all next time
