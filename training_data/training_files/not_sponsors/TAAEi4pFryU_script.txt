these Angie's of super satisfied hey guys and welcome to today's video in this one it's actually kind of close to an idea we've already done but instead of a 2v2 it's gonna be a 1v1 link and i are not on the same team this time it is bosses only and of course we're always gonna switch it up because that's what we like to do here so instead of a timed bosses only it is now 50 maximum kills and you can only kill a maximum of 10 bosses per boss if that makes sense so you can't kill more than 10 more cat but you could kill 3 if you want so no more than 50 kills no more than 10 kills per boss and when I use the term boss they have to be like actual bosses so raids doesn't count that's many bosses and a final boss Theatre of blood does not count barrows does not count but something like god where's dungeon does count so I hope that makes sense you guys will watch the video you'll definitely make sense of it as it progresses we can use tools from the bank but every other material has to be gotten we can use the Tanner if we get the coins so let me stop rambling we have 50 kills 10 kills max per boss and kill as many bosses as sponsoring today's video hey guys welcome welcome to the episode so here we are we have 50 boss kills and total skilling bosses are allowed and as you can see I am starting off with Sal Kano now of course when it comes to bossing there's so many things that you could potentially get or not get because bossing you know with only 10 kills max per boss you might not get the item you're looking for the great thing however about volcano is that it drops ores bars and runes very commonly that's pretty much the entirety of its drop table so no matter what I get I could use these materials because we can use tools from the bank so I can use these materials to just fill in the gaps of any other item sets or other items that I don't get throughout the progression of my boss kill so I'm just gonna send ten volcano kills because I know it's gonna be extremely useful for whatever setup I go for by the end of this challenge and let's hope we get rune Brunei or rune ID bars things like that is what we need so let's start sending some sake no kills and hopefully we get decently lucky literally our first drop our first drop is rune eye or 1 out of 50 or 1 out of 10 that I can do as allocatable 1 out of 50 in total and it's already looking pretty good ok so we're coming up on our 7th kill now we got some addy or some mithril or but we really need that coal thankfully a lot of bosses dropped coal so if I don't get the coal it's not the worst thing in the world steel bars I don't really think that's useful at all a lot of them they could be used to fill in any gaps if I don't get any coal but I find that pretty hard to believe with all the bosses I kill but it would be nice to get some rune eye bar secured by the end of xylocaine oh but we only have three kills left here and then we have to move on hello bees and geez welcome back to another PvP video today we've got some bosses to kill I'm back in my favorite place the wilderness you guys know how much fun I have when I go here I'm gonna go ahead and try and kill the crazy archaeologist the reason for this is because he does drop that rune crossbow and if we could secure that in our first boss kills then I could go ahead and try and make myself some room bolts and it's pretty easy to get ourselves some black d hide together as well so yeah we're gonna go ahead and send this and hopefully get ourselves a rune crossbow and amulet of power would be really nice even a red di body wouldn't be too bad and it means that I could probably just skimp out on not making a black D hi buddy and give me some extra kills somewhere else also drops prayer potions and food as well so that would be nice for the final fight but we'll see ten kills at the crazy arc I mean I don't have to do all of them if I get everything I want before that I can just do like four kills at the crazy arc okay here we go I've never done a crazy arc in gear like this so this should be pretty mental to be honest yeah this is crazy first kill coming in there and we are gonna get ourselves wolf weed yeah no thank you [ __ ] for [ __ ] sake Oh Liam chard - is what we get for our second drop 1.4 mil 1.4 mil third kills a [ __ ] long bone what the odium shard - is a one in two five six and the long bone is a one in 64 okay that's a lot less rather than I thought it was gonna be long bones everywhere else are like 1 in 400 what the [ __ ] oooh a hundred and three blood runes maybe if we're going magic who knows i think d hide my tea pretty easy to get we can't actually get d hidin less we get the coins for the tanner as well so we need a coin drop which is you know not the most common thing from Auster's usually you probably get it from rio drop table but you know d hide is very very high possibility in these challenges so magic is always always iffy it's always iffy the last kill this is kill number ten we need that coal ore already know what we got out of a night bar okay i mean i think i would have rather dull but at least now i don't need any coal for these out of yours because 13 is probably enough for anything so yeah there's 10 kills at zola keno here's everything we have down here I'm keeping track of all Lou of course in my loot tracker on rune light so yeah on to the next boss I'm thinking Zora we can get food the manta rays we could also get more a debars we can get some dragon Hallie's dragon met Helms any other unique drops and also coal it drops coal we need coal for those three Brunei orders that we have down there so let's do it our first kill we get manta rays that was the one thing I really wanted I was actually planning on getting the manta rays originally and then leaving the moment I get them but we still have the coal problem and I think just giving up those three rune I bars would be kinda silly so the chance of getting a cold drop is 1 out of 31 and wow that's a horror much he's like it makes snake skin armor now actually I can't isolate the coins but the chests life getting a cold drop is 1 out of 31 right you get two drops per kill though so technically one at a 15 point 5 we have it 8 kills to go but I'm gonna stick through it just because there's a lot of other stuff we can get like the D MIDI Holly something like a serpentine helm I don't think anything like a tanzanite Fang would really be applicable considering I need to get the darts the scales we have ready but dart to be quite annoying to get and everything but who knows then we could probably base our whole stratum that if we get the tanzanite Fang you know that's what I love about these PvP challenges they're changing by the second they always change by the second the next kill the next kill we get coal and we get 200 of it 200 coal and that's it was all our guys that it was Dolores there were only 13 kills in in total that was three silver kills I'm pretty hyped we got exactly what we wanted we got our food and the coal in literally three solar kills oh we got three potato and cheeses so that is some food upgrades for the final fight which is nice and then a shark it's for food upgrades okay that's actually a really good drop the coin drop because to actually use the tannery which we're going to be using because I will kill Volkov for Dee hide you need money to pay the shop and it's the only shot me in kins allow and he he tans you hide so you can actually make them in 2d height and without money I wouldn't have been able to do that and I was planning on getting some money later on in the challenge but now I don't even need to bother doing that which is nice so this is gonna be the last kill that should be it come on rune crossbow that's not what I wanted to see it's really not what I wanted to see it's about the same rarity might even be slightly rarer than the rune crossbow there we go guys good trip if I was trying to make money not the best of trips for what I'm trying to do in the PvP challenge right now bit of food which is nice we get the three potato cheese and the shark which does help towards the final fight but uh the rest of the stuff really not gonna help okay next up is gonna be broadcast the reason for that is he has a drop that sends me either magic melee or ranged doesn't really matter what gets dropped so I just want to be put in a direction I like it when when we do a boss and I'm literally just told go ahead and do this so that is exactly what we're gonna do here and I'm gonna get done straightaway Wow [ __ ] I can't remember if you probably range your [ __ ] mage now I think it's made I need to drink that as well this is why you record your clips before you go and kill the boss link because you cannot multitask here we go beautiful turn the right off and we're away nice Volkov can send us in any direction on the combat triangle and I'm more than happy to go down any of them depending on what the best thing is so what I'm going to do 10 kills here see what we get first kill super slow I could not hit o-ring kite shield and magic logs has turned this off magic logs Amran coach it was [ __ ] hell so we could make an MSB if I get flax from Zora for example met we could go ahead and make an SB we got some blue dragon hide not too bothered about that right now I think we will get hopefully some other dragon hide problem is if we do go down the MSB route we can't use a rune kite shield so we'll continue these kills and see what we get be happier could not be happier we are now going to send vork cath and test our luck there because you can get things like room kites the dragon plate legs dragon plate skirt we can get all bunch of D highs in case we get any coin drops I think he also drops coins so it's just of course an all-around great boss so let's hit up our boy vork hath won our second kill we get dragon stones I mean I don't think I'm gonna go for it the glory I don't think I'm to go for the glory but hey if we get like you know gold or drop somewhere could be worth thinking about but I'm not gonna change my plan for a glory though be a bit excessive but it's on the list of things that might happen I will say that just got more mantarays no I mean of course they're a great thing to get but I already got them you know I already got them yeah that is uh three kills of work cast you have seven more in total that we could potentially kill ooh beautiful beautiful beautiful we get a room kite thankfully we got something with five kills in now hoping got at least one more decent item from forecast but if not I'm not too stressed we did get the room kite which is gonna be beautiful for the final fight probably one of the best in slots you realistically could get with the amount of kills we have so awesome love to see it interesting interesting just got a battle staff drop so I guess magic would be a lot more viable now we also have like 500 death rooms around 900 chaos runes about a hundred blood rooms from sake no problem with magic is just it's so easy to negate he'll at least have blue dragon hide if he gets a coin and you know vork ass drops every hide there is just like these noted blue dragon hides it drops noted in every single form so I don't think magic will be that applicable truthfully table number two coming in and we get dragon bolt some finished of course we do and a wrath talisman that is [ __ ] horrendous let's kill number three oh my god and manta rays that's [ __ ] disgusting so we have full it we have a full Emma tree of manta rays now a dragon battle axe and a room kite shield wow wow wow wow that's ulis okay we go Mel a quite obviously that's [ __ ] nuts I'm now gonna go and kill the king black a dragon with a twisted bow and I am [ __ ] myself I know I'm not gonna lose it but I'm just worried you know I'm just worried bees are jeez so I'm actually gonna turn off my player attack probably should have done that before but being in the wilderness with a tea boat feels incredibly incredibly wrong but we are here and we're gonna go kill the King back dragon jumped out a broadcast after three kills didn't really feel like I needed to kill it anymore so that's the reason we did that and let's see are we gonna get free world we're on a 2k world yeah looks like we are beautiful let's drink that lets drink that and the reason I am here is because we want the black dragon hide I'm gonna make a black D Heidi and that's the reason that I've gone for that so yeah he also drops like a D bars room bars things like that which could be helpful I mean we could still get rune eyed bars through night limbs from the KBD so we could still go down the the range route if I wanted to see where my first drop is and look power though we'll have it we all have it that is exactly what I wanted to see as well I forgot to mention it but yeah absolutely beautiful and he is already spawned [ __ ] and me as you can tell I don't do much king black dragon 4857 kills and I don't think I've ever killed it really on any other account so yeah this is pretty much my full experience with the KBD second kill is gonna be some sharks but we already have the manta ray so it doesn't really matter about that we've got 42 manta rays or whatever it was so yeah we're absolutely fine for food but I guess it means I can extend this trip a bit which is nice and that might be why I've been told to bring so many of these with me oh you drained your stats as well doesn't he he's a little [ __ ] I'm getting absolutely annihilated here this doesn't feel right it doesn't feel right at all but to be fair we are annoying in back which is nice we also got enough black 3d hide now as well rune longsword and no thank you we've got enough black d hide now as well to be able to make the the black D hide top as well and we got those coins earlier from the crazy Ark so the crazy Ark wasn't a toe to waste of time cuz the coins were really nice means we can use the Tanner to go ahead and make a black D hide body and some BAM braces now as well actually I think I've got a focus going down the Mele route now to be honest we've got the amulet power we're gonna have the black D hi body with the vams which would be really nice for defense and obviously with the rune kite and the dragon battle axe already I just don't think it's worth pursuing that range route so Mele is gonna be the way now gonna try and get myself some room plate legs from somewhere we have the tenth killer coming up guys kill number ten what do we get a Renard seed dammit I was really hoping for like a dragon longsword or dragon battle axe but you know it is what it is we did get a root longsword but I mean I could make a rune scim II with the bars that I've got with the bars that I could make from volcano and Zalora so kind of useless because I definitely prioritize weapon over you know over armor but with that said that has vork hath done if we did get the room kite is that your second drop we do have a room kite and we do have some blue D high that we can make but also just thinking about it we could also go to kbd get one kill or actually probably need two kills it really depends on how much black dragon high we want to make but I want to send some God Wars dungeon now get some coin drops so we can make black dragon hide and just maybe get lucky there's a lot of bosses that drop just rune equipment adding equipment things like that to fill in some slots plus you can hit the drop table and get something crazy like a Sammy sphere right guys here we are at krill now krill drops things like rune scimitar a deeply body room plate lakes dragon dagger P plus plus you can get things like super sets or actually the super attack and super strength which I think are drop together super stores death runes blood rooms there's a lot of options we can get from Sammy Sammy also drops the same rockin spear which is an amazing weapon and it's only one out of 127 of course we'd have to get lucky to get that but it's possible to get which is the exciting part I will also be doing the boss so whether I get the drop or not I'm gonna count it as my kill just so it's constant going with every duo that we do I got worse so whether it's my drop or not 10 kills going in Sammy first and depending on the drops he might hit up Sarah after cuz Sarah also has some pretty exciting drops that we could potentially get so without further ado let's go and kill some Zam rock we were a third kill heed we get an adamant plate body yes boys not the best thing we could have gotten but of course gonna take anything I can get as we're doing this so we have seven more kills to go okay guys I'm going for the win here I really am I have never done crille solo I've only killed krill maybe four or five times other than that when I've been with like other people so I really dunno what the [ __ ] I'm doing here but he does drop a room plate legs drop quite commonly he also drops and what's it called a lot of like pots super strength super attack super defense things like that so I sort of have to do it you know has to be done so oh [ __ ] I thought I could put that on [ __ ] no prayer as well I'm not going to be able to commentate over this guys I'm going to be concentrating so yeah enjoy whatever you hear I don't know what you're gonna hear I really don't I think I need to do this always right click and we will see what happens say I don't want to die either that would be very annoying oh god this doesn't feel it doesn't feel good I'll tell you that it's turn auto retaliate off our dragon Warhammer spec that would probably be a great idea wouldn't it oh we've hit nice I think you're only meant to put one in this man's try and talk to me rebo I'd love to reply to you mate but I am [ __ ] myself too much I don't want to die so yes correct and those who shout out in the and the pupae challenge come on oh my god wow that was just [ __ ] brutal kill kill kill kill kill please yes there we go my first ever solo krill and it's gonna be GP and the next kill guys we get a coin drop 19 K so that's gonna be the Tanner sorted like I said we could probably have the KBT get Blackie height super easy so that's black D height for us let's pick up that coins before that [ __ ] disappears because knowing my luck it probably would but there we go awesome that's pretty much black D hide sorted and we still have six kills to go here that is we did not just get a rude civet RA I mean it's not the best weapon by any means but at least you know we don't have to use those three room bars that we could make into a rune scimitar and that have one left over and now we can just use three bars to make gear because we have the best rune equipment here and fortunately it's not a spear or the dragon dagger P plus plus but I I'm definitely happy I did get it in the long run at least but hopefully we can upgrade that at some point today but but right now I am glad I had it this is a nice like mid to your weapon again at least so we have let's see three more kills to go and maybe we can still pull off that same rockin spear or something let's see let's see what are we gonna get room plate legs hahaha that is [ __ ] sick dude I am heights Mikey sauce yes dude that is that's awesome that's [ __ ] awesome right I'm just gonna tell you I'm not even gonna [ __ ] bother killing those [ __ ] Wow dude yes yes yes yes so not bad not bad from zamorak I'll take it I'll definitely if I can take it so the next boss we have is the chaos elemental guys now of course when you kill bosses it's like risk versus reward you could risk the few kills the ten kills and getting a like a big-ticket item the chaos deli is the opposite of that it has a lot of really useful drops like super sets super tacks drink defense which are all one out of ten it drops a dragon dagger 1 out of 11 and it drops weapon poison plus plus one out of 10 I believe ruin did I just hit rare drop table I did not just hit very drops are you combine they're not the rare drop I want but yeah it's not even to be a fun yeah it's gonna be big a with an e like I'm half-assing it [ __ ] end him ended I was only one hit but I'm [ __ ] myself but there we go there's the kill we got the kill what do we get adamant play buddy No no no no no no no no okay we are reverting this trying not to die [ __ ] it let's just break it and go to trial I'm too stressful far too stressful for me tell you that you know what it's like a 1 in 30 ish chance to either get the dragon plate legs or dragon plate skirt from Volkov so it makes sense to go and do the seven kills I didn't do it walk half now to see if we can snag those because obviously they're an upgrade and they're not actually that much rarer to get then killing krill for the room plate legs so I'm gonna do that okay so we are at Volkov realized that last time I didn't wear my eaj so I'm sure loads of comments are gonna call me a [ __ ] idiot for that also forgot to charge this so we're waiting for that to charge until I get a bit more what's it called a bit more defense and whatever it does I think out she starts working as well then as well it used to be able to walk walk or rooks walk whatever you want to call it and can't anymore so yeah you're enjoying me doing this which looks absolutely atrocious we will go in for it now though what the [ __ ] is going on that is a 1 in 8,000 108 I'm genuinely flower girl I've never had a shield left hard drop on any account ever I am flabbergasted by that you [ __ ] a beautiful dragon you legend legend yes kill number eight of the total everything going on we've killed eight Warcraft now yes we get ourselves the dragon plate skirt kins for those who don't know rogues name is rock because of the dragon battle ax spec and he loves plate skirts so I'm gonna turn up in [ __ ] he loves I'm so happy so happy second kill coin drop so I guess maybe we'd even have to go to guard or asunción but then again I think we did have the hook-up from zami so still no stress but cool I mean we saw a black D hide on the agenda though that's gonna be your last thing we kill as the KBD tell me a better drop tell me a better drop guys that's the save kill that is the same kill now pretty happy because now forget the weapon poison on/off the poison my freaking spear over here the super defense is pretty hype as well we're definitely to bring that in the fight I would say that you know especially that we can repot during the fight it's definitely worth the manta ray I'm sure it'll block 22 damage at least so that's pretty cool there but yeah only three kills in and things are looking up so last kill super attack and antidote I mean I want the weapon poison not the antidote and of course it's not worth bringing an antidote if he's not poisoning but there's no way to tell if he's poisoning or not I don't think I'll bring it to be honest I might take the risk but I'm gonna decide that after the fact after I have my final gear setup especially if I have pots to bring that's gonna be a lot of pots if I also bring an antidote as well and you know that's where issues start to arise when you're just sacrificing so much food for pots and that's actually my third death room drop ones bank but I have 375 death rooms from this [ __ ] and three kills to go still want to try to get that weapon poison and maybe a super strength in the process as well the ninth kill oh boy it's like I don't know if this is too good to be true or what I don't know what to think right now but I am happy so I do know that I'm a very happy boy right now there is the weapon poison the only thing that we didn't get so far we solved one kill left is the super-strength pot so we are just going to send in one last kill here maybe we'll get it maybe we won't last kill chaos elemental we just telling me away and the worst drop so far which I'm okay with knows no super-strength but that's totally fine that's totally fine we got everything else we wanted next up we're gonna kill the kbd so we have seven kills left we killed five monsters in total but of course we only kill threes Alaura so that leaves us with seven more monsters we can possibly kill the KBD we need at least two kills to make a black D high body and black beehive and braces which is what I'm definitely to bring to the fight the black D hide body pretty much is the same stats we should say very similar stats to a D but you get the magic defense as well and of course just a vambrace let's fill up the slot that will leave us with five kills but looking at the drop table we could definitely still get things like a power me a roo night bar a dragon med helm so it's things that we could potentially bring to the final fight as well I'm just going to help him kill this real quick cuz that was annoying yes hello and I'm gonna hop you didn't think I wasn't gonna send Zell row did you my favorite boss you guys have seen me do this enough I know you have so I'm only gonna report if I get and to be honest only here for a specific drop two drops our guest dragon med helm or cert busy we can use any tools we want in the bank so I can turn a surface into a helm use the scales that I get from Zara to make it usable so sir power drag a med helm to try and fill that helm slot chance of it happening pretty low drag a med helm isn't too difficult to get but I have been here for a very long time previously so we will see how that goes I didn't even put up nice one but yeah just got to rune eye tours and we also got some snake skin as well so I can make some snakeskin boots the rune eye or I guess I could go for some coal and get a room full helm if we don't get the the SERP or the med helm so I guess yeah that's not too bad coal I don't think would be too hard to come by we could actually get it here at Zara so it definitely will be sending all ten anyway so we might get the coal here and then we'll just be able to make a route for helm which would be nice so three full helm or three helm options now from Zara we just got it the car so we have a room full help sort it out I am gonna do the last four kills just to try and see if we can get the other med help or not or the the cert IV ously unlikely but to be honest guys I've done so well in every slot that it's gonna be hard to find I'm gonna have to try and go for a weapon I think because the dragon battle axe is probably one of the poorest things I've got it's a great weapon but it's six speed is the issue so it's a slow weapon so yeah we're gonna have to look into that and try not great I think we might be doing some solo commanders in the honor the [ __ ] is y r-d today you guys are gonna hate me you guys gonna hate me I'm so sorry kins the problem is maybe he's got a weapon and it just sends me home dragged a bed helped on the account its Wow okay so the the coal of the Roo die or is pretty pointless now I don't really know what I could make with that because everything else I've got is already better than that this is mental this is absolutely mental okay so we're gonna send somes ileana to try and get a saradomin sword because that would be mad okay we have had one before in a PvP challenge so possibly possibly it will happen again let's hop in and let's do this and to be fair I've actually done a decent amount as ileana I mean not like a crazy amount he says as he still is zamorak [ __ ] robe brilliant not like a crazy amount of solo Sarah but like I've done enough to not be flustered and I know what I need to do sort of thing so yeah we were in an all right spot here I'm not gonna get absolutely destroyed my ship yeah to get I think I think I've done like a twenty trip before so yeah we should be able to get a decent amount of kills here without anything going to wrong yes guys third kill in so we technically like do we even kill the kbd anymore we could get the met no it [ __ ] it we're gonna finish our last few kills at Zora just because we have a total of let's see four kills to get now guys because that was only three king black dragon kills wow they got the power a me [ __ ] yeah I just figure there's a higher chance of getting a D met there plus we could probably get a chance a chance at like a tanzanite thing or a serpentine helm well I guess the tanzanite thinning I can't do much with because I don't have any darts let's just send the last four Zorba kills and then that's gonna be the episode funny enough guys we get a room bar and the thing is is actually don't even really need these anymore because I have what I need to make a room full helm that was the only slot I was really missing in this challenge so far so technically that's kinda useless it's kind of useless unless I save up for like a room plate or something but I still think I need one more room bar for that and I doubt I'll get another from zilara so looking like that won't do much for us but you know if a room bar doesn't do much that means we're in a pretty good spot in terms of our loot and gear for the for the final fight why so first first they get a room spear then I get two magic seeds right I'm like my orangey is is so messed up in like in like the most backwards kind of way what alrighty then can't say that's ever happened in 1.5 K kills I think that's kill number two yep went down a lot lot lot nicer than the first one we'd actually hit with the we hit with the what's it called Tibo which is nice 99 Lauren's so yeah really not too great we got ourselves a super defense unreal so we got four dos oh my god [ __ ] hell I'm so busy on the drop so but even looking at what's going on here so we got ourselves a full pot of super defense which is awesome magic potion obviously gonna be totally useless but that is absolutely naughty love it absolutely love it there we go that is ten zillion is done no Lou other than the super defenses so I guess that wasn't too bad at all but yeah obviously didn't get the sorrow sword which would have been ridiculous I mean let's be honest the orange e's been too good already so no complaints there okay the last one is gonna be the chaos le that we are going to be killing because he drops a dragon dagger fairly commonly fairly commonly drops our dragon dagger there was a guy here he's going for it he's got the crossbow who's gonna get the kill probably him maybe me actually I got a little head start which was nice I think he's gonna get it she's a very annoying hit over 33 I could win it for me come on I need the hit I need the hit he's gonna get that in a yeah [ __ ] sake there we go what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] I don't think that's better I don't I don't think that's better than rune kite shield dragon battle-ax I don't even know oh my what has been the ROG today it's been nuts it has been absolutely nuts so we got nothing else at the chaos alley unfortunately didn't get the dragon dagger so this is the setup I'm pretty happy the black D hide came from the KVD and then we use the money that we got from Zilly Anna krill etc etc to use the Tanner and then we had tools provided so I made them into the body and the van braces then same thing with the snakeskin boots as well that obviously the dragon plate skirt from war calf the new dragon dead helm from Zara the dragon battle axes from Volkov and the rune card shoot from there as well and then of course got the amulet power from KVD super defense from commanders Lilliana and then all of the mantas which I actually got from Zara and walk out the ended up would like nearly a hundred of those so that was pretty crazy stats are looking beautiful they are looking so so nice and I think this dragon battle axe I don't know if I'll use the spec or not just to show you what it does it increases our strength to 118 but it puts the defense down but then I could repot giving me full defense back because I'm probably not gonna use a whole defense part in a fight anyway which just means that I'd be down on attack so I don't know whether I'm gonna spec on up we will see how well I'm hitting against him and I'll probably decide mid fight but the defense part is really gonna help with that I'd be very surprised if he's done better than this even if he's going magic I've got a plus 59 magic defense I can't see him beating it I really can't unless he got some mad ROG mad mad RG then yeah fair enough but in terms of like just getting baseline good stuff this is let's see if we can be in last kill of the episode and we get to worstell's so let's head back to Edgeville make the stuff that we have all the bars and you know make the dagger all that fun stuff and I'll show you guys my final gear setup so guys real quick just comparing some gear I only have four addy bars to work with so my options are breaking a deep lay body that I got us a drop then bring a room full helm and use two of the ROO night bars and four stab slash and crush 202 203 188 but if I instead use the four bars to make of rune med helm and a rune chain body it's only 192 slash is the same crush is actually much higher but I think crush is the least likely weapon that he's gonna use on us so unfortunately we can't do this setup we only have four bars that I'm so angry about it so it's looking like we're gonna have to go with the addy play buddy in the room full helm and just take our losses with the other two rue knight bars right guys I'm making the executive decision to not bring the black di body I know that sounds a bit wack but hear me out I I think black D hide is so viable but I don't think he's gonna risk combing magic but even if he did if you take a look here we still have a plus 15 magic defense that when I take off my armor I don't think he's gonna hybrid me so if he goes magic this is just what I'll be fighting in and just take off everything else we're bringing the super defense and the super attack of course we poison the dagger as well and yes I am gonna bring both of rune scimitar and a dragon dagger dragon dagger specs and can poison but the ruined semi is actually you know you get an extra plus 5 slash over the stab so the rune scimitar actually has higher attack bonuses there are different styles but it's 51 slash verses 46 stab and I don't know it just based on how close some of these PvP challenges are that could definitely be the difference also with the rune scimitar we get an extra max hit 50 strength versus 46 so man it's it's always crazy with all this stuff in the best way to go about doing it but there's of course no way to tell which is the best way without knowing link setup of course if he's weak to stab this it would be best to have and just save the manta ray but yeah so this is gonna be the final fight guys and I will see you there for the reveal linkie my man what is up dude how did you find 50 bosses ah took a long time look a lie how long did it take you I think about five hours really it took me about three and a half so I don't know yeah I don't want to go through her bad thing that it's taking you so long I saved my R and she was pretty godly and that was why it took so long Oh God like a huge item like a what the [ __ ] that's gonna win on its own like I don't have a game changing like that but I just feel like I did really well pretty much everywhere I have a strange feeling I know where you're going with this but Ryan let's just fire into the into the reveal and see what happens so link you can pick the first item and we will cling on into it I was so relaxed before now I have anxiety great so much my shield RJ was [ __ ] up unfortunately the two [ __ ] up shield are Angie's I can actually use so okay she will first mate and wait what you got shields that you can't use I got parts of shield so I got an OD insured yeah and I also got a left half shield Wow from my boss one in 8,000 or so Wow yeah now I know my guys going for a room crossbow and over on how happy he sounds fit nervous he got it you know black t hide wasn't that hard to get but you said shield slot so let me pop that on yeah all right yep oh yeah I also got shield and where'd you get that forecast right same that's where I also got my shield left half frog that is so funny dude I just don't have ever got it never really yeah so that was that was good fun Wow alright I'm gonna go with gloves okay I think this is pretty standard yeah yeah okay yeah I mean whether you go in range or not that's pretty yeah okay amulet kins I actually have one this time I don't you don't have an amulet but I have an amulet power me take well I'm gonna say you got yours from the arc No Wow I got mine from KVD [ __ ] sake let me guess what different D hides yeah sure is do we go but I went with my a deeply body instead I took a huge gamble that you weren't going magic because this gives much higher slash defense I'm very glad to know because if you had any sort of magic I mean I guess he could still be going magic but yeah buzzy say the negatives on this is just horrible wow that's this Brea kid paid off a little bit there okay all right I feel I feel a little bit better now but I still think you ever in crossbow so whose turn is it it is well we just threw on the bodies I think but you said inlet so I'm so I think it's me next okay I'll go helm co-op Eve this Oh God it's a caddy med isn't it or something yeah dude Laura get this orangey not fakely a room full help actually isn't that much worse but still you know the fact he's got the slight edge Audrey I made this yeah I made this oh yeah don't be very nice a dress and come oh right dude I actually started my Nets okay know this really yeah I got three rune eye or and how'd it get cool elsewhere which I did end up getting at a Zara after the fact it not games Arcana right Nora sorting us out with the cult yeah but and that's why that's where I made the helm with so yep uh will go blank skins now here's where it could really bury for you because is he going D hide legs Wow I hope he goes D hard legs makes you get the rune plates from I got this oh I filmed this yesterday where'd I get this from well now I seem like the biggest idiot in the world [ __ ] all right I'm looking back in the footage don't roast me chat like you got it as a drop yeah I got a job somewhere play oh yes uh sorry I got it from zamorak I went to crow yeah I went I went to krill I I'd never killed it before other than like for a joke and I went low and it was horrible he got two kills laws like that really so yeah I work now that I'm it what was it like a 1 in 24 1 8 for the room plates from krill oh yeah like one in 15 1 in 20 or something like um we're up yeah and I was like whoa cough drops both plate legs and skirt what is 75 so that's like a 1 in 30 ish somewhere chance he didn't love it there he did not get it paid off not enjoyed crow it paid off yeah but you know what that hurts because I've killed 10 more calf I killed 10 crew yeah look alright just put on the crossbow like there's no way you'd be this happy if you didn't get your crossbow just put it on I didn't get the crossbow you didn't get the crossbow I didn't get the Cross firkins so you tell me what the cosmo do not [ __ ] you with me here are you know I would just try okay I'm just a weapon see you won't throw on everything else that yeah you made some snakeskin boots from solar as well that's that's it wow I just missed out that went over my head I could have done Wow use then I mean the thing is that's still a good play body it's magic defense you could be going melee arrange right now and I have no idea what do I want you to go I guess I want you to have knives this depends what kind of knives but I the higher slash defense minister - yeah you're fairly thank you on you oh right so you're just a weapon now correct kins what do you got back what have you got Oh have you got quad come on Khan come on got it from curl yeah so long Crowe back I saw a girl back to back yep yep it's not in the record but I did get it back to back I just show the faster one raisi okay so it could have been a lot worse I tried I did solo commanders ileana mate Oh No if you got a Sarah sword what about the the ACB mate y-yeah that's out a worried about her Road Crossy no surely not it's like 1 5 12 I would be like I did go do solo I did do it I did it my guys playing the biggest mind games he's ever and I'm not sure why and I was so happy to see a play Bunny come out so happy for the crush so I actually had two leftover room bars but right I couldn't have anything to make and I was doing different tests like oh I could do a a rune Med helm and a rune chain body and I was like ah like crushes is the most uncommon one isn't that / though I know it has crush so there's a v difference I actually looked at this before I even because I thought you might you might go play Pawnee there's a v difference between its slash and crush but obviously the play buddy's so much weaker eyes got a DDS [ __ ] what they called [ __ ] care Sally oh yeah drop the dagger in the poison so yeah yeah what the carousel he [ __ ] dropped me night what's a dragon [ __ ] th are you serious I think there was something else as well what the [ __ ] dude that's so annoying honestly Wow I like do you have I ever even taken a battle axe you a fight before of the dragon variety I don't even think so it's like in rargh man I got the job and I was like and you love having your knees out I'm literally turning up in your like your wet dream of a reveal legit dude like what you have right there took like five years to get back in 2005 and my man did in five hours wait I didn't even do tankers at volk a third is 8 Wow and this is why it took so long I got so much good stuff in had to do so many different bosses so he got the food too then so I decided a few most graceful so well one Citroen scimitar I was doing a lot of like second guessing with this a rune semi non spec is better DPS than a dragon dagger so I just bit the bullet and hoped you were kind of weak to slash instead of jab yeah and then this case of the mentor I can match you with one okay King dilly I've got this is what I do have a saving grace is obviously the dragon battle I expect gives me like a strength but super strength and then back up to full so but I'm not gonna do that until I'm sure if I can hit you well enough a lot because I do lose nine attack level so I gotta play around with it man you know now link just do you want to tell me for your weak to stand for slash what do you think I'm wait - I think you're weak - stabbed by very slightly hold enjoy hold on I'm gonna pound the body really doing some investigating cheeky [ __ ] oh I'd see uh I'm gonna guess you're weak to slash man just gonna take a guess I see VA to take out exact year so or just kid of send it [Music] and before we hop in the fight though guys first we'll talk about links episode real quick that went live the exact same time that this one went live the premise of his upload is we basically have these tasks easy medium hard that we complete where we get points and the fastest person to complete that gets even more points and those points translate to better gear I'm gonna keep it a bit vague because I want you guys to go check it out it's a new concept we think it's really cool we actually haven't even picked our gear yet with the spins that we have so we have no idea the outcome but we're both really excited to get into it but first we have this fight and we have the Dragon Warrior versus the free-to-play noob well I'm on the semi first the the free-to-play legit I'm all free

gonna be accurate but not that accurate come on he's poisoned okay he's lost [ __ ] speck on it you hit zero but it's still poison me really I didn't know you don't even happened yeah because the zero still counts as a potential hit oh look you could hit a zero right yeah yeah you can roll a zero up who decides your hitting and can you got it on that [ __ ] Wow no I'm fuming I hit and it was a zero bro okay come on big hit did you start off strong but now that you're not hitting I feel a little bit better but that was a train wreck he just did and come on okay all right all right that with the

he's not he's not reposing oh yeah [ __ ] see that's what I'm scared about just hit that [ __ ] again that [ __ ] 35 that was beautiful majestic I'm so infrequently here I know and you think is so
