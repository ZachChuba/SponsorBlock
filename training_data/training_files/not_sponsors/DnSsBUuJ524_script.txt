Day America so people were first off let's acknowledge the elephant in the room he misspelled feet FEG fe80 i am queen of typos I feel like the internet needs my opinion on all things right away I don't have time to withhold from them I need to get it out there as fast as possible so I am in no position to kind of make fun of anybody's typos but I think most people were supportive of what he said I don't want to act like he got ratioed or anything like that because I think most people are either just like okay liked it moved on maybe they like Trump or we're just kind of saying hey congrats on your recent win kind of thing I mean this one over strangely because Connor talks a lot and so I'm not even sure how much I care about this and to some degree because he just talks so much crap all the time to everybody that's something you can't really take it seriously a lot of the time and in the recent years basically he hasn't fought very much and he's been still talking a lot of game so it would be very easy to dismiss this but the fact is he does he tweeted this one what I believe was Monday Martin Luther King yeah and day right and just two nights prior as I'm sure most of you are aware he had a phenomenal fight a comeback fight against Donald cowboy Cerrone it was also a terrific like I love that you're looking at me for this if I have anything to up how would I describe it like you know if you're a southerner a southerner an American guy cowboy is like the icon of like what I think of those people like you know he's a good he's a good dude I like him a very good guy and a respectable athlete but he got he got crushed in 40 seconds by Konnor and it was a terrific fight are there spoilers in at UFC do we have to like disclaims that as one that works I don't know sorry but you if you if you haven't heard what happened and the point the point is I guess that after that happened you kind of had to start taking Connor seriously again so it's like people when he responded with this tweet and he's on the top of the mountain again of athletes everywhere now I'll sudden the left isn't very happy about it and have a lot more trouble dismissing that I guess than they would normally and I think it's also valid to say he doesn't need this right now like he just had this huge win everyone's talking about it it's not like he needed to drum up controversy or attention no and I mean historically he hasn't had a problem with that anyway again which we will get to but yeah most most people were supportive or didn't care but there were some people predictably saying Oh too bad I used to be a fan right right I have so I mean part of me is like yeah sure he'd be losing more fan because he has lost fans in the past because he has done some things that are less than I guess ideal I would say but so I'm not sure I was from a business move for him but I think that it was it was definitely interesting take yeah well I mean my views on celebrity politics if you're new here is that celebrity should be held to the same standard as everyone else when it comes to politics so they don't have to like keep quiet and never express their views and their views aren't worthless they're worth as much as anyone elses and I also don't think that they have to insert themselves into politics if they don't want to right I mean just like anyone else but I do believe their beliefs aren't correct because they're celebrities they shouldn't be made to be figureheads of certain causes they're not educated about just because they're celebrities and like anyone else if you don't shut up about politics while at work and your work does not relate to politics you're annoying okay people get bored of that that's a pretty general rule of thumb so if I see a celebrity whose work I like making a post now and then about like not liking Trump or voting Democrat which reviews I don't agree with like as long as they're not acting like a crazy person about it or trying to become like this full-time activist like as long as they're engaging in politics like a normal person would like your uncle or aunt on Facebook with an ID it doesn't bother me then so I kind of view this tweet by McGregor as something akin to that this seemed honestly very relatively classy you know you just said congratulations so he he he stated a political opinion and that was it it wasn't like from the MMA fans and and Formica people you might have seen on Candice Owens show she had a Kolby Covington who just fought for a title in November and he is like Mega Man he's like all the way like like the trumps fly out to watch him fight basically they they put him in the hotel and everything like that Connor didn't do something like that Connor said you know this is good just put out a tweet right exactly I don't find that I don't find it up noxious he also did it like quote quote reply so it's like on Twitter if you want to draw more attention to something you can post it on your own timeline or you can just reply on there so that's what he did he should apply it on his I think a lot of McGregor fans we're like all right I still like you for your athleticism it's not like I was coming to you for any sort of political discourse advice anyway this is fine but the no be honest is a certain percentage of his fans that I don't think it matters what he does they'll still be fans I have gotten the feeling of that yeah well cuz I mean before the McGregor fans or former fans who are saying that his support of Trump means they can't be as fans anymore like what they're essentially saying is that their support for an athlete kind of hinges on the athletes morality and there's ah in their eyes like they're saying you're too bad a person now I'm not gonna support you that's a fair point well I mean that's fair enough like there's the view that I just like you for your athleticism your skill or if you want to kind of say no I want to judge you as a person as a whole I'm not here to say one is better than the other but if that is your view that you can't support a fighter now because he's a bad person he's done bad things considering everything that McGregor has done how is him just saying that Donald Trump is the greatest of all time like that's what sends him over the edge into the realm of like not acceptable behavior like this is what he's done that source cuz we're gonna go through some of the things that he's done just for context because I know a lot of maybe some people watching this don't know here's an article that came out I think last year from the independent Conor McGregor Miami arrests the most controversial moments in the UFC stars professional career again we're not trying to hate on Conor here we're just doing this for context on Monday the mixed martial artist and one-time professional boxer was arrested in South Florida for stealing the cell phone of someone who is trying to take his photo authorities said but this is far from the first time the UFC superstar has seen his name in the news for all the wrong reasons below we take a look at some of the most controversial moments in an incredibly turbulent career here we go I own this town I own rio de janeiro mcgregor told brazilian fighter jose aldo sorry if that's not right in a series of heavily criticized comments and this is where it gets good in previous times i would invade his favela on horseback and would kill anyone who wasn't fit to work but we're in a new time so I'll whup his ass instead okay although this is said and done and then McGregor has become being in trouble for throwing things before ahead of UFC 202 he became involved in a heated education with the Diaz brothers which culminated in him hurling full cans of energy drink across a press conference he was subsequently fined 25k by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and handed 25 hours community service listen this is promotion she's promotion right there were a number of controversial moments during the Mayweather vs McGregor world press tour with the UFC champion accused of racism on more than one occasion he attracted criticism for telling me whether to dance for me big boy and if you're like oh that's actually not that bad not done before later reasoning he was not a racist because quote I'm black from the belly button down positive yeah a warrant for McGregor's arrest was issued after the Irishman was caught on video smashing the window of a bus full of Fighters with a sack trolley the two fighters were injured in the incident with mcgregor eventually handing himself in to the police he was eventually sentenced to three days of anger management courses and five days of community service and he was also banned from the UFC for six months and fined 50k for brawling with the camp of khabib after his world title loss and that list by the way doesn't include the video footage that came out in August of him punching an old man at a pub and also in fairness he's also got some allegations of sexual abuse yes in fairness but like I said if you if you still want to support him as an athlete and say I enjoy watching him yeah fight that's I'm not saying that's not valid but for anyone who's like now you're a bad person you know I was with you with those comments but you supporting Trump that's what makes you unacceptable I'm never gonna understand that they're buying into the Trump's Hitler kind of thing I'm not sure I don't I'm not sure the new logic to it well it's just they have an emotional connection to McGregor yeah an emotional hatred for Trump and then it's like well I guess one one has won over the other for them but there wasn't any logic behind there there yeah and it's like it just there are so many things like that especially in Hollywood in music and entertainment if you're a conservative in like a lot of these media rules you will be blacklisted for you know saying anything that's considered to right-wing but there are so many other celebrities who have done things like I mean Chris Brown beat the crap out of Rihanna what he was it in Woody Allen he's just like really weird dude roman polanski like there's so many of them and like somehow and we even saw this with vince vaughn a celebrity famous person kind of coming out with maybe even slightly right-wing I think Vince Vaughn is actually libertarian not even like conservative that's what gets news coverage I guess yeah that's what gets you morally indignant it's crazy what the heck is that a few people have suggested online that the people saying they're no longer fans of his were never actually fans of his to begin with and they're just kind of trying to make him regret what he said I actually I have had people do that to me online like I'll post something on social media it'll get shared and then someone will say oh I used to like you but you know this is awful like unsubscribed or unfollowed and then like I'll check out their profile and it's like based on what you're posting here you were never a fan just like really quick so yeah I mean I think there is maybe somewhat of an attempt to make him more worried that he's losing fans than he actually yeah I I think he's had way bigger fish to fish to fry in terms of losing fans in the past yeah like he's done some he's done some things that merited people not being a fan of his yeah you know what and I'm not I'm not someone on my fan boy for calling and believe it or not I I I enjoy watching him fight I think he's charismatic and I like like you know so to some degree I am a fan of it okay fine I'm getting progressively alright yeah I'm not like obviously his personality yeah outside outside of there I find reprehensible a lot of the time but then there's the other side of me that like I want I see someone who genuinely seems like this whole fight we he didn't talk any was been on very good behavior for quite a while he stopped drinking he's doing all these things to get his life back in order it's like well I'm a Christian and I'm biased and want to give this guy a second chance and to be fair I've done like even when if anybody knows who John Jones is he's a UFC light heavyweight champion who is like also King degenerate like like someone who ran into a pregnant woman's car broke her leg and then ran off like it looks like bad not good right but he seemed genuinely like he was trying to turn a new leaf at one point to me yeah despite everybody hating him and I was ready to try welcome yeah but then he did something bad again and I was a guard this is yeah it's just a good point like you know and for all the Conor McGregor apologists out there we should be willing to move on I think it's been like what nine months since is less controversy so yeah if he's on a better Road then that's all good but I mean some people were saying that anyone who supports McGregor but not Colin Kaepernick was being hypocritical do you think that's fair no yeah one McGregor is a good athlete right so yeah again I can't I can't even comment on Colin I've never watched a football game with him oh yeah perhaps at all but uh so the reason why I think like McGregor and Kaepernick is different is it's not like Conor McGregor is going into a UFC fight and trying to make this big political statement what Colin Kaepernick did was on the field right so I think that's a huge yes yeah so I guess and there are a lot of fighters who do say political things yeah it's strange because the media and MMA is very left-wing but there are a lot of right-wing fighters and actually UFC itself has been pretty good with supporting Trump yeah yeah I saw you sent me like a little homage to Trump but they did he's been not necessarily as politics but he's been a supporter of them as right one of the first fights they had was at a Trump Hotel I believe yeah yeah I mean I'm not surprised that that corner is has conservative leanings just based on the way that I know these fighters brains work right you know they're not he probably likes Trump because he's trying to pass like the first-step act you know criminal justice reform you like that uh but I love him hate him something that you've got a hand McGregor for like I and I'll admit this is that at least he seems genuine like I don't I don't really think this is a political stunt um and he's definitely not against he's not afraid to go against the grain I think it's safe to say right you don't have to love Trump you'd have to love McGregor I feel like what you see is what you get and he's just being unapologetically him kind of different though I would say from the whole vibe that Taylor Swift gives us because she's also in the news again okay so we're gonna get into that in just second before we do I need to tell you guys about Carson because cars today are like computers on wheels from electronically controlled transmissions to touchscreen displays the show and her change from being not not really politically outspoken even a political you could say to going full on yeah let me be essentially a campaign surrogate for the DNC and she I don't really follow her too closely but anytime she sneezes it ends up on a trending page so that's how I keep up with my Taylor Swift happenings she essentially seems to be launching this marketing push almost around her new woke persona right she's doing press releases about it she has a Netflix documentary coming out soon and a trailer for it was just released and by the looks of it it's going to lean heavily into the whole politics thing it's like [ __ ] this is like a whole new brand of Taylor Swift the trailer is like two minutes long but we have a little clip of it here label executives would just say a nice girl doesn't force their opinions on people a nice girl smiles and waves insist thank you I want to do this I need to be on the right side of history Taylor Swift broke her silence on politics so brave stunning inspirational and doesn't it just feel genuine yeah very very genuine I often have like what when I do things that are brave I make sure that I have camera crews and then like this whole documentary to kind of just explain my process you know Taylor Swift coming out and supported the Democrats who incidentally just coincidentally happen to the party of the media music industry the young and mostly female fans that she has you know just a brave break out move yeah I mean I will say I find some humor in this ironic humor because back in like I think 2016 2015 there are all these alt-right memes there she was like Aryan goddess that was like keeping quiet because it's like she was some kind of ice princess and I don't even know the thing is I still don't feel like I know her political beliefs cuz this is manufactured as possible and her delivery of them is about as elitist as I could possibly imagine yeah it's just the most like vapid pre-produced pre-approved political views for 2020 that you could possibly have anything that she is not she's not rocking the boat she's explicitly said in the past I don't think Democrats should be in fighting I think she said literally it's like if you're a Democrat get in the car we're going shopping or going to the mall something like that so it's like not even are you just like yeah I'm a Democrat you're not even having the balls to say all right but are you a Bernie person are you or bite in person right because then that could potentially be a big difference to also how cringe is it to say if you're a Democrat get in the car let's go to the mall oh no it's it's really nice that's boomer talk yeah I made fun of that and that I had like 50 angry Swifties in my mentions yeah those teenage girls men wait who do you think is a bigger celebrity between the two of them Taylor Swift Taylor Swift she's one of the oh yeah Taylor Swift first I guess I'm just yes but no really yeah I mean a mom is she right about that chat yeah okay among like 25 year-old or whatever maybe not but just worldwide the amount of if you asked someone on the street hey who's Conor McGregor or hey who's Taylor Swift Taylor Swift for sure really for sure no it's not even a question it's not even a question so I guess that Taylor Swift probably wanted some of those like glowing puff pieces by the media that they do about all the woke celebrities I mean we see Lily Allen got this kind of attention Colin Kaepernick's probably the biggest one Jameela Jamil she's kind of getting promoted like that who else Lena Dunham Amy Schumer right these like woke [ __ ] it gets you positive press you don't even need to have anything coming out but if you present yourself as like a champion for this social justice cause the media is gonna love you because they love social justice causes right so that makes it expedient sure makes it profitable I can actually respect the hustle I think but it doesn't make it brave right like anyone who's pretending or this documentary that seems to be painting and it's like this like huge coming-of-age like oh my god no that's she's doing what is best for her career this is it's just seems so calculated again what's actually brave love him or hate him agree when agree with him or not it's frankly like what Conor McGregor did giving your kudos of someone who is irrationally hated Donald Trump by pretty much all the people whose job it is to report on you to offer you sponsorships HR marketing departments are super super aggressive except your sponsorships again we're talking about like how do you tease and stuff managers or represent you in so many other things looting yourself firmly on the side of someone who they hate what about his own home country right there trumps approval Ireland isn't above 30 percent no know it for sure not you know that's a left-wing media all the way there I'm sure that that's not a good thing even for people in home countries yeah like I mean it's brave can you don't have to support him for but that's at the very least courageous well you know what I love about it though is that I don't think it was it there was no bravery in that calculation so just use what I think and I'm putting it out there yeah just like that's what you gotta love about it and I mean it and Trump doesn't himself a lot yeah I was gonna say I often take that approach with tweeting here's what I think it's in the ether now just make of it what you will but I mean just to kind of drive home how manufactured I think the whole Taylor Swift political thing is she did this interview with vogue because like I said like you have you take this progressive stance and all of these media outlets want to talk to you about it and coincidentally you have all of these talking points just you know pre-approved so she she did an interview with vogue to talk about her new documentary and also political engagement she also coincidentally has a song a political themed song to go in the documentary yeah would you look at that so here it is oh sorry it's not vogue its variety how midterm elections inspired Taylor Swift's new song only the young Taylor Swift recorded a song during her lover album sessions only the young that was held back and kept under wraps for the right occasion I wrote it after the midterm elections when there were so many young people who rallied for their candidate whether it was a senator or congressman or congresswoman yes Taylor those are the those are the names of those rolls very good it was hard to see so many people feel like they had canvassed and done everything and tried so hard I saw a lot of young people's hopes dashed and I found that to be particularly tragic because young people are the people who feel the worst effects of gun violence and student loans and trying to figure out how to start their lives and how to pay their bills and climate change and are we going to war all these horrific situations that we find ourselves facing right now because she literally just listed like everything that's listed on the woman's March like maybe in order even like it's just it's that whew that's specific okay key lyrics from the song only the young include you did all that you could do the game was rigged the ref got tricked the wrong ones think they're right we were outnumbered this time don't you love the depth of pop yeah it's just it's moving it's substantive it's it's modern poetry you know you can paste that into any era at any time anyway yeah I'm sure that's a vague and vapid it is exactly although it isn't specific about particular causes or political issues how convenient the track references forces that are quote too busy helping themselves we got to do it ourselves they're armed themselves with our sauce yeah which is really not a rhyme because your it selves themselves is the same so yeah it's like a marketing team or a PR firm after this entire thing I wouldn't even be surprised and I know historically people have done this like they have paid promotional pieces I know movies tend to do that I wouldn't be surprised this is essentially an ad for Taylor Swift two young women like to the women who went to the women's March kind of women it's like I don't like Conor McGregor I don't care for Taylor Swift but one celebrity is clearly in my opinion being more obnoxious and calculating with this while the other is doing something I think not that shocking right you're you're replying to a tweet from the president saying you support him only one is being celebrated by the media as being brave and this is this great undertaking she's finding her voice using her voice for positive change and then the other one is apparently doing something controversial right because there are all these pieces that were being released about her where people were shocked like you know a no stranger to controversy McGregor it's like really is this even how is this even news yeah so big difference in how the media has reacted to these different cases big difference in how fans have reacted I would like to know what you guys think if you're watching this I can probably get a handle on it do you think there's anything difference in the way they're bringing politics maybe into the public light am I are we being too mostly him being too kind to McGregor in this let us know okay so next up we have the Virginia gun rally this past Monday there was a pro Second Amendment rally in Virginia and that got lots of media coverage we're gonna be talking about that but before we do I need to give you guys a message from my friends at Freedom Works so Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi has finally released her sham impeachment articles and that means president Trump's fate now rests in the hands of the Senate and it's true that Republicans control the Senate but Ken guys can you really trust people moderates like Mitt Romney no Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins write Bukowski and Collins voted to save Obamacare Romney has done nothing in the Senate but attack the president thankfully my friends over at Freedom Works are launching a massive grassroots campaign to pressure these rhinos and the rest of the Senate to acquit President Trump and if you'd like to help them do that please text Lauren that's my name Lauren la you re and for one four nine zero to sign their petition now I don't know about you but I am sick and tired of hearing about this impeachment actually I know you guys are when I asked for subjects for the show so many people were like I'm tired of hearing about impeachment I feel you but we all know this has been nothing but a partisan witch hunt from the beginning and after wasting months of your time and tax dollars Democrats still have nothing on President Trump you know it I know what freedomworks knows it too but the question is do your Senators does Romney does Collins does Murkowski with the fate of Donald Trump's presidency hanging in the balance can you afford to stay silent and trust that they'll do the right thing I don't think so that's why I'm encouraging you to text Lauren again my name Lauren la you are en - 4 1 4 9 0 and signed Freedom Works petition demanding the Senate acquit President Trump immediately all right so Virginia you know I am NOT someone who kind of keeps up on a lot of the Second Amendment issues going on especially the ones on a state level I mean I support gun rights but you know there's so much going on in that arena I usually don't keep up on the latest bills unless they kind of make national headlines but apparently in Virginia and Ralph Northam who if you guys don't remember he is the one who either appeared in blackface or as a KKK member we don't know yet let us know what's the better option I think blackface I don't know the better option would be to not do that yeah and I love how he hasn't clarified because he knows it's losers yeah so they've got some new laws that they're wanting to pass things like limits on the number sorry of pistols handguns that you can buy per month they want to introduce things like red flag laws it's been pretty controversial so there was this rally this past Monday and the media for some reason we know the reason was so intent on branding the event as white nationalist or far-right or another Charlottesville that at first me against someone who isn't really tuned in to everything that's happening for a while actually believed it I was like ow is there is there another Charlottesville I I yeah I just it's easy to believe because the historical precedent I guess right yeah and everybody was saying it literally everybody was saying it this was how it's being reported if you guys think I'm exaggerating just look at this clip we have authorities in Richmond around how high alert it could be a tense day polarization what may happen in Virginia several hate groups supposedly some white nationalist white nationalist white nationalist white natural white nationalist groups white supremacist white supremacist white supremacist white extremist this entire rally stands in opposition to the meaning of this day Virginia on the edge how concerned are you that there might be some people in this crowd that may want to get violent or certainly a lot of concern by the way that clip was longer we had to trim it down there was a lot of that kind of thing um so it wasn't until I saw people who I actually know and trust saying whoa wait a second this is not this is not a white supremacist rally this is just a second amendment rally what actually had to look into it myself and I was like oh dang they're right I mean they're I think with any huge rally you have to be aware and just be I don't know careful of the fact that there are maybe some fringe elements that are going to show up Oh every it's always good I mean you can't always do anything about that I mean I uh I was immediately suspicious when I saw that one clip and I saw like out of all the flags the the one I saw the most by far i Fredo you call up mister don't tread on me snake oh yeah yeah alright yeah only libertarians and like Republicans where that's like that's not something that ypur supremacists really use yes don't get me wrong that's gonna be I think it already has been a dog whose dog whistle yeah cuz I know Chris Pratt I think it was worried that's right he got in trouble for that that's what it was yeah um so yeah it doesn't really make sense but so what I want to do is I want to go through some of the things that were being said about this rally because to me it's really interesting how something like I mean gun can gun control or gun rights depending on where you where you sit on that has become such a charged issue not just in terms of the come on missed opportunity not just in terms of the usual oh you're standing on the graves of dead children rhetoric but also now it's apparently you're you're racist for it it's like are we just using that term for everything even if it doesn't make sense we have some things I'd like to go through so representative Don Bayer he tweeted out annual gun lobby day protests in Richmond drew large numbers of white nationalist militias and racist conspiracy theorists this year neo-nazis tried to use this rally to launch violent attacks Trump's symbolism and memories of Charlottesville are vivid in many minds okay so you're using as many buzzwords as you can and I'm not saying like again if there were a handful of actual white nationalists at that rally I wouldn't blame the organizers I wouldn't blame the vast majority of attendees who had nothing to do with that but I feel like that's not even the case because if there was someone there who was holding up a Nazi flag or something or wearing a white hood I feel like that would be blowing up and I've not seen that yet yeah I know and doesn't it just make you think about how easy it is and I think there was actually a clip circulating about people infiltrating and doing just that kind of thing Yeah right like that would be if I was caught to be to subvert my political opponents you know I would go to an anti-fascist rally I'm not saying I would actually do this if I was in that mindset right or I would go to a right-wing rally with a Nazi flag yeah right that's perfect and then the whole media will just how they are the thing with not you can't really use that on antiva though because I don't know what you can do or say that's worse than how they actually present the media would cover it up of course yeah exactly they would only work in this case but that's why I mean I didn't see a single thing like that for know and I love how he mentions he just throws in Trump's symbolism and memories of Charlottesville are vivid in many minds today like why that has nothing to do with it a this has nothing to do with Trump right this is like Northam Virginia state level stuff Charlottesville is nothing like that but you're just trying to conjure up like hey remember that thing that was bad this is this is kind of like that thing that you don't like remember that we also had Ben Collins this one was a funny one and this was one of the this was the tweet that actually kind of made me wise to the fact that this wasn't actually a white nationalist rally just because of the amount of backlash it sparked he put out and he's an actual reporter reporters covering tomorrow's white nationalist rally in Virginia I'm absolutely begging you verify information before you send it out tomorrow even if it's a very sensational rumor you heard from a cop don't become a hero in neo Nazi propaganda circles with made-up stuff so he's tweeting out to other reporters hey don't put out fake news while actively putting out fake news which is impressive in a single tweet you've really become a meme of yourself and incidentally he is doing the exact thing he's warning other people do in terms of becoming neo Nazi propagandist I think there was you know what 20,000 I heard don't quote me on any particular number but there are thousands and thousands of people there I think the actual white nationalist the neo-nazis would love it if there was a rally for their college that big they would love it but that's not what happened and I don't know why in a weird way the media is carrying water for those guys it's almost like they kind of feed off of each other the white nationalists want the media to promote them so they can be like oh yeah there's so many of us you might as well yes too and then the media want the white nationalists to become a threat so they can get those tasty well that been Colin's tweet to me was almost like an animal farm like dog whistle it was like you know like you got to maintain the lie yeah it was what I understood in that yeah maybe he did delete that from what I understand I don't know if he like overtly apologized for him but he did delete it internet never forgets though so people grab some screenshots all right so next Alyssa Milano so there's kind of this there was this clip going around of a bunch of people open carrying and we have on that on that social media post just a screenshot of that people rope open carrying and walking down the street she wrote this is what's happening in Virginia right now Trump's America making it out as if it were some I don't I don't know like a death squad or something like that no yeah and I think just from reading different tweets that people were putting out I think a lot of people who are so against this are frankly like me and they didn't grow up around guns like they're not familiar with gun culture they probably don't know about gun laws I've made an effort to try to educate myself as best as I can and I don't think people like Alyssa Milano understand that like open carry is actually a pretty common thing it's a lot more calm then something like concealed-carry and when like these people carrying their guns don't have bullets in the chambers I know people were raising concerns about safety guns going off accidentally or purposefully it's like okay there's actually like a big deal that's made by gun owners so that doesn't happen like they've Believe It or Not thought about that and there were a good amount of people who are kind of giving her crap for that saying well what are they doing wrong like why why are you scared and people were saying this is actually you know there's all this debate over is the second amendment valid what did it even mean at the time there's a there's a good argument to be made that these people who are protesting you know some might say tyrannical laws are using the Second Amendment exactly how the founding fathers intended um Scott Hechinger it's probably not right this was weird said in New York black teenagers face a mandatory minimum of 3.5 years and maximum of 15 years in prison for simple possession of a firearm meanwhile in Virginia parades of white people in ski masks carrying assault weapons walk menacingly down the street on MLK Day and all is normal there are many things wrong with this okay first off people pointed this out possession of a firearm it needs to be an illegal firearm in New York right it's not just like any gun it's only if they have an illegal firearm second the laws in New York are not specific to black teenagers anybody it applies to everybody you can't just be like oh there's a gun oh no it's okay the guys white so you guys I'm a buck teenager well let him go this time yeah it doesn't work like that and also comparing what's happening in Virginia like these are totally different states like I'm not sure if New York has open carry but this is like that's a totally different state right yeah no I'm pretty sure New York's gun laws are they've they've almost denied the Second Amendment to themselves yeah that's right yeah which is what Virginians are standing up against in this case mm-hmm for sure and you can you can support virginia's ii remember ally or not but trying to put again this weird racial spin on it yeah and it's so ironic because like the people who are fighting for second Amendment rights they are fine with law-abiding black people owning firearms just like they are any race of people who again aren't criminals owning firearms who go through the proper means so it's yeah you just gotta love the characterization that all white people that gather together are somehow this its menacing yeah there was seeing other yeah I can I can feel it the white supremacy I mean why I like antifa literally rioting same with a black lives matter when that was more popular like burning cities and they're just like Oh protip passion its passion passionate protesters okay then we had David Hawk who's not really thing anymore but guns are kind of his jam so he tweeted this out how many of these people do you think would support the Black Panthers right to carry or armed resistance to the white militias that's told a North American continent answer none because they only want guns to enforce white supremacy I love that's a lot of like he's getting the racial thing in he's getting the you know European people stole the north it like he's getting all those things and again it's succinct a single a single post along you know to this guy becoming famous it's like a 1 year and a half ago maybe it's getting like time goes by fast now I will say but man this guy's taken the blue pill all the way oh for sure take the blue suppository this is this is ridiculous like is yeah and what so so many people have pointed out is that when we have a photo there were actually Black Panthers present at the rally because it turns out and you know not just Black Panther specifically as a group but there were many people who are passionate about Second Amendment rights who were black Asian Latino whatever race you can imagine because believe it or not you don't have to be I guess racially defined to think that righteous self protection is a good idea and actually so Talia Lavin Levin I always get it wrong she's um that I don't even want to say reporter but she's that person who was infamously fired after after she tweeted out that a well was it border patrol officer had a iron cross or Nazi tattoo turned out that that's not all what it was so she was fired from her job had a brief brief stint at I want to say New York University I don't think anyone signed up for a class or she got let go she just put out these tweets we don't have an insert for him but I will read them for you guys she wrote a piece called that pro-gun rally in Virginia wasn't exactly peaceful for GQ and you might be wondering oh did anyone actually get hurt no but but she's using peaceful in the kind of way that like words can be violent so like yeah so something cannot be peaceful even though technically yes it was peaceful okay so she says if I show up to your house with a thousand ak-47s and don't wind up shooting you is that a fun wholesome peaceful day for both of us so she's saying the presence of the gun is in and of itself violence which is not accurate she says in this scenario I also have hung a noose around an effigy of you and also have a guillotine as a as a prop chill peaceful s so that's that's not no okay um I know it's hard for someone like Talia lab and who is a just like an avowed leftist to understand the concept of self-defense right but having a gun is not a threat it's I think got at best a warning and I know people have criticized Second Amendment supporters before for saying stuff like come and get it or even Ben Shapiro mentioned before something with kids in public schools if you came and try to take my child I would use my second Amendment rights people like you're threatening him and he's like no no I don't say I think it's the same with these protesters this was not a threat this was just exercising their right and I don't think it's an accident that there was nothing nothing crazy that happened and I know again I think I share the mentality that a lot of these people do who weren't around guns where guns equals more danger but it's kind of had to train myself to think rationally about it which these people clearly have not even attempted to say if there was violence that would happen which I suppose is always a possibility no matter where you are it would be stopped real quick real quick like we saw at that church so apologies to all of the you know the protesters the rally participants who were smeared as white supremacist I'm pretty certain that you're not some you look suspiciously tent and I'm interested to see where this exactly I'm interested to see where this goes in Virginia I've heard some people say that they want to join West Virginia now just like West Virginia best Virginia question mark I don't know I only know that because I like that song is that a song I don't know yeah come on was there country song there country road yeah country that's okay but that's not a lyric yeah all right all right so we're moving on to I guess no better word for it gated generous e so on the show we we often criticize degeneracy child drag queens teaching young kids in school how to masturbate having for living boyfriends and letting one of them impregnate you honestly a lot of the things that happen at gay pride parades like the list goes on take your pick we we do a pretty good job of you know managing to find that stuff actually I feel like on the internet a lot of it finds you you will you will be met it's marketing writer man I I got caught washing a few clips on YouTube of my six 20-pound life the other day and said why why yeah what am i doing to myself I was wondering that's what's going on here yeah um sorry I got an awful mental image so any time we talk about one of those subjects and are critical of it there are always some people who react really negatively I think you said we got a response video made of us from when we did that one about relationship I am totally okay with being known as the person who is against that relationship I'm fine with that call me that all you want and there are always people who say stuff like oh you're being hateful you're being like anti LGBT you're such a fascist again the list of that also goes on just check out the comments section so I mean I don't think you have to hate people to disapprove of their behavior that may be a novel concept for some of these activists but I genuinely do believe that you don't have to hate gay people to not want kids to be sexualized or to not see public nudity and essentially what I think our public sex acts and you don't have to want a certain behavior band to recognize hey you probably should be doing it and especially probably shouldn't be doing it again in public right those those are my views I think they're reasonable I think they're non-controversial maybe some people disagree I saw an article the other day and the whole conversation is sparked seemed very familiar it seemed like exactly the kind of the type of stuff that we go through this article is from Brad Palumbo for the Washington Examiner he wrote DC's degenerate leather weekend annihilates gay progress there was a lot going on this weekend apparently we had women's March leather weekend gun rally on Monday just everything coming together the fight of course the fight of course MLK Day just school this past weekend he writes my boyfriend and I he is gay celebrated Restaurant Week in DC by going out to eat at a fancy Mexican joint that would usually be out of our budget and then we started rewatching Game of Thrones on HBO a slightly older gay man I know spend the weekend at home with his husband and their newly adopted infant across the country untold millions of gay people such as us what about their normal lives without making any headlines in the process meanwhile DC's degenerate gay community was busy celebrating leather weekend giving us all a bad name and annihilating what progress we've made homosexuals were wrongly malign for centuries as perverts and deviants modern left-wing gay people seem determined to keep up the public displays of debauchery that keep this stereotype alive I've written in these pages in the past month about the way this manifests itself during Pride Month every June I can agree with that as I wrote then at almost any pride event you'll find scantily clad marchers rainbow themed sex toys and profane posters the hyper-sexualization of the pride movement is so extreme that it's reinforcing the bias see some Americans still have against gay people according to liberal gay news outlets like the Washington Blade the mid-atlantic leather weekend or mal for short is a three-day party for leather kink and fetish enthusiasts that continues to grow in popularity with scores of pack venues across the district I bet you guys listening or watching right now wish you could go back to a time before you knew that but here we are the event doesn't appear to be exclusively gay or transgender focused but that overwhelmingly seems to have been the public slant the paper also reported two groups adding diversity to the festivities this year are the people of color kink leather experience apparently they like to be like to go by pockle and say TV a POC leather community both groups are hosting mal queer slash transgender people of color kinky queer events very niche audience I would imagine Friday and Saturday at the Hampton Inn Hampton Inn really okay many of events took on many of the events took place at gay bars and the agenda included events such as deviant a circle party sorry a circuit party and celebration for queer people of color as well as Sun gay described as an outdoor day party with leather aficionados muscle boys bears and more Brad writes this is not that kind of bear guys Brad writes this is disgusting but it's more than that it's eminently harmful to get Progress and acceptance for one it's bizarre to see anyone so openly boast about their sexual kinks and perversions they should certainly be free to do whatever they want but there's absolutely no reason to turn one's odd sexual fantasies into a public conversation or sorry public convention the bigger problem though is the way these people conflate their sexual deviancy with homosexuality there is in reality nothing about leather kink or fetishes that is at all related to homosexuality I would argue that these people are no different from heterosexuals with similar perversions so why the exhibitionism so to me completely reasonable take rate that's not outrageous that's not worthy of an angry tweet storm or name-calling I know what I've heard many many straight people with that kind of complaint complaint about preference for years now yeah it does seem like what Brad talked about in that article is genuinely felt by a portion community in fact including myself yeah and I hear that a lot of time whenever we cover these types of issues related to LGBT people I'll have people saying I don't mind if someone is LGBT I wouldn't hold it against them or treat them differently as a person but what I cannot stand are these public displays of debauchery or the feeling that you know we've tossed any sort of moral code or standards out the door which is exactly what Brad is talking about and I mean even if you don't agree with him I don't think it can be fair to say that his statements are homophobic apparently social media disagree because this was not a popular piece among certain groups I feel like you can know what those groups are I just think that like being gay is one thing being into a number of kinks or fetishes like that's one thing to try to conflate those two things though right act as if they're linked in some way and on top of that to do it all very publicly in this exhibitionist style of convention like I can see why Brad wrote this piece I really do understand it's the same kind of reasoning probably as why I made that video about the women's March right you see people who are claiming to speak for your group whatever that may be you disagree with them and you want to say hey like these I'm not with these people so there's one critique in particular that I wanted to go through it's one of the nicer ones more well thought-out ones it's by some someone named Yashar Ali on Twitter I do follow him I like a lot of his stuff disagree with him here though and we'll go over why this is number one for centuries we've been referred to and by the way he is gay as well as degenerates and deviance by people who wanted to kill us you using the same language he's referring to Brad against the community you are a part of makes me really sad you know what halts progress in the LGBT community Brad shame okay so it's true gay people historically have been referred to as too generous and deviants but even if you're someone who is totally on board with gay rights that doesn't mean that degenerates and deviants no longer exists because you don't think that is the average gay person not at all I mean and I get this all the time I get called like a neo-nazi or things for using the word too generous see but all it means is just morally repugnant behavior unacceptable behavior right and is Brad because he's gay now unable to call out anything he finds distasteful or threatening to gay rights and gay acceptance it just I'm I'm not really understanding it there I mean I'll be honest right if there was a you know they did have a straight predator ate a thing but if straight Pride Parade let's say in our hypothetical universe was exactly what like that you know where you can find videos online of those of those prayers that are yeah I won't even talk about their content camera yeah let alone give you clips of them because you know yeah this is bad you know if straight pride was like that at all I would say you know of course yeah you know yeah I'm just socially conservative that's the way I am if I'm in uh if I'm with guys in a locker room I don't even dig the locker room talking hey I get angry at what's going on here you know because I think that it's it's a culture of sickness in a lot of ways it yeah and it's you see it on open display in your the openness of your downtown in your cities on an annual basis now right mm-hmm and it's it's kind of sad that now not only is that why like something but even speaking out against that yeah it is controversial speaking out against that while firm and firmly like broad was obviously doing maintaining that gay people are just regular people that's controversial and he says you know what halts progress in the LGBT community Brad shame so you're like Brad is not saying you need to be ashamed if you're gay he's saying that there are some unacceptable behaviors out there especially publicly and yes gay people like straight people can engage in those behaviors like so we're just abandoning shame as like a general concept we can do whatever we want and should feel good about it no I think we from an honor shame background I grew up in Asia and actually you know there are a lot of people in the West too who embraced that mentality though it's not the norm here and I think like having shame is an acknowledgment that you've done something you shouldn't have and it can be a huge motivator to improve yourself right I think a world where we have no shame where everything is just out on the table that's not a world where we seek to better ourselves right and I don't think just getting rid of shame entirely because it's been misused in the past is the answer he continues that the idea that people who hate LGBTQ people are somehow going to respect us if we do stuff acceptable to them is absurd they're not degenerates and deviants they're human beings who enjoy something different something that does not impact anyone but them okay so first off there are studies out there that show that acceptance toward LGBT people is actually backsliding right not huge but people are a little bit more uncomfortable around the LGBT community than they used to be mmm those haven't even do with dancing eight-year-olds maybe maybe perhaps because you know I think saying that like LGBTQ people who hate LGBT people they're just gonna hate us no matter what you're painting the issue with way too broad a stroke right there are people out there tons of people who don't care what you do in your bedroom but they're starting to associate and it's no wonder that they're starting to associate being LGBT with all of these you know over sexualized behaviors and that's what's making them uncomfortable right it doesn't mean that they hate gay people and even for the people who say hey I believe marriage should be between a man and a woman you partaking in those behaviors is only solidifying the wrong idea that they have that the people and leather colors represent all of LGBT people right and I think like just saying oh they're gonna hate us no matter what therefore I should be free to indulge in the worst behavior possible that's not good for anybody right and it's like they it's how I believe Christians should act it doesn't matter if you know this person is now we're gonna become a Christian or whatever and you really disagree with them act your best right be your best be representative for your community and same if you're you know if you're an LGBT person feel free to live your life without doing all the stuff that we see ad pride parades and I think if everyone held themselves to those standards we'd get along a lot better we'd begin viewing each other a lot better it's just yeah okay they're not degenerates and deviants they're human beings who enjoy something different okay there there are different preferences right not every different preferences to generate some are some are right I think that's just know so some things are not okay we're gonna get to one of those things in just a second anybody finishes the question is and I know the answer why don't all of the straight leather kink people reflect poorly on the straight community isn't that sorry isn't interesting that all the stuff only reflects on the straight people who engage in it and not the straight people overall like Brad mentioned and I think he did this specifically they're calling themselves like the LGBT this the LGBT this when you always brand yourself with people who could associate it I know there's also the issue of proportionality yeah I mean I can't count almost anyone my life that I know is into leather and or anything that you know well guess what they don't go to parades yeah so you know what but look there's a much bigger overlap I'd wager and I haven't seen any studies or statistics in fact I doubt they exist as to the overlap between people that like go to straight leather kink parades and people that go to LGBT parades but I bet you there's a very large overlap and that's one of the culture i-i've had LGBT friends who have complained that they want to just find you know a regular partner to settle down with have a family but there's so much of the like sexual promiscuity and things like that that it's hard for them to do and I feel really bad for people like that I feel bad for people who you know see these people doing things that they don't approve of and not only are they doing that they're kind of saying hey they're declaring themselves representatives of what you are is this is the same feeling I that I feel I think with stuff like the women's March but the LGBT community does it so much more in a disproportionate way yeah I side with Brad on this I honestly do I don't think there was anything wrong with what he said you know there are people calling him like the gay equivalent of Uncle Tom one of the bad gays and it's like no he's just he's a gay person who doesn't want to see leather kink conventions at the Hampton Inn unabashed sexual hedonism in the open streets yeah and I think he's right this is doing and we see it actually objectively more harm to gay acceptance and I think people like Dave rubric Dave Rubin like Brad who can show people that hey I'm I'm a person who happens to be gay it's not my identity it's not my personality doesn't mean I'm gonna show up in like a [ __ ] suit or anything like that those types of people do way more to further acceptance then someone who's attending one of these conventions and trying to make this huge statement of it so okay the idea that it's just different preferences doesn't make it to generate I saw this post on social media the other day has nothing to do with like LGBT whatever just because I don't think those things are synonymous despite what some critics might say this person said mother and daughter subscribe to our only fans my only fans and then her URL mother's only fans her URL so if you're listening on an audio platform basically some mother and a daughter in lingerie in front of a mirror in what some people pointed out was a messy mirror I like a lot of people were like WTF what is this and I you know said as much most people agreed with me right most people were like yeah that is messed up a shocking number though too many in my opinion were like what's wrong with that though what's wrong with that you know they're both consenting adults like yeah they're saying yes what's wrong with that and I mean listen there's far worse than this going on don't get me wrong like but this is this is an instance where you say exactly what we would say to those LGBT parades yeah this is a generate this is deviant yep yeah it's unacceptable and an attendance it's disappointing that we've got no place in society where you not only can you find the stuff is it's it's public right and people are like what's wrong with it when you try to criticize like what's wrong with it there's like a good City like what's wrong with it don't you love freedom I thought you loved freedom okay you don't I mean so this did turn out to be a scam I hate the people who told us this because it means they tried to pay and they actually think did pay turns out they're not related or something like that but yeah um thank God enabling the sexualization of your child that is degenerate that is deviant doesn't matter if your child is of age you're still the parent in the situation you shouldn't be doing that setting an example that's selling nudes online is a good choice for your child you're still the parent you shouldn't be doing that there are so many wreaths so many reasons enabling your child to sexually explore this is like the reasons go on as to why this is not okay and I can say yeah but it should be legal I'm not saying that we should you know find these women lock them up but we should at least be able to say okay this is like that's not good right you shouldn't want this for your daughter or anyone you know it's just bad and yeah it's it's a dark world out there and I think we are getting to a point where it's going to become more and more unpopular to not only not do it but to actually speak against it which is scary I'm so props to Brad for writing that piece and I'm sorry deal with some negative backlash for it but I think I think it is important that he said something it's pretty much all we have to say for now though and if you guys are watching live be sure to stay on this stream because we're gonna be back in just a few seconds going over the super chats
