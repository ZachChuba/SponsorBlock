[Music] hi i'm peter beck i'm the founder and ceo of rocket lab why don't you join me on a bit of a tour of these facilities [Music] so right now i'm standing in between the composite line and the final assembly line so behind me all of the carbon composite tubes and parts of the launch vehicle are manufactured then they transition over to the final assembly line where everything gets bolted onto them and then finally they shoot out the door and down to the launch site a rocket lab quality is always number one and as you walk around this factory you'll see that not any tool is out of place everything is in its own place you can eat off the floors and this facility is absolutely organized and beautiful within this industry there's a lot of talk about factories of the future you're standing in a factory of the future and it's not a cat image it is up and running and every 20 days a rocket rolls off this production line raw material in one door 20 days later rock it out the other everything is done here and the other factories so in this particular factory we have a whole lot of composites we have machine shop 3d printing avionics clean rooms at the rocket lab facility here in long beach we have a lot of things under one roof we have engine development we have avionics development we build solar panels we have a vast array of cnc machines and 3d printers that allow us to build all these things and test all these items in-house here in long beach so our machine shop facilities have two key functions firstly is vertical integration and keeping our costs down so we can manufacture our flight components much much cheaper in-house than if we were to outsource them but secondly we are still an evolving r d organization we push the limits we've got our space systems division we're going to the moon we are constantly iterating we've got hyper curie coming online they are an iterative process of development and so you want to be able to turn around new parts really fast we want to have that new design on the test stand tomorrow the only way you're going to do that is if you maintain that capability in a house we're extremely vertically integrated as a result we really understand that product really well we've proven that through 20 20 plus flights automation has been a really key part of our composites division so raw material fibre comes in it's automated into components and then those components go into a giant machine called rosy the robot and within rosie all those components are transformed into their finished products and then out on the production line all within about 12 hours you know just about everything we've done in our history has included some carbon composites of some description so not only do we build launch vehicles here uh but also of our spacecraft components behind me you see the composites clean room and then just over there we've got composite spacecraft elements that are used on the capstone mission and many other missions that are going to far destinations so in the last year our space systems division has doubled and we intend to double again this year we make flight computers we make batteries we make radios we make solar panels all in-house all vertically integrated in order to facilitate the development of full spacecraft we also have a facility here and a laboratory where we can do calibrations for reaction wheels star trackers and all the equipment that's required for guidance navigation and control systems of spacecraft rocket lab is responsible for a lot of firsts one of the most important being actually 3d printing of rocket engine and rocket engine components we are the 3d printing experts within the space industry our first rocket engine was 3d printed over eight years ago and now we have 200 of them that have gone to space what 3d printing enables us to do is meet our manufacturing rate and that's one engine every 24 hours within rocket lab we have multiple factories placed all around the globe the engines are produced up in the long beach factory and they arrive down here to new zealand where they're tested and then finally integrated onto the launch vehicle and then ultimately launched to space before the launch vehicle gets to the launch site the elements of the launch vehicle go through a significant amount of testing for propulsion test complexes this enables us to begin testing right down from the engine hot fire level through to stage testing uh through the final assembly before it shipped to the launch site so at rocket lab we run a very very deep hardware in the loop program so basically the whole launch vehicle is laid out or actually use the components of the launch vehicle to simulate flights and in the build of the vehicle as it's coming down the production line the hiddle guys will be able to determine uh if there's an error in the launch vehicle before it's even built and those guys can actually fly that launch vehicle to orbit before it's even built on the factory and determine if there's any issues with any of those calibrations all of our facilities around the world incorporate not just production but all of our design and analysis and development teams and i think that's critically important to not segregate your production from also your engineering and your design so throughout all our facilities all of those functions are distributed like our team has perfected manufacturing uh the next step for us is reusability and recovery and we've already had multiple successful re-enter re-entries and also two successful splashdowns we've actually recovered the booster in wonderful shape and right in front of me here is actually the next recovery booster on the way down the production line so what that really means is that from a manufacturing perspective we don't have to build as many rockets because we can literally bring these launch vehicles back in these rockets back refurbish them put them back on the line and fly them again so these factories represent a huge investment by the company over over many many years and we've got to the point now with these factories where uh you know any changes that we need to do to the launch vehicle or any increase in production it is really quite trivial right behind you you see the mission operations center for space systems we currently operate two spacecraft on orbit all of our future spacecraft for space systems will be operated right out of here in our headquarters in long beach california it's co-located with our engineering department allows for fast iteration with the team and allows for seamless operations and calibrations of the systems that we launch we're doing a vast portfolio of missions here all the way from low earth orbit to interplanetary here at the space systems division in long beach we're doing a mission to mars which is two spacecraft for a nasa mission called escapade we're also doing several leo missions for commercial and government customers that'll exercise the full capabilities of the engineering staff here in long beach our first launch site is launch complex one located in the mahi peninsula new zealand it is the world's first privately operated launch site capable of 120 launches appear the reason we can achieve such a high launch frequency out of lc1 is that we're located in a very remote part of the world and wide access to azimuts and inclinations gives us high frequency but also high access to a range of orbits having two pads at lc1 offers incredible flexibility we're no longer constrained by particular customers delays or what's going on at a specific launch pad with a specific launch vehicle so the two pads fundamentally enables frequency but you know it also gives us the backup and redundancy should we need more opportunities in short order the beauty of owning your own launch site is that if we want to go tomorrow we launch tomorrow lc1 is home to many world-class facilities that support launch on top of the two launch pads that we have we have a host of clean rooms um even capable of processing uh spacecraft fueling activities at the launch site itself we've also got an integration facility for the launch vehicle we also host the range control center uh two kilometers away from the launch pad that house our critical operators before launch so operating our own site at lc1 gives us incredible flexibility we essentially own the schedules we determine when vehicles can get launched and can get wet dressed and tested part of that includes operating our own range safety team so we have no reliance on external contractors or government entities to provide that service what that enables again is incredible flexibility we control the spend we control the way we operate and therefore allows us to provide a very lean commercially viable service so in support of our tests and launch sites we have four key control centers two mission control centers and two range control centers they're all interconnected and it doesn't matter where you are you can support a test or launch operation from any one of these sites and this enables us to deliver a global launch capability whether it's for a launch service or a satellite service a launch complex 2 is based on wallops island virginia it was strategically selected to be in virginia again primarily because of its low activity we've got access to a relatively high part of the launch calendar at wallops itself also includes the integration control facility that's located off base so it's completely deconflicted from any on base operations the icf is a one-stop shop it's the place where we integrate our payloads onto electrons as well as house the local operations team to come and control the launch having built multiple launch sites in the past we certainly have the ability to to set up shop really anywhere on the planet we've been able to navigate local regulations and meet all the compliance requirements as well as do the infrastructure get the engineering done in record time so you can't have launch and spacecraft operations without a network of ground stations we own and operate some of our own ground stations as well as a strategic partnership with ksat that gives us ability to get data from launch or space on demand one of the strongest attributes of rocket lab is the team and no no more is this prevalent than the production team so these guys here have put 20 launch vehicles on the pad and as you can see around me probably another 10 in in production and you know the team here is the best in the world rocket lab is really really well known for taking incredibly complex aerospace structures and components and systems and just producing them at volume
