[Music] hey what's up as filmmakers on YouTube we come up with lots of weird ideas we write them down on paper and hope that one day they come to life today is one of those days because as you can see behind me we have a lot of Tanks yes that's right we are at drive a tank in Kasota Minnesota that's right our home state and we are super excited this is the United States's first recreational tank driving facility we have a special involving tanks you down we're down let me introduce to you the story of me mom first thing on the list today we have to location scout we've written script however we haven't seen what the mobile home the key location in this we don't know what it looks like on the inside hopefully the kind of lines up if it doesn't well we're gonna have to restructure the script today because we're shooting tomorrow you get my back we're just like a mystery chemicals you just spray it on the back of hand then you go like this freakin love how big tanks are people easily forget how how small you are cleared it's a tactical smoke maneuver there's at least three climate changes coming out of that story this house is how I've heard is that this actually belonged to a convicted felon convicted two weeks ago and now this was just left because he's gonna be in jail for a long time in the toilet like other anyway you're not even there on the floor it has to feel like Nima's actual house that you need to live there we have to go thrift store shop in Goodwill's hit up some furniture get everything just to make it feel like a bit of a home set deck and props and just some of the stuff particularly bring this whole thing together it's so much fun oh yeah this in one transaction was at least 2530 one happy thank you so much are you sure that we will be around the back to get the furniture oh my god this is the Extreme Home Makeover here we have this place there is just nightmares all over this mobile home so we're here to make it our dream home they're basically taking everything apart and putting it back together and again like Legos this for example this is this is what would happen if you hired me to be a contractor at your house we're making it look like the house is it at least like reasonable like will be believe lived in just barely livable oh my god oh my god this is so legit you guys so you have a couch instead of making that the bedroom we can double down and just make up in dope living room yeah I have it welcome to me most cribs this place was a total hole before we got here and we made this whole thing a me mas dream start in the kitchen here Kitchen Rules read these or you don't get the hang out with us all right this is where we keep our stove here you can see the printers underneath lighting those far as we start we literally like the woman what Bernie so we have our drawers here our cabinets that bolted shut dirty forks in the sink to be washed all right we have our food we have our cookies our cheese nips little nips up in there best books ever you know what honestly it is the only one I tried to read it's the Star Wars science fair book I like the pictures over here we have the best collectibles you've ever seen poor swimmers porcelain baby boys crystalline eggs not candy yet porcelain thing I don't know what's going on but you know what you want to see a porcelain thing that's gonna blow your mind this is a hard fair man only hard bears in Biman Taos moving over we have our couch this world whereas this is where we eat and dine in peace with our strawberries and Butterworth's table over here you know having some tea over here this is where the magic happens we got my dirty pants we got my dolls secret treasure box we're gonna fill that with my treasures we have our bed where I sleep don't don't touch it or sit on it it's actually full Spike's this this girl the ear like it's it started sliding down it's called sliding your disease it slid all the way down the chin and last not least we have my closet where does I keep my nice clothes the room we've all been waiting for the savvy savvy deaf room where we keep all the banned chemicals and asbestos that's where I'm Iman throws people who get punished welcomes my freedom last thing I bet you on Sam the cub G thing I knew 20 bucks for that and now you're gonna owe me 20 more because Sam just bet me he wouldn't say the word me ma tomorrow I said it like it up to 200 times today that meat and listen to my voice you hear me you hear this voice it's not gonna say those words again he's gonna say it again before 10 a.m. he does they mean or grandmother he really owes me $80 tell you what you pay it in advance you only owe me 30 however this as a man who is very familiar with these fictional kind of debts fantasy debts how do we put this but-but-but okay what does this push-up debt you have these thousands of push-ups whoa hey Sam that's a debt with another party it's irrelevant to you don't concern yourself with that all right you got it so leverage maybe if I lose all I'll be able to relate it was a dad that I was already forgiven the audience forgive me and if you pay me now you only need to pay me 30 no because I believe I have a shot at winning this move over this bet not that I'm gonna you're gonna sell me my marijuana again a.m. tomorrow me ma that's gotta burn that name out of my mind it's not gonna happen man for you let's forget it we even brought with us our goal is think and to say me mom before noon always right there sitting today is that so you basically are getting in here and it's not hard to find start with mee maws before 9 a.m. Sam said me ma day 2 of the world of tanks shoot from way back to the location yesterday visit all the meaty dialogue and kind of the specialized shots that we needed before the big tank did and when we get to actually run over a entire house today should be a fun day we all got to be hands on deck we're gonna be running multiple cameras multiple GoPros we're all gonna have to run in there after each erected to cut fish out cameras but it's gonna make for some awesome footage [Music] [Music] cut should I have them turn around and reset is that it you're good with that this serves to show the power of the vehicles that are coming towards the home which I don't think I need to say anything more than that we have a good friend on set today a good friend of mine which I will introduce you to shortly are you playing the game of life bro you play the game of life you guys know each other yeah we do we don't wave at way back we're gonna outfit you some let you hear it up yes ma'am reveille what's up everybody new to me like watch it all and we put it all together in one day thank you and we're gonna be getting crazy shots we're gonna be so frozen you're strolling the tank busting into the rigs yeah you run up and you say guys we have to get out of here it's literally the apocalypse come on okay you like saying it literally be upon his face cells me because he's like that's a wrap 15 minute cameo that is awesome we're here today filming another war bit and I got to say Christian and Quinn's are completely out of line when it comes to their costumes they're trying to play goons today and I've been talking about the goon life for many videos now and I'm trying to show him the right way clearly these guys don't even match they don't look anything like me I think it's honestly I think it's terrible uniforms is fun horrible what is this this light blue how easy this is to see hey young man stand down before your troops Michael hawk are you here to kill me no yes that's you straight I'm here to let you know that actually the way that these guys are operating is a very viable strategic technique because of the mismatched uniform the enemy cannot tell if they're actually combatants if their friends or foes if they're civilians or not they can hide in plain sight they can easily dawn or more equipment and go in and make an attack and then they can strip some stuff off and blend right back into the populism so actually what they're doing is a very good stretch so stand corrected young man and drive on one thing about today is that we learned a lot about not only how a pcs in tanks work but also how mobile homes are constructed running em over lengthwise is a bad idea because the strongest structural points are on either end so we decided to switch the whole video to make it perpendicular cutting the thing in half here's the challenge we need to shoot more than one shot in the house while it's being crushed so we need to do it in stages crush it a little bit film a little bit crush it a little bit bit a little bit we're doing it in four increments because we strive to this video to account for a total of four crushes now we have no idea if the whole thing is just gonna flatten out the moment the tank bumps into it we have no idea if the ceilings gonna cave in is one big piece if it'll go down in chunks can we crush one room without crushing all the others at the same time we're set of cameras all over the place also we don't want the cameras and memory cards to get destroyed so how are we gonna do this well I think the first step for us is finding some of these beams that are kind of holding up a lot of the structural weight placing the GoPros on these areas or kind of underneath them we're gonna film some composite shots where walk off the camera Clinton dives out of the way and then we ideally I've no idea what's gonna happen ideally are able to composite him basically into a close call with the APC and we're gonna do that throughout the day a bunch of times if it doesn't go well definitely gonna have a little bit of a situation on our hands you literally reel the entire piece around these four shots I'm nervously excited man I feel like an extra 5 degrees hotter I'm a blood is fun little faster cuz my heart is beatin so running five cameras in the house three cameras outside the house this is gonna be a dope shot it's gonna be basically a cinematic shot of the hallway and the tanks gonna go look wipe the hallway it's good and just as a heads-up I'm gonna roll all the cameras we are going to film this shot of him exiting once Clint and myself are both outside and give you the thumbs up yeah that means they're ready to go that means the cameras are still rolling okay okay yeah all right here we go we are rolling the cameras action no one rolling yeah get my nose rolling rolling the driver [Music] [Music] it was mathematical way to get in there and in there that was awesome dude that couldn't work out better once he's out of there and they give us the okay we got to find all our GoPros PC you know it was behind the couch so behind the oh it's still it was still rolling yeah they're all good so the sealy stayed up which is really interesting it's like a kraj door like when it came through the other side wasn't expecting that at all Sam's beautiful counters three more to go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] that's a wrap I've been and for the next 15 minutes the longest series of high-fives was recorded so after two of the most grueling days of our lives we're finally done with the truth and it's going to be incredible guys check out the video right now in the quarter channel
