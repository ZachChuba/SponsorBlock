so autopilot and I are happily driving so you can see that high curvature blinking and it thought that was a stop sign that's really weird I'm glad it didn't try to stop at it oh and this semi puts its turn signal on right as we get next to him oh my gosh there's a ladder in the road there autopilot is so smooth right now and oh oh we got this guy merging okay what has gone on everybody welcome back to Tesla challenge this is episode number 22 I want to say our 23 I really cannot remember we've had so many so far if you're new to Tesla challenge welcome this is where I take Tesla's autopilot and full self-driving features and put them to the test I try to do exactly what Tesla says the car is capable of doing and normally that consists of highway driving on ramp to off-ramp Tesla says the car can do interchanges change lanes all that kind of stuff and keep you safe the whole time so we're gonna do that I'm gonna get on the highway here I'm going to turn autopilot on I'm driving for about an hour today probably 50 minutes or so if that will be on the highway and once I turn autopilot off the goal is that or sorry once I turn autopilot on the goal is I will not turn it off and the car will do everything so I will keep my hand on the wheel the whole time so there we go autopilot is turned on I'll set my speed I like a speed of 78 so once I set that speed I won't be doing anything else so right now the car is doing all the driving you can tell we ran navigate on autopilot with that blue line I'll just show you if I take over autopilot off so you know I am NOT steering because if I steer you hear that noise the blue line goes away so I think it's maybe 40 miles or so today I'm really not sure but the car is going super slow I wish it would speed up I'm gonna allow it to do its thing it is speeding up a little bit and turning on turn signal so it's merging on here a little too slow for my liking but we're going so we have multiple interchanges today we'll be doing those cars gonna do everything like I said I'm going too low and I will keep a hand on the wheel the whole time for safety Tesla says you are supposed to do that so seventy-eight is the speed I like and turn signal is turning on to take our first interchange right off the bat so really good there just so you know this to get 15% off anything on their entire website and then I also want to say welcome to the front so with that said we will head off here I used to do a grading system the the videos have changed over time and I used to grade and then I let you guys grade well YouTube is actually or they already have removed that feature where you could in the top left of the top right of the video you could click a little thing and leave your grade well it's gone so I guess we're not gonna do that anymore I'll give you my grade I'll tell you you know ABC how I think it did wow really good already already getting over right away because this Lane does end that's awesome I'll tell you how I think autopilot did and you can let me know down in the comments below what you think so watch the whole video kind of analyze if you think the car is doing a good job or not we all have our you know opinions on if the car make good moves or not so with everything said I think that's it let's see see how the car desk [Music] okay so passing that semi I would assume we are now gonna get out of the passing lane the car is supposed to do that when it's able and I find most of the time it's very good at it but sometimes like now it doesn't do it we've got lots of nice orange barrels being detected over there and I'm already a little bit annoyed with this because I wish it would move out of the passing way and I do have somebody behind me they're not right up on me yet but it seems like they do want to pass and the car is just just sitting here so I don't know I know for you guys not as much but it is pretty stressful for me gonna be sitting here somebody behind me they quit early want to pass on my car will Matt get over it's so annoying and I just want to hit the turn signal to get over but we just started so I'm trying to resist for you guys [Music] okay passing the final car if we don't get over after this I'm just gonna do it myself I'm gonna give it oh okay what a relief thank you so much turn signals on nicely moving over I didn't have to do anything here comes this guy blasting by me hey told you it doesn't you can't tell they look a lot farther away in this camera but yeah that guy definitely wanted to pass me all right so lots of traffic here we have someone coming up on our left but they moved car waited for them really good maneuver there and we can speed up a bit more to let these other people merge on stay out of their way [Music] [Music] okay so we're coming up to our first or no second interchange where Eddie did one interchange in point nine miles so card just indicated it wants to change lanes to follow route it knows it needs to get over again I'm not doing anything here and now that it's clear well there is a car there but there's enough room to get over all right that's good nice job Tesla and then we're gonna take this exit it's pretty tight Bend and I usually get this morning message of high curvature and then you have to like right away change lanes to the left otherwise you continue and you'll get back on the same highway so let's hope there's not too much traffic or if there is the car can handle it so you can see that high curvature blinking and it thought that was a stop sign that's really weird I'm glad it didn't try to stop at it but high curvature detected but no problems it's doing fine and then we need to immediately move to the left which there are no cars coming so that shouldn't be a problem there we go very good move really fast did that right away like it needed to we can continue on [Music] who what is this guy doing oh my gosh he's gonna crack I thought he was gonna like fly into our lane he's doing kind of on the edge but I guess he's okay so a nice big five-lane highway here this is a lot of traffic a lot of cars to enter mean we're going quickly oh I'm gonna put my speed back to 78 it used to after interchanges auto pilot used to put your speed back to what you said it it slows it down as you go through the interchange but now it just puts it back to your kind of preset default which is kind of annoying I guess it's better than going too fast but yeah so not too much traffic in terms of slowing us down but there are a lot of cars all over the place to interact with but so far autopilot is doing great I mean full self-driving software is doing an awesome job it's been getting better and better so I'm happy so far oh and this semi puts his turn signal on right as we get next to him he obviously sees us and no big deal so he's gonna wait for us to get out of the way and he's gonna move over like immediately the second he has one inch [Music] changing out of passing lane this is not a passing lane that's really weird I've never seen that before where it says not a passing lane but it's wrong huh oh my gosh there's a ladder in the road there wow I didn't see it to the last second luckily it was not in our way cuz autopilot would not have done anything about that I assume you know you see those videos were so autopilot sort of to avoid yeah I don't believe pretty much any of those but wow that was we're lucky it wasn't in our way I think I would have swerved I woulda had time to move I saw it coming up but I didn't know what it was and then really good manoeuvre they're going around that truck that was going really slow like quickly and then moving back changing lanes to follow route we do have to be to the right up here so and so smooth autopilot is so smooth right now and oh oh my gosh oh my gosh okay so then I thought this guy was gonna wow I've never seen that warning it thought this car was gonna bump into us I saw what they were doing and I was ready to pull over but I wanted to let autopilot do its thing and they entered our lane to kind of move away from that truck which great moved by them autopilot hit the brakes didn't come close to hitting them gave me a warning to let me know what was going on really really solid [Music] oh we got this guy merging okay you could see autopilot was tracking him I don't know that was a fine move I guess I probably would have blown by them but then autopilot sees you a little safer so that's good Oh moving into fresh land on the right I like it there's too much going on on the left let's see the right is wide open so let's take advantage okay there's a lot going on we're about to squish ourself in between two semis which I guess is okay all good guys get out of the way so we do need to be here for our next move come on speed up okay so we are about to get off the highway here and I'll probably just cut that part out for you I'm going over to another highway but there's some turns and stuff which I have to do full self-driving can do that yet and then we can continue when we're back on the next highway so I have to this exit I'll have to manually change lanes because you'll see navigate an autopilot is gonna turn off yep so this is ending and then I will let it handle all the stoplights there's several I'll be going through it's very boring and annoying but it'll be fun with the new stoplights ability amazing you can see well now it's not there but it's all that red light I don't know how I can see it through the truck's window there used a lot of the stop sign or stoplight ability and it's working so much better on this update I'm really happy with it impressed but anyway we are on the next part of the highway here we're about to get on you'll see these two lines will merge into one my preferred speed is 78 so we will leave that and hopefully autopilot can finish our journey for us we don't have much more to go so we were at 32 so we're about 32 highway miles so far I think we're gonna add another five to ten or so and hopefully autopilot can do the rest of it and take our exit for us so right lane ends here and for a while this is indicated it's gonna do a lane change to follow route I don't know exactly what it's waiting for probably waiting you know for somebody to be directly next to us yep so lanes ending here all right there we go so not bad I don't know a little later than I would have done but whatever all right so changing lanes to follow route we're about to exit I prefer this part of the road oh so much quieter I wish we were here the whole time that's all right car gets to decide what we do but it looks like we're gonna be successful here you know not super exciting I mean there were some good parts where the car was gonna come over in the friggin ladder in the road and some like that but watch some of the older if you haven't seen some of the older Tesla challenges like like maybe one through five or something like that and the guy was always doing crazy stuff like changing lanes and then bailing and I don't know just all kinds of crazy stuff and now we're at the point where it's like yep on ramp to off-ramp I didn't do anything yep that's kinda how it goes with autopilot but let's not speak too soon let's let the car finish up take this final exit and then we'll give it a grade which I think is gonna be pretty good so here it is our final exit car should turn the turn signal on and there are ghosts we're done great job autopilot you're getting an A from me a little bit a little bit of weirdness in the beginning with staying in the passing lane but I think that those cars are going slow and that's why but I excellent job highway about 40 miles on highway I did nothing nothing nothing nothing except a hand on the wheel off highway I made it two or three lane changes and one right turn that's literally all I did and then hitting this stock to tell it you know yes it's green you can go so this stuff is just so impressive it's so cool I do want to say in my last video in my last video a lot of people were commenting they liked my shirt there is I do have some merch below the video I don't talk about it too much because I don't want you to think I'm you know trying to sell you things but it's down there if you're interested if you'd like the shirt it said full self-driving car in structure because that's what we are right if we're using the system we are teaching it when the lights green and red and when to go and change lanes and all that stuff so I hope you enjoyed this one I look forward to hearing your comments what you think how you think the car did who there's a roundabout up there maybe I should try it and having a conversation with you down in the comments so I hope you enjoyed this and I you will see my car in the next video so auto pilot and I are happily driving along [Music]
