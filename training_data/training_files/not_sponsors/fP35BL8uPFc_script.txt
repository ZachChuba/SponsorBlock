mixed back there with the obs oh maybe because you changed the main window yes i hate it again again uh don't worry guys i'm gonna fix it right now so okay uh something new from g friend actually it's um sorry a couple of days old but uh but so many of you constantly until now until now so we're gonna check it out gonna follow your re requests i can't talk anymore it's too late oh i'm sorry gotta adjust no sound but it does sound for the viewers but not for us for some reason i'll just fire jordan yeah obs is playing some tricks again [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] i mean the sentence infused me with pleasure in in my in my brain it's it's completely it takes a completely odd way but but sexual but you know i mean maybe i'm just a perfect [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] me [Music] me [Music] they just made it look like they were almost kissing but then the apple ah nice twist nice twist with the apple i almost fell for it i was hoping but okay [Music] so many symbolic stuff going on [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] is [Music] whoa okay uh i really liked it and i read um i think it was manfred who wrote yes yeah i think i think so i'm sorry if it wasn't you but i think it was you um wrote well we already reacted to one song from g friend yeah but that was a long long time ago and apparently we didn't like it as much but i really like that one yeah i mean i really liked it and i really like the vibe and the visuals i'm really i'm really trying to get uh yeah behind the lyrics the meaning of the lyrics because there were so many metaphorical symbolic stuff going on um especially with let the red something something get a red dream yeah let the red dream get inside you or something like this um infused with color all my grey decisions and uh all the all the symbolic visuals as well i i it really it really caught me somehow and i was really thinking about thinking of what they could mean by that so i have no idea we need to to read some theories yes we do but yeah um musically wise i would say uh it's it's quite enjoyable um the but i i have to say the the instruments are more in the foreground than the vocals what in my opinion was a little um yeah a little um sad kinda because i got the feeling that they really have that they all really have nice voices yeah especially those ad-libs right the ad-libs and the really high um high sun harmonies in the first or second chorus yeah uh so high and so so clean so clear so good um would be interesting i mean it's it's again kind of pressed into a direction where it is really a little bit compressed too much compressed again it's on the edge to too much compression and limiting okay um but yeah i mean in the k-pop universe we we get that a lot we now know that uh it's it's something um they kind of enjoy i think or they wanted to have it like that um but still not every k-pop uh a group or artist has it like that um but they tend to have it a little bit too over compressed and there are almost no dynamics anymore and you can distinguish really good distinguish the instruments and the vocals in a nice way i would say but it's it's a problem of modern music so um i wouldn't say it's a special problem with uh different or something uh similar so uh still i like the melodies uh the vocal harmonies and um yeah overall the arrangement yeah i think the melody of the hook is really catchy absolutely especially this side yeah right especially the the kind of chant stuff it's really some uh which yeah witchy voodoo stuff going here really wanna know the meaning yeah i really need to get behind it i really enjoyed the beginning um because often times i really like the beginning uh because you can it's it's it's the part where everything slowly begins and you can clearly hear yeah the instruments and especially the the you really get the vibe ins oftentimes and very instantly and uh you can hear the vocals very nice at least so um nice cards here see and that is something they have something they're not so poppy but more like it's it's mainstream it's it's pogba yeah absolutely because i feel like it's getting more to the neo soul yeah see that's the point you're right that's because you you got the keys the warm uh kind of road keys the piano keys and they can actually play some really nice chords here yeah you had maybe some seventh and ninth cards going here yeah that's the reason why but then it gets too much but not too much instrument wise it's only too much in compression i would say and then you or the song loses this vibe but it's still underneath the whole production but you can't hear it anymore just because of the mixing and the mastering i would say maybe there's one instrument too much just maybe but it's a it's it's it's a job or a thing of uh mixing because even if you have one instrument that isn't that much needed just by mixing it maybe a little bit uh quieter on or maybe on on one side or putting a lot of reverb on it and then it gets more in the background anyways uh is a good way to overcome that yeah issues pseudo pseudo problem let's call it like that because it's not a real problem problem i mean if you want to have this instrument in the production uh there is no right or wrong it's just about could it be too much for the listener to really get the the the whole concept of the song uh anymore so all right because also in the beginning was this was it the bass yeah and that's why i forgot about that see and that's the reason why i instantly like the song because it really got a real groovy funky vibe with a nice bass sound at the beginning and then it changed into something else i mean it's oh i want to eat an apple now to her eyes are you kidding me face and this kind of 80s uh synth guitar doing again [Music] also the drums have an absolutely 80s vibe as well those are the tom drums on the drum set pumps yeah with all the oh that's why it's really really really enjoyable um but then it gets a little bit yeah into some other direction i mean it's k-pop we know that they used to or yeah used to tend to to change up the the genres and everything but it's so smooth here um that you actually don't notice it in a obvious kind of way but that's also the reason why i'm actually not that sure if it was by intention or not so what do you think what do you think write it in the comments uh i would say we just discuss enough but i really enjoy the beginning it's uh super enjoyable it's it's very nice it actually it reminds me of a michael jackson song um but one post mortem um forgot the name it's it's uh from from the other not the first uh postmodern album but from the second one um something with um chains something something doesn't matter but just to get the the to get me to have this feeling or the reminiscence of the michael jackson song is just great awesome i mean michael jackson or his music was uh or still is a big influence for me uh and yeah for me doing music and producing music so nice very nice girls hi guys uh okay write in the comments if you enjoyed it uh and uh i i i really want to do a uh um style check side check side check we almost look like twins it's it's uh it's it's embarrassing almost uh ridiculous but do it tear up the shirts uh this actually is a one of the first temples so when you order them uh this logo is gonna be a little bit smaller and more on the side uh because i wasn't satisfied with that one it was a little bit too too big and the rest is uh uh um outfitter jeans dead jeans dad jeans from bdg her outfitters and my adidas adidas adidas and you got some bdg on as well right yes but it's the girlfriend jean but it's a little bit loose i think yeah a little bit you lost some weight you need to get the do you want me i didn't get my t-shirt boobie shot boobie can can you see it oh yeah they can can you see it oh yeah do they yeah i don't know if it's focused but yeah okay thank you guys thank you guys see you in the next one we're going to do something now something toughness this works perfectly wow you broke it thank you so much thank you oh we need an apple look at each other and have it happen in the middle in our hands will it work no i don't know if that's gonna work we're so stupid thank you so so much guys bye-bye and by the way i actually because um uh kanye missed to uh
