we in the hand ARRA don't want answers it's hard to avoid them but we try to facts I don't think I understand well we come here to the fastnesses mostly to learn what questions not to ask but your the answers you don't see kenri why we perfected and practiced foretelling no to exhibit the perfect uselessness of knowing the answer to the wrong question [Music] this season of extra sci-fi is brought below to check out all their videos free for 30 days he sits in a long hall cold despite the fire he's the first mobile the envoi to an uncontacted world this world is like his but unlike his they are a people of ritual and subtlety their customs are long-established so change in this world from at least his point of view is slow and yet it is his job to convince them to join the ecumene the confederation of humanoid worlds which he serves but it's more than their customs and their rituals he doesn't understand it's their very biology the people here are sexually androgynous and only for a few days out of every month do they take on a gender they go through phases of gender expression until they take on a male or a female aspect for procreation but even then their gender isn't fixed a person may be both a mother and a father during their lifetime they may swap what role they express each month not even having words for fixed gender and here he is about to meet their King a radio quietly plays it just told him that his one Ally his one supporter on this alien world has just been exiled for treason the left hand of Darkness is fundamentally a novel about isolation and exclusion but it's not about the isolation of space it's about the isolation of existing in a society you fundamentally don't understand and that very fundamentally doesn't understand you it challenges all of the tropes so tacitly accepted by the Golden Age writers it places a heterosexual male character in a world where he not only isn't dominant but where he's seen as a perversion where he's looked at with horror and disgust it does so as a metaphor as a lens that forces us to look at some of our preconceptions it forces us to consider what it means to be marginalized or worse reviled simply for who you are and it forces us to consider questions of gender and sexuality it's one of the standout works of a movement in sci-fi that came into being alongside the new wave a movement that came out of the women's movement of the 60s and 70s that looked at what was going on in the world especially in America and yearned to extrapolate forward to explore the idea of gender roles and to ask the question what would the world look like without them because while science fiction as a genre began with a female writer female voices had been largely absent from sci-fi until this period now though at last a group of women armed with the ideals of the 60s and 70s would begin to open the genre up taking home a number of Hugo and nebula Awards over the next decade and paving the way for people like Margaret Atwood and Octavia Butler to keep pushing the genre forward sometimes these early female authors are considered part of the new wave sometimes they're given a separate category like feminist science fiction but however you want to categorize them they were doing what Syfy does best asking big questions that make us rethink our society our beliefs and who we are and Ursula K Le Guin was uniquely positioned to ask those questions her parents were anthropologists they were perhaps best known for their friendship with and later books about a man who is often considered to have been the last Native American not to have real contact with Western settlers he died while Ursula was young but she was raised on stories of this man a man who had no name because there was no one left alive to name him she was raised on stories of a people seen as foreign or alien and thus driven to extinction by people who didn't understand them and famous academics and scientists like Robert Oppenheimer were frequent houseguests at her home through them from a very young age she was exposed to the cutting edge of science and the most radical ideas of the academic world even their dinner table conversation would later serve as fodder for her books but let's jump back into the left hand of darkness because it not only forced male readers and writers to see the human experience from another perspective it asked us to question the value of a fundamentally gendered society the main character I is tasked with bringing a new world into the Confederation of planets he belongs to but he starts the book with a very rigid way of thinking and part of the genius of this book is the evolution of his character he starts as the stereotypical male sci-fi protagonist you'd find in almost any piece of Golden Age five he's the man of a reason he sees the world through a lens of pure logic and is at a loss when other people don't view the world in the same way he believes in material prosperity and sees it as one of the benchmarks of success of a society so he's flabbergasted when he lays out all of the wonders of technology that the ecumene could offer the Geffen the world he's an envoy too and they're simply not interested he doesn't understand how others might see spiritual or cultural ideals as the benchmark of a society and this prevents him from being able to fulfill his mission yet over the course of his journey he slowly comes to shed some of what might have been called his traditionally masculine ideas opening up to a more emotive existence and becomes both a more effective envoi and a better rounded person because of it this book makes us asked if he hadn't grown up in a society divided by gender if he hadn't been inculcated with the ideas of how a man should think and how a man should act could much of the suffering in the story have been avoided it's a powerful book filled with questions that get right down to the core of who we are it doesn't ask that we approach it with an open mind but rather it hopes to open our minds as it goes and if we like the character I can get there it promises to leave us with a broader perspective and ready to explore the tradition of feminist and anthropological sci-fi that extends right down to today thanks again to credits you can future proof your decision and get your first month free [Music]
