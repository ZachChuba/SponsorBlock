taste my crucifix you go outside now uh let's see all right light it again i'm still trapped i don't know if i can light it can you fill it with oil yeah i'd need to fill the oil back up oh we're [ __ ] what was that i heard a squelch was that the noise are you trying to open the door no is that something opening there's a squelch that unlocked just now oh what's making that noise oh look down through the grating oh my god oh that's sick okay then we're back oh look it's that's what i look like oh maybe that's gonna be the point is it's gonna show the monster and it's gonna be a regular looking dude and it's gonna be like see you were the scary one are you gonna clean up your [ __ ] crud again oh it's it's really coming down outside oh can't forget me old cross i don't even know if that does anything yet i don't either honestly it just makes me feel better why you're not even christian yeah but but you first made this game is likely to be yeah you got to follow other people's beliefs okay i guess when in rome right yeah you'd crucify the guy that's what that refers to right when in rome i mean yes murder jesus that's clever oh [ __ ] i heard a scary monster did you thought i did go outside and say hello to it jesus be with me jesus oh this [ __ ] sucks that's what you gotta you gotta say jesus please let's come and help oh help me save pilot little whelp you know what's good for big piles of dirt big big shovels yeah let's go get that big shovel big big shovel oh look another pile of dirt oh oh there was a woman on her period here that's just a dead pigeon oh okay i totally read that shape wrong that was a [ __ ] like a maxi pad yeah well not everything's a delicious bun let's go dig up the one in the backyard wait you see the lighthouse right there it looks like it looks like it looks like it looks like don't say it looks like my fine say it oh there's nothing in my backyard dildo dildo looks like the little dildo i use up my [ __ ] oh you're that one you use that little one you're always showing off the one you're always bringing to parties for some reason the platinum [ __ ] glass ass dildo oh [ __ ] oh look another coin well whatever the little grub on it oh were those the same seagulls that inconvenienced your sandbag holders earlier i'd like to believe they are yeah good they got what was coming to him this thing's helping you're gonna go right back to your house and put that on your chest yeah i'm gonna put it on my big hairy chest oh tomorrow you'll be maggot man oh you still gotta get one more see i'm already so close yet so far all right there's got to be more [ __ ] to dig up because i still haven't found the key to the lighthouse do you have to find that every day i mean usually it's someplace easy but yeah today i have no way in [Music] and how am i supposed to protect the ships from this horrible [ __ ] weather if i can't get into the dang lighthouse he has a point low that's true wait what what the [ __ ] what was that [ __ ] radio voice if it was a [ __ ] weird crap what the [ __ ] radio crap it ain't what it used to be ain't what it used to be ain't what it used to be oh my god it's coming at you and blasting dumpsters whatever building i go to i'm gonna have a shitty angle on the entrance oh he's getting close yeah i need to like dodge left and right more oh i don't know if that helps yeah it didn't really look like it yeah serpentine it's it's not a sniper it's a a crab a bug a centipede oh [ __ ] where the [ __ ] the entrance gets it really seemed like he was going to get you there okay i think i want to go back to where he just chased me from though i'm pretty sure he was guarding something uh i wish this game had like sliding around your ass physics you know that would make truly a better game and if it was like 2d instead of 3d and if it had like really good graphics rather than really bad graphics and you're mean this is supposed to this is all purpose i love the graphics of this yeah it's really nicely made so wait you said that this was inspired by the lighthouse yeah how fast did they make this game then i mean lighthouse came out in 2019 and i do think this this was like made pretty quickly it's not that long of a game it's still pretty impressive yeah here we go like if if you can crank something out in a year just just like a finished product i think that's pretty cool i'd be proud if i made this oh they buried both of your things there or you buried both your whatever either you went into a fugue state and buried your [ __ ] though can't remember which way i even came from the rain just got worse oh there's the lighthouse there you go you're on track good thing my lantern is invulnerable to water the ps1 horror aesthetic is so good it's better to make a game that's functional and like vague rather than something that's photo realistic and like barely functions and doesn't you know and most photo realistic stuff comes off uncanny no matter what anyway oh that's it again are you [ __ ] kidding me what is i think that little whaling didn't that make that exact same noise before i got chased last time did it well you're inside already so yeah i'm good i think i'm good uh oh yeah i guess i gotta fill up my can oh what the [ __ ] i guess this was just lightning but it was scary sounding sound like a growl and that's a sound like to me too and then the storm goes totally silent seriously [Music] that's such good acoustics that floor wasn't black before was it is that a um thing it might be more goo what the [ __ ] fella off the lighthouse the first time you looked at that window i don't know for all i know it was just like a pigeon but or a seagull i mean yeah it it looked like guy shaped vaguely like it was it was like it could have been a bird it could have been like the body of the last dude it's it clearly was not like a crab or something whenever the [ __ ] chasing you it wasn't that but whatever's [ __ ] with you is clearly intelligent at least to some degree because it's cutting your ropes and [ __ ] which is kind of funny you got to admit that's lols [Applause] dude a crab with thoughts i would kill it i would hate that yeah i don't like crabs any like bug that could walk upright and think yeah you can't see [ __ ] up here yeah the view sucks whose idea was it to work here oh made me do this i guess just uh go back to bed and just think about your beloved wife and all that stuff wait oh it stopped moving wait really i gotta crank it all over again what happened if this thing did it again should i put on some beautiful music from our little grandma phone i think so you could all right i'm gonna do it there you go i think that undoes the cranking when you come up here i don't know i mean it's still spinning oh i think you're done here then i think it wants you to go back down okay can i watch the i want to watch the lighthouse that i won't even let me oh wait there we go oh oh it just went dark it did just go [ __ ] well now i need to get more oil are you sure it's not like glitching right now [Music] that always sounds like a scary monster it sure does oh okay was that puddle there before i don't know i don't think it was i think that's new goo my friend you want to go down to the goose the goo hole it was locked still i checked it uh mother goose can't let you in nope no mother goose making a comeback mother guzman lose all my cousin oh please don't die tomorrow i'm trying don't die oh if you die or scream alright can i leave now yeah no i guess it wants me to go out here why i don't know dude this rain is moth armor you're safe still can't see [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] turned off again yeah what's going on is this all part of the spook i think so this thing is like guzzling your [ __ ] oil i know right it was never a problem before oh is that what the ink is is just taking your oil and [ __ ] smearing it around the walls like an [ __ ] maybe i don't know if it's that i mean maybe it is crude oil like that that would have sucked have to clean off then like if it's some kind of squid crab that eats gasoline and then uses it to poop oil i'd be pretty mad at it not gonna lie oh whoa they're missing oh [ __ ] he took it down to his little shitty cellar oh great you need to kick this thing's ass what the [ __ ] are you gonna do take my lantern out oh [ __ ] it won't let me use anything but the [ __ ] oil can oh [ __ ] oh man oh [ __ ] can you grab oil now they're gonna have to come down here for your oil dude that's so stupid why do you take your oil dude he's being a dick yeah i'm not a fan of this [ __ ] thing like more more than like trying to kill you this thing is just [ __ ] with you sure is like it's pranking you if this is like a [ __ ] baboon what was that edgar allan poe thing where it was like the killer was an orangutan and that was the whole thing i don't remember it was like this whole thing where it was like this big air of mystery and then it was just a monkey she didn't sound like a monkey in there that's a pretty good ending honestly tomer weren't you talking about a show that had an ending where it turns out the entire show was like this well-crafted story but it turns out the last episode and they just say it's like an autistic kid playing with a snow globe yeah that's sane elsewhere that's the funniest [ __ ] i ever heard they had this entire show like and it was like a hospital yeah it's a hospital drama and in the final episode it turns out it was all in the brain of an autistic child playing with a snow globe and his dad is just like i wonder what goes on inside that old head of his i don't understand this autism thing it's just it's the funniest ending ever and people were really invested in it oh oh oh the autistic kids on the roof with a snow globe again [ __ ] did you fall through he didn't break your goddamn house did he look up dick talk oh it's fine in here oh there's my lighthouse key at least the chest moved i think there's a picture of the virgin mary or something up there what to do pretty sure that wasn't there before although i could be wrong yeah actually i don't remember you might want to get your crucifix whoa it made a [ __ ] mess it sure did why the hell would he do that oh was that implied that oh no i guess it broke the roof and dropped a bird through yeah when you saw the thing moving it like went through the roof and it like went out to the hallway toward the other side of the house before the crash like it just was climbing climbing across to there okay so it probably just stuck its foot through the roof or something why is there just one dead bird here though it's saying you're gonna be the bird someday well i gotta clean this mess up gonna clean up by this mess i specifically just mean that one puddle because i can't pick up anything else god well i guess i gotta repair my house and now it's real foggy out oh sure is huh and real quiet all the ambience is gone what do you call that oh what's that some planks of wood some nails a hammer and a ladder or you can just put the ladder in your inventory yeah at least we know this guy has really deep pockets if he gets into trouble tomorrow when that thing runs after you make him run under the ladder and then he'll like fall off the cliff [ __ ] that sounds like him hope he don't come [Laughter] all right let's fix this stupid roof through mindless repetitive tasks is it going to be like that no it's pretty intuitive yeah and now we go put nails in and now we got to put nails in oh it doesn't like the nails don't like the nails not happy about the nails that's kind of satisfying okay let's pound them in boys use the cross you think i can use the cross that might upset mother sweet mother mary downstairs that didn't work what hammering things and would you think that the power of religion would make you hammer faster i don't know maybe it would just be like a clever easter egg that you could hammer it in with the cross oh just got a little darker no more fog that'd be a good like revenge story coming full circle you know after the nails go into the cross all the time the cross is used to hammer the nails oh look i knew that bird took that key a little key what a bastard i still don't have the little a little fourth thing though do i nope well [ __ ] that's probably what it wants you to go find right now i guess well i think that was the lighthouse key we just got so time to go to the lighthouse yay don't do that i'm sorry it's already playing the music should i check in here go get some freaking oil oh he put him back that's nice of him oh it's open what do you think go look for it go look for it go look for it go look for it [ __ ] yes oh that's empty again i would never go down into this great room not even if you know what are these [ __ ] textures like they're they [ __ ] warp when you that actually hurts my eyes yeah that's a that's a unity trick that people use for these games they try to make it look like the z buffer [ __ ] up in the ps1 and it works it looks good oh no i wouldn't go we're basically we're at the beginning of the game again i think oh is this are you the same guy i don't know if i'm i don't think so but it seems like the same thing's happening to us that happened to him that record player needs to just go in the ocean off all right oh it's spinning so good dude if i bought this lighthouse i'd be really sad yeah i'd be pissed too it's homo there's a tip like the lighthouse dude i'll give you that one for free now what i guess i'll take a stroll along the balcony look at the moon please that thing's gonna bounce up from the beginning of the game boing i was just getting ready to bounce i i really you know what if i want to criticize this game for one thing i wish that every time you came out into these different little areas i wish there was one new tiny little creepy thing going on but hey that's just me oh my god what is that is that the thing man i think it's a mothman [ __ ] christ oh it goofs the door oh god that's a really good moment wait did that work
