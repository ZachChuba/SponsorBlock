the Gregorian calendars cruelest trick is placing the new year right in the dead center of winter the time of year that you're most likely to feel motivated to eat healthy foods also coincides with most of the best produce being about as in season as ginkgos at Fashion Week around this time of year the only seasonal foods seem to be rich indulgences meant to serve as hibernation fuel so fight back against the comestibles realm that is winter by roasting squash gather and slice one or a small variety of Honey Nut delicata or acorn squash maybe even a couple sweet potatoes these are all tender skin vegetables that don't need to be peeled but you could just as well use an armor-plated butternut and skin it first toss these around with enough sesame oil to barely coat everything and arrange them on a big sheet pan these can roast at 450 Fahrenheit for 30 minutes with a flip and turn half way through why all those roasts I will make a pretty easy glaze so just combine equal parts melted or softened butter white miso and maple syrup I'll call this about two tablespoons each if you make too much you could always drizzle the excess on to the finished dish before serving or reserve it and use it for maple miso roasted salmon some other day I know I started this lesson with a message of health and you'd be right to notice that a glaze made mostly out of butter and syrup isn't exactly a celery stick I justify the indiscretion by acknowledging that a thin shellacking is all each piece needs but you can apply as much or as little as you care to it but if you're really going to skimp on the glaze add some extra miso first this fermented soy paste is the only contributor of salinity since those squash pieces are unsalted so if you stick with equal parts of each glazed component and don't use much of it you'll find the final fish lacking its so these have been going for about 15 minutes on each side and they have a good amount of color on them the last step is to brush on some glaze and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes please keep in mind that maple syrup is sugar and sugar burns quickly so keep an eye out you can garnish these with sesame seeds and slivered green onions and then they're done enjoy them at any point of the indulgences spectrum be there as a side for fatty braised meats or as the sweet fortification of a shredded kale salad with goat cheese pecans and pumpkin seeds roasting a big batch of squash gives you larger fodder for days so even though the new year new me honeymoon month has come to a close you'll have ready-to-eat veggie fuel for whatever you do whether it's exercise loafing around or making the shortest video that you can just in time to avoid fading into obscurity for one more month it's got a blast
