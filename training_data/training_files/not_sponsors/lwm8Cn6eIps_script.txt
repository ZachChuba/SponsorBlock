welcome back to another video that explores botting activity in old school runescape we have a lot of interesting bots to cover today so leave a like and make sure to subscribe if you haven't already back in the day one of the biggest draws of runescape to me was the grand exchange there were whole clans set up to talk about flipping items the grand exchange is the stock market of earn skit if you have some patience in starting gold it's one of the best money makers there is nowadays on the new york stock exchange for example there are highly advanced artificial intelligence scripts day trading and these are the first bots we're going to talk about today the bots behind the grand exchange in runescape now i know most of you guys remember the days even in old school runescape's history before the grand exchange this was a great time for merchbots because people were totally willing to pay more or less for their items if they were buying and selling them because it could be so time consuming to buy and sell stuff and if you were looking for these bots it was usually pretty easy to find them you could try to trick them into trading you other stuff or just try to lure them away but that's definitely not the case anymore now these bots are sitting behind the screens under a stack of players at the grand exchange this footage was sent to me of one of the many merchant bots out there the first thing i thought when i saw this footage was that the bots are going for highly traded items which is why they look so active i mean this bot is trading once every three to five minutes i was told the longer the bot runs the more gp per hour it makes because it logs off and when it logs back in it'll make a lot of money off of its flips but this seems like a risky business i have no idea what the ban rates are like i would guess they're low but jagex definitely could detect some stuff like this and if you want to make a decent rate of gp per hour using this you have to risk a lot of gp on the grand exchange just from looking at conversations on the forums from botting websites a lot of people are saying that you need at least 100 mil gp starting cash i mean this guy right here is posting that he starts with a 300 mil cash stack i'll get into how this works servpugger to find out how you can get three months for free the amount of money made from these bots is kind of up for debate some scripts say you should get roughly one percent of the gp you're using per hour another guy says he got eight to twelve percent of his cash stack also really depends on how much gp they're using the more they use the less roi you should expect because if you're flipping with one bill you're not going to expect 100 mil back every hour but how do these all work all the bots i've seen use the os buddy ge api basically os buddy logs all the ge transactions from its users to give accurate real-time price data the merch bots are fed this data and can automatically see what items are being bought and sold for so they can undercut the margin and profit incredibly efficiently many of these bots are fed lists of hundreds of items when the script starts and can test and choose the items with higher margins on that list i even noticed in this footage if items aren't buying or selling for a while the scripts adjust price accordingly so in the background of this footage the algorithm is constantly checking the real-time price of the items it's flipping and can clearly see the margin on all the items fed into the script so the next time you go to the ge and just want to sell things quickly and hit five percent down there's a high chance there's a bot profiting one screenshot i found for example has a point zero four percent minimum profit margin for each item to prevent the chance of loss due to undercutting of other merchers now some bots actually have a high scores for their users that ranks the progression of the users now remember you do have to take this with a grain of salt because lots of bottles do want their scripts to seem more successful than they are but based on the run time this high scores looks relatively accurate it's not like they're claiming to make a billion gp in a few weeks i'm also guessing this counts the same user botting on multiple accounts but if you look at some of the top run times you've got 2 700 days 5 700 days and the profits at the top are like 40 billion gp 20 billion gp really the way for that to be possible is this script was kept on the download for a long time so i'm guessing only the few users at the very top of this list had access to it for a long time so there's usually a time period before a script is mass banned jagex does a great job of comparing accounts actions so when lots of accounts start using the same script the script itself gets flagged and all of the accounts are wiped out the only way you really see numbers like this is when the script is kept private for a while and used heavily by only a couple people so that it doesn't get mass flagged the person who sent me this footage also sent me this screenshot at the end of each bot session it actually prints out a full list of all the items it bought and sold scripters can see the profitability of each item which informs how they run the script the next time a bottlers try to get creative to transfer that gp one way is to find items that aren't traded on the grand exchange almost ever which means if you're trying to sell that item and buy it you can really set the price so for example i was able to sell one iron javelin for 40k and i had my other account buying that javelin for 40k so the 40k was basically transferred through the grand exchange to my other account think if you spent an hour making iron javelins you could transfer a couple thousand of them for a hundred mil gp it's becoming more and more common these days for real world traders and bottas to transfer gold to each other's accounts like that i never thought i'd see the day where bots are stealing from other bots but in a video the last few months i was talking about how free to play bots due to trade restrictions have to launder the gp somehow one of the ways the bots were doing that is by buying and selling wines of zamarak in general stores because they go for one gp each in the general store but they're over 1k on the grand exchange well they started up again after i made that video this guy decided it was some of the freest gp he had seen so he made a very basic bot that just bought wines of zamarak from the general store in falador as you can see here there are lots of free to play accounts selling the wines to each other in the store he said they would pop up in packets of 10 to 20 accounts he only ran the bot on two free-to-play accounts as you can see in the footage and he only had to run the bots for nine hours before the bot farm realized they were losing a ton of money so in just nine hours from two free-to-play accounts he made 30 million gp from wines of zamarak that's almost 2 ml gp per hour per account he said his bots basically bought the wines of zamarak instantly when they came into the shop so there wasn't really any competition okay botting is always against the rules and cheating and bad but this is the least worst kind of botting for sure i love it when you guys go out and actually scout bots for yourselves and send them back to me it's super interesting to see what you guys find a guy named crankin was doing demonic gorillas and noticed a pattern in the gear and the way players were moving around him they were getting hit by rocks constantly and trying to pj the demonic gorillas he was killing the gear is super recognizable because it's basically identical whoever's running this bob farm should have maybe switched it up a little bit watch out for the obsidian plate legs dragon boots blow pipe whip and one of the blessed dragon hide bodies with ava's accumulator as well if you look at the amount traded of zenites on the highest scores too it looks like there are some really significant peaks going on on random days i'm not 100 sure what it's from but it could be the bots dumping them i got another tip about bots that seem to be playing pest control to create void rangers probably to sell well-built pecan accounts go for a lot of money on the black market the ones i found in game i'm not completely sure if they're bots or just account farmers the three of them and i were the only ones left in the boat during the start of one of the games and they all quickly left the game it could be a broken bot where they may have seen me scrying them who knows but their stats are very clearly training up for a void ranger account bill there have been a lot of sightings of similar accounts hanging out where dragon implants commonly spawn and you can actually kill them using the giant tortoises this group i found i had usernames that all had something like i won't range in them with some random stats in 83 hunter for the dragon implants also i'm not 100 sure on this but i've gotten so many tip-offs and i've seen some reddit posts about this where their accounts at the ge spamming item names and numbers my best guess is that they are merch bots and they're broken so the interface isn't open but if you guys have any other theories let me know i really wonder how many merch bots are out there and how much wealth they're throwing around in the grand exchange to profit i'm sure legit merchant would be much more profitable without these bots out there since the bots get fed the data literally instantly as prices update in the os buddy ge api they can obviously react a lot quicker than regular mergers anyway tell me what you guys think of the comments and leave a like on the video i'll see you guys next time
