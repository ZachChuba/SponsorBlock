I ask Minnie. This is the most vicious OX quiz in the world. Listen to the question and answer it in three seconds. Q. My voice is like a treasure. Q. I get sulky easily. What??
(Sulky!) ..............Why? Q. I speak Korean best among the foreign members of IDLE. Really?? Q. I'm the best at whistling among idols. You said your voice is like a treasure. Why? Because I'm in charge of charming voices in (G)I-DLE. Therefore, I must be confident! What do you think your voice is out of 100? It will depend on your taste.... 80 points....? The point is too low. I still have to try harder. I will be able to give higher scores later on. I still have a long way to go. You are famous for being a fan of singer Troy Sivan. What is your favorite Troy Sivan song? (I knew that!) Our treasure!!! Please send a video letter to Troy Sivan that you want to perform a collaboration. You are writing and composing with So Yeon. You made the songs 'For you' and 'Blow your mind'. Sudden Question! Q. I hope the song I made becomes the title song of (G)I-DLE. Of course it would be good. But it's going to be a lot of pressure... Do you have a Korean version of 'For You'? Originally, this song was made with Korean lyrics. Wow~ This is the first time on the idol ground! Minnie's surprise gift for Neverland. We hope it'll be on (G)I-DLE's album someday. You said you don't get sulky easily, right? However, the members' reactions were quite different. Only Mi Yeon!!! You're the only one who doesn't know. You don't know~ All right. Next. I saw what Soo Jin said in one video. "Minnie gets more sulky as she gets older" I remember~ I was with Mi Yeon at the time. All events begin with her! I heard that you and Mi Yeon are called "Cute Sisters", right? Yes, we are~! But recently Mi Yeon made a bombshell. "She is not my favorite member anymore!" Did you hear that? Yes, I did.... How do you feel? I was a little surprised. Because.... I didn't even know I'm her favorite member. I don't have any affection... left for you.... Well... I don't care~~ Who is your favorite member? All of them~~~~ Send a video letter to Miyeon. To. Mi Yeon who no longer like me..... Actually, I didn't even know you liked me. But... Thank you for liking me. I'm not sad that you don't like me anymore. Thank you~ I love you~~~~ We love each other~~~~~ I heard that you are full of charms, right? Is it true? I don't know.... (Not anymore....) I don't know.... Let's go back to you, who used to be full of charms. (OMG) Show me Kim Minnie's cute act! I've never done that..... She is so cute~~~ What is her favorite Korean word? Why did she jump up? To be continue~
