now I'm not saying you shouldn't open this but you remember that scene for Raiders of the Lost Ark that's the first one right I think I've seen poor you mean that's the first one why don't we get on with this this is the Dukey I think it's due gee I don't care s90 the modular phone that claims to actually matter will it let's see and glass doors check it out today at the link in the video description [Music] so somehow on a phone this size they still didn't manage to include a headphone jack how does that even happen I actually think they get a pass really yes because this is a rugged phone this phone is ip68 rated it's also ip69k o rated so that's the like high temperature like I press ties although what you're doing with your phone where you need to put it under a high pressure spray to clean it I mean foreign directors Ebola crisis response team okay who knows and then drop-wise how are we doing on this thing I don't think there's actually any drop numbers per se but they do advertise military-grade durability with its ballistic proof and salt corrosion spray proof and mold proof so feature-wise this thing actually has like kind of pretty much everything it's got a five thousand milliamp hour battery 5050 sorry excuse me it's got a 16 megapixel rear camera eight megapixel front camera it's got microSD expansion it's got an eight core Helio P 60 processor six gigs of RAM 128 gigs of storage dual SIM support it's got whatever this is what this isn't oh the sims in there that's a waterproof thing it's the only thing that's missing is the headphone jack really though the thing that attracted us to it is this accessory package so included with the phone you've got what appears to be an antenna you've got okay that's just a regular type C cable this one's pretty cool this is just a Type C 2 type 8 it comes with that so you can plug in pretty much any USB device you'd like it's got this wall wart that we're gonna have to use a different one because that's incompatible it's got whatever this is oh my god is that what this is yes is there a walkie-talkie it's a walkie-talkie that's pretty cool okay we're gonna have to try that later gravy inter what is a great inter that reads 86 and we're definitely dude you're not even 90 I am 90 go I'm not moving at all go check broken sound Peter alright guys so welcome to Linus tech tips I'm going to be checking out the new ps90 it's reading annoying boss you did that right in my ear put this back on here yeah I think you can throw it I think it's fine yeah that's the idea right Oh [Music] Oh Doogie Oh Doogie [Music] [Applause] yeah so I think it's pretty fair to say that in spite of our abuse this thing doesn't even have a scratch on it well we were lucky that we didn't throw with any accessories on it because these accessories are not rugged at all or waterproof okay so they just clip on in there and I mean it stayed on hey I think it was trying to give us instructions the accessories can cause significant errors and compass applications connecting OTG when back clip powers connected neither will be available oh so basically they have just rerouted the USB type-c interface here that's a sweet interface though boom what the hell is water camera the interface does not support touch function press volume up and photo key to capture well that makes sense when you're underwater and you can't tap it yeah so you use the buttons this is not an amazing camera so this is the rear camera the autofocus is abominable like it keeps grabbing you and then just completely losing you it's a Samsung camera it's gonna have a really hard time with that this thing it struggles at the best of times okay give me your best action hero pose yeah this is really not a strong performance should we see I think that walkie-talkie working no I think we should move on alright cuz no one's gonna buy that people are gonna buy this the battery wanted an extra five thousand milliamp hours this doesn't feel like 5,000 milliamp hours I bet it does when it's on there and you still can't use OTG that's pretty annoying and you also lose your fingerprint reader it's covered now this thing is really unwieldly like compared to the 13,000 milliamp hour EULA phone that we checked out recently this feels so much more ungainly like if you're gonna have a big phone it is so much more space and weight efficient to just have a bigger battery in the phone in the first place versus trying to clip on an accessory this is why I think three modular phone concept up until now has failed now one thing Doogie is doing a little bit differently is they're trying to build accessories that someone might actually want and this night vision one is really the most unique one you know what I think people would think it just looks like one of those pop-up things what are those calls all those those pop rings it looks like you got a camera themed one you know like you can get those coffee months that look like lenses like I work in film so I got one of these lens yeah so it works in the day there's a lot of noise a lot of green here hmm I don't think this is night vision at all I think this is just a big lens that captures more light like yes in a very dark situation I could hold this up in front of me and like kind of be able to see but with the same amount of preparation I could grab a flashlight you know I mean honestly the phone itself I don't really have any particular issue with if you want a rugged phone there aren't a ton of options out there there's those underpowered ones from cat there's that EULA phone that we checked out recently but that is not waterproof even though it's got like a really kind of beefy rugged ish feeling build so I mean I pay I'd say three hundred and fifty bucks four hundred bucks is fair when the Kickstarter ends it's gonna be three hundred seven US dollars to house wireless charging too doesn't it yes it has Wireless char except that if you go and put an accessory on it you lose it correct so there's a couple things we missed there's a game module that's like a game controller or something like that and then apparently the modules kind of aren't that amazing right now but they could make more in the future like the 5d one so this could extend the lifetime of this device right well it's the same issue we run into with every modular phone where that assumes that they sell enough of these things and the modules to fund the development of future modules which is something that to my knowledge simply has not happened yet those of you rocking the moto Z force you know rock on baby power to you if it makes you happy to have a rugged phone at a decent price that's kind of unwieldly in the hand you're trying to stand it up at about 87 degrees that we try to do there then go for it otherwise get a pixel of night sight a slash ltte we're gonna have that linked below so thanks for watching guys if you
