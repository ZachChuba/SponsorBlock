platform to build a beautiful online presence people are shocked appalled even that Hollywood is gross it's like every single day we get word that another Hollywood elite has a dark side and look I don't want what I'm about to say to be misconstrued because obviously it's good that these people are being called out okay but I do have a question didn't we already know that Hollywood was terrible okay it's really good that people are talking about this now but III don't know I guess I grew up assuming that everything in Hollywood was terrible like that was that was a given and maybe it's because I'm from the Bible Belt but I don't know none of this really feels like breaking news to me we grew up being told that Hollywood was evil the sin and debauchery that goes on in that town I can't even speak of it so is that a no - Shrek - then so uh good job Christians you got one right but I'm honestly asking because this kind of feels like when Edward Snowden that guy kind of you know found all the details that the government was spying on people and everyone was like no speak and I'm just over here like what didn't we already know this like I used to feel kind of sheltered but I feel like maybe I was a lot more prepared for the world than than you were hey Dad I was wondering how do you get to be famous what do you mean son like how do you get to be in the movies are you sure you want to know this son there's no going back yes all right I was hoping you'd be a little older but here goes [Music] you so it's good that people are finally mad about all this stuff but I guess what I'm trying to figure out is what changed like are people just now realizing that this is happening even though the information has been out there for decades or are we all mad about something that we already know I guess what I'm really asking is did people actually think that the people who made these movies were actually good people I don't really see that many movies honestly but when I do you know go out and spend 15 bucks on a movie it's despite the fact that I know that these are horrible if not criminal people making them like I watched Pirates of the Caribbean and I just try to block from my mind what a creepy person Johnny Depp is and I'm not saying that's right I just thought that's what we were all doing [Music] welcome back to really great Hollywood the show where we worship really great people we're joined tonight by a really great actor Jimmy doop Jimmy when you act in a movie you are really great thank you I mean sure you beat your wife abuse drugs and her in general a terrifying person but when you act in a movie you are really great I mean we all have our faults thank you I mean maybe people actually thought that these were decent kind-hearted individuals making these movies no these are the one-percenters you hate so much these are gross terrible people who are used to getting their way because they're rich it can make people famous hello there what can I interest you in today well I'm a Hollywood executive just got my first big break in Hollywood and I wanted to come down to Hollywood furniture oh great well this is the perfect location we have plenty of cats I'm not interested in this okay I'm not one of those monsters if that's what you're thinking well that's all he sell here so why'd you come oh no I just wanted to take a look around a little bit mm-hmm look I know I'm generalizing and then you know out there somewhere is a nice director who treats everybody perfectly okay just look at Dick Van Dyke he wasn't a director but he was a nice guy I think hopefully but it's sort of like politics there's only a few slots at the top and in order to get there you have to play the game I mean when you go to the movies and you see some of the demented stuff that they come up with and you got it fake who thought of this and who liked the ideas so much that they spent literal years of their life getting it onto the silver screen for eating you and your children to watch oh yeah whoever made this film seems like a really pleasant person don't they seem pleasant to you don't look up to these people okay even the ones you really want to believe are good people they may be but they're probably not the hard truth is Hollywood is a gross place that makes great movies kind of like how McDonald's sells salads you can either sleep at night knowing this or you can't and even though it's being called out now it's not going to change Hollywood has been this way for a hundred years just like Hollywood movies it's always gonna be the same story and maybe just you know told a different way next time stay tuned guys back in the you the sin and to retire I was like don't they seem pleasant to you [Music]
