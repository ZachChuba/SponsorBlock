[Music] a lie okay next tutorial this time I meant to be dressed up as my take on a horror classic Frankenstein's monster or rather my take on him it's a super super simple makeup with the exception of the forehead but I really wanted to keep it as basic as I could and in want to overcomplicate this one that's not to mess with a classic this video is incredibly incredibly special to me as not only if I wanted to do this character for a very very long time it's also sponsored by one of my for sponsoring this video so if you'd back then how to recreate this Monster Mash madness stay tuned so we get this ball rolling by popping on a plain latex ball cap and blocking out your eyebrows these two steps are fairly important to this look so pop two links on the screen right here that will take you to two videos that I did in the past the teach you guys how to do both those things I'll also pop those links in the description bar below just so I don't have to teach you how to do it in this video's makings go a little bit quicker so we'll do both of those things and we'll continue on from there there we go so after I applied my ball cap I'm blocked out my eyebrows I went around the edge of my ball cap with free laser liquid latex just to get rid of edge so whilst that's trying I'm gonna talk to you about the headpiece I've made so this is really crude so bear with me it's just nice every now and again to do something that's proper out of the kit so in order to get the head shape right which is fairly higher and flat on top I made this really really basic headpiece which is kind of like a cap basically but yeah boom big reveal as I said it's quite crude as you can see it's completely made out of cardboard what I did was I measured the circumference of my head made a cardboard ring and then pop the top on it yeah so for now it looks quite rough around the edges but when I apply and covering latex hopefully a little better so the idea with this is I'm gonna pop it onto my head and then I just need to work on blending the edge so to blend that edge I'm going to take some regular masking tape and I'm gonna apply that to the edge of the car ball going all the way around and the brilliant thing about masking tape is it sticks really really well to latex so I working maybe one to two inches of strips going all the way along and when it's completely stuck down I can code that in some latex [Music] so once you're happy that it's all stuck down and let's take some more liquid latex and a sponge and with that I'm going to cover the entire cardboard surface in sides and the edge wherever I've gone with the masking tape I'm also going to be going over my forehead and my brows because I'll be building that up later please note that if you do go over your eyebrows with latex make sure when you block your eyebrows that with spirit gum wax you also do an extra layer of spirit gum just to make it extra safe so I'm gonna do all that for about four coats so then I'm going to work on building this area up and making generally more smooth so to do that I've got some regular tissue paper that I've separated so I've got the finished strips to work with I'm working in strips no bigger than this I can take some more liquid latex apply it in the area that I want it to be which in this case is going to be most of the head shape then I can stick that tissue down and then cover that in some more latex so by doing that it builds up the area and just makes it a lot smoother so I'll do that the entire head it doesn't matter too much on top because at the end of this makeup there's gonna be fake hair so it's not too much of an issue and I will be working on the brow as well but I'll do that after I smooth this whole area out so this whole area here is going to take about three to four layers of tissue just make sure to lay dry in between each layer before you build it up next otherwise it'll take a very long time to dry [Music] then I can move on to my brows someone take some more liquid latex and start coaching this whole area here so I'm gonna have a very very very stern straight across brow it's not gonna be particularly angry or sad looking is just mostly very stern so I need to make this quite a thick heavy brow so I'm going to cover this entire area then I can take some more tissue which I can separate once again so it's even smaller strips I can start building up this entire area yeah so in the same way that I've covered around the rest of this headpiece I'm gonna cut the tissue all the way along and just make sure it's a very very heavy heavy straight-across brow this is probably going to take about six coats of tissue and latex so be super patient and it dry in between and just make sure the main goal this isn't to make an angry brow it's just to make it look very neutral just very stern so once you're done enough layers it should look something like this then I can work on the foundation which will cover pretty much everything so the color I'm gonna use to that is gonna be a matte chromic a color in true chartreuse so it's a good rule of thumb to start of a light shade with this makeup and then you can always darken it up afterwards I should point out I mean Frankenstein's monster wasn't initially intended to be green as far as I'm aware I think the original idea was meant to be something like a dead fleshy tone something on those lines but somewhere along the way the tradition become to turn Frankenstein's monster green so next one I'm gonna go for something that it's more University recognized as so I'm gonna use this to paint the entire head and my face and my ears I want to leave my neck and to last [Music] then I'm gonna take another Matt krohmer cake color this one is in landscape green and with that I can apply it to the sides of my face going around where my temples would be much higher obviously and then going around for my cheekbones I can then just blend that out it doesn't matter too much how accurate this is at this point that you just get another base foundation shade right so then taking my trusty matte black paint stick which is a really nice dark cream I can start working on all of the detail of the face so the nasolabial folds and the contouring of the cheeks yeah so I'm going to start in the middle of the face and work outwards and I can blend it out afterwards then I can blend the nasolabial fold on the side of the nose completely outwards and to do that I'm gonna be using a makeup forever flash palette I'm gonna be using this really nice green from that so mixing that in lightly with the black as I blend it out should hopefully match the tone of the makeup then I can blend the area around the mouth and the chin downwards then using the black cream again I can move on to the next lines which is gonna be the really high but really really masculine and really carved cheekbones so again I'm just gonna trace the shape and blend it out afterwards so as you can see it goes across slight curve but then down so then I'm just gonna blend this color outwards with the majority of the color being faded downwards [Music] so yeah a very gone looking very harsh so then I'm gonna move on to the eyes doing the same thing again I'm gonna use the black cream by Mac and I'm gonna mix in that makeup for evergreen after I've applied the black just to get that hint of green in there so when I cover this area I'm gonna make sure I don't go above this hooded brow because otherwise ruin the illusion that it's so far forward and the shape is gonna be very pointed downwards because that's gonna create the eye bag underneath so yeah then I can blend the edges of the eyes in towards the middle so there's kind of like a unibrow effect basically it just makes this one long Stern brow song and I blend this black towards the middle and then downwards then I'm gonna start moving up a little bit and I'm going to do the same effect that I did on the cheekbones with the temples so yeah dimples then with a black cream again I'm gonna do one or two maybe three forehead furrows then I can just blend those lines all upwards [Music] then with the lips I can take the black cream and a really fluffy brush and I could just dab that in the middle of lips and blend outwards then I'm just gonna score that color outwards all the way around the lips so on the bottom half I'll be scoring downwards on a top half will be scoring it upwards so then I'm gonna work on some little bolts on top of the head so initially I was gonna paint them by four to make them a bit more free dimensional I think I'll make some so I've just made these little tiny tiny shiny bolts I just made them by like stacking cardboard and cut them out and spray painting them with a metallic spray paint and I've got four of those and I'm gonna stick them down with pro stick going along the top of my heads don't worry about them being hidden by the hair because the hair is gonna be very sparse when I apply that so once those will stuck down and nice and dry I'm gonna apply some fake hair so rather than using crepe X I think there might be a bit too curly I'm gonna use a really old like rock star type wig that I've had for a very long time and I'm gonna give it a little bit of a haircut and not gonna cut off too much but it's really nice and straight for this look I'm gonna take off maybe a handful what I'm gonna be applying that at the back of my hat and I'm gonna just lay it going forward think of a really really bad reverse comb-over so it's gonna be hanging over ever so slightly very spidery so I'm gonna take the lock of hair and I'll apply some spirit gum to the base of the hair and then stick that down at the back and then just lay that forward okay hey albeit very flat hair but I think that's the point then it wouldn't be focused on sports talk about the neck bolts so I'm going to be using this this is something about a very long time ago from I'm at several years ago you might remember it for one of my IMATS haul videos but I never ever got an opportunity to use there until now and that is a head bolt which I'm going to double up and use neck bolts yeah so there are the best quality in the world but hopefully you should do the job so they look like this just some awesome neck bolts fabulous so these edges are way too thick to be able to blend so I'm just gonna cut off the entire edge and just choose the neck bolt itself so I can apply some pro stick to the underside of the base and I can just stick that down to my neck yeah so whilst they're drying I'm just going to take the black cream again and do a couple little lines underneath the mouth just little Halfmoon shapes going around here and let them blend that color outwards we'll just make the mouth look a little bit more puffy so then I can paint the rest of my neck and chest and the true chartreuse Matt krohmer cake watercolor so then I think that's pretty much it for the neck I would do some more detail but I'm not overly sure how much skin is gonna be on show with the costumes so with that said I'm gonna pop on my costume pop in some contact lenses and we'll see what we've got and there we go that's my look officially complete so I finished look up pop opening to contact lenses which I was debating whether or not I wanted to have just regular sized black contact lenses but my eyes are quite dark anyway so I thought I'll do something to ampie up a little bit more so I popped in these super opaque looking yellow scelera lenses which I've got from sclera XL com I'll pop that link in description bar below they're just very sickly looking and I love it as it matches the overall complexion the costumer popped on is from Party City calm I'll pop that in description below as well it's a classic Frankenstein's monster costume and to be perfectly honest I'm living for the shoulder pads and yes I really hope you guys enjoyed my take on Frankenstein's monster it's an absolute classic design so I hope it's okay that I put my mini spin on it with the exception of the whole forehead piece is a relatively simple makeup so I hope it's okay that I didn't go too overboard with the design so yeah thanks so much for watching guys if you'd like this tutorial you know what to do like comment subscribe and all that jazz and a super massive thank addictive apps ever and I love it and yeah so until next time bye guys [Music]
