so we're gonna get this play all the way down there but we pick this morning good and Friday in the odd occasion we do this Sunday video what is going on you take a couple of polls today's video I am walking into my cow field we have moved the electric fence back into this field and we are going to look at something very exciting we are doing very exciting today you'd have seen when we put the cow brush back up in January it was very wet it's very horrible it was gross but the cows loved the cow birth [Music] currently have two cows fight over the brush surely this beams I need a double they absolutely loved it you'd have seen them using it all the time this is in the past couple weeks and the guys at Mayo cow comfort and fin ez would like to send me another cow brush put this cow brush is something different a cow brush that goes into the field so obviously our cows are happily grazing we have about ten standing up and that over 110 or chilling out bellies full of grass yeah in a bit of that Sun our plan is they are going to send me a cow brush that goes into the field which is great so instead of using my brand new fences that we did for a viewing area back at the farm shop we are going to use the Cowboys who's going to be fantastic I was thinking of putting it with the Highlands that are in the paddock there but then I thought why give it Highlands when there's only four when we've got 123 I think in the moment in the milking hood why don't we put in here so it's going to get used literally 22 times more desmondo is coming soon and we're gonna find a position to put it I'm gonna guess here cuz I want to have it in an area where the cows can use it people can see it from Barb's shop when they come out the farm shop and they see the viewing area of the horse and the Highland thankfully something else coming as well yes very exciting so that's the idea I'm gonna put white pole to say this is where I was like this is the position and desmondo is coming in a bit there's mondo imagine you are a normal human can you see this here this may pretend to be a cow brush there's yeah all we're doing now is we've got to wait for male cow for comfort to come so we had two positions and I think you're right that state or not it's a little bit further away not drink Chrissy's back Chris did such a good job they sent him again he leaves with Chris today we haven't got Marco and Finn unfortunately they are still in Finland through this whole thing going on wasn't as easy for them to Bob down just Bob over you know there's Mondo's here for top cameraman cuz there's just a new mum job to get it in i Chris you back I think Kayla's here as well sure well how big this hole got a bit because the size of this okay she put that down yeah and go round it exactly where the post was exactly where the middle has to be precisely where it was we have just taken out circle around the base has to be 10 to 50 centimetres in then Chris stood it in like 30 seconds just a bit warm Christopher double-check that this fits that we've done it perfectly but I've no doubts me Chris today the how does it work now Chris twist this into the ground this is the anchor okay we not just tired of poles to the cows and right then walk cow power instead of horses we have two horses in there I thought -
