today's video is brought to you by escape the invasion hey brother J as ever I have always on the lookout for like some cool new Harry Potter merch so when I found out they had released a Marauders collection on the noble collection I was like yes now to be fair James Sirius and lupins wands have all been available already for a while but finally we were going to get a look at Wormtail swan hey guys I have to tell you and I hate to say it but I am outraged I mean seriously just look at this thing look at the snake does this remind you of Wormtail even at all he looks mousy he can turn into a rat he is a traitor like what gives with this design he was not in Slytherin it is okay to have a bad Gryffindor so can we please stop associating this dirtbag with the lovely folks over there in Slytherin we get enough shade already okay sorry rant over maybe in any case the Marauders have just been on my mind a lot lately and that's got me wondering about their like unique ability for most of them to be able to it turn into animals so today I want to try and tackle the question how do you become an animator [Music] link is in the description down below okay so all the magical accomplishments achieved by the Marauders while they were at school including inventing a map that was capable of detecting someone hidden under a deathly hallow none is perhaps more impressive than their ability to turn into animals especially when you hear what has to be done in order to do it and even more especially or when you consider the fact that James Sirius and Peter were only 15 when they mastered it because becoming an animagus is not only like heavily monitored by the Ministry of Magic but it's also insanely difficult to do that said this is one of those rare instances where we know exactly what is required in order to do it a few years ago JK Rowling released a collection of e-books that were just designed to continue to expand this Wizarding World and one of those books was titled short stories from Hogwarts of heroism hardship and dangerous hobbies in this eBook it literally just breaks down the arduous process of becoming an animagus and like always whatever we're just given a direct answer to something it almost invites more questions than actually gives us answers but don't you worry I think we have most of it figured out but before you go and try it yourself here are a few things to consider before heading down this path the book tells us that even if you do absolutely everything right throughout the entirety of the process you can still trip at the finish line and just become stuck as an animal that has no idea who or what you are which by the way totally makes me think that 100 percent there is an animal somewhere in the series that is actually someone who did it wrong what are you doing you're Bob like for real like maybe Crookshanks I feel like he's always sort of described as being like a little extra too smart or you know what maybe even just Wormtail because I'm not 100% sure that he ever stopped being our hatch I mean I mean can you even tell the difference and second there is no way of knowing what kind of animal you're ultimately going to turn into which like can you imagine if you got through the whole process correctly and you turn it's like a drought or something how do you even prepare for that possibility like do you just take the final step like next to a lake just in case and finally it's gonna hurt bad let's get started okay so step one is probably the easiest one to mess up in the process of becoming an animagus and it's probably gonna feel like it's taking a month because it does step one involves keeping a Mandrake leaf in your mouth for an entire month without accidentally swallowing it or ever spitting it out here is nothing and that's 30 seconds I think we're gonna call that enough honestly this alone it feels impossible like what do you do when you were sleeping or like eating other food how do you not like accidentally swallow it or just chew it up and what counts as a month like is the best possible month to become an animagus like February because there's fewer days well at least on that question we do have an answer they do actually specify that you need to have it in your mouth from full moon to full moon and what's interesting about that is the moon itself like kind of goes on to play a pretty big role in this process like going forward to and in case you are wondering like why a Mandrake leaf specifically I we have the answer to that thanks to Hermione and Chamber of Secrets Mandrake or mandragora is a powerful restaurateurs and is used to turn people who have been transfigured or cursed back to their original state so what we think is happening here is that during that entire month what your body is actually doing is absorbing those like restorative properties from the leaf so that once you actually go through the transformation you're like capable of coming back it's basic science but that leaf journey is not done once you're done sucking on it okay but seriously like who wrote suck on it like it's a leaf not a lemon drop these are lemon drops you have got to be kidding me some people say that Mandrake leaves actually taste like lemons so maybe they're exactly like lemon drops the point is though that Leafs work is not done in fact like the entire month you spent like you know sucking on your Mandrake leaf you also probably would need to be getting like all the other stuff ready because at that final full moon you are going to be putting the leaf into a crystal vile as the first step in creating a potion and it's important that you're doing it at the full moon because that potion needs to be getting direct moonlight in fact having pure rays from the moon is so important that if it is cloudy on that second full moon you have to start the leaf thing all over again if it is in fact a clear night though the other thing you add with the leaf to the vile is one of your own hairs that idea is super reminiscent of the apology's potion and I have a feeling has a lot to do with that same idea of the ability to transform back into yourself after converting into an animal then simply add a silver teaspoon full of Dew which actually sounds easy enough except that they do has to be collected and if I'm understanding this correctly from a place that has been untouched by sunlight or wait for it human feet for seven days and I'm kind of unsure about this one like is that that hard to find it is actually kind of confusing though just because they like very nature of going to that place in order to collect it would sort of like introduce your own human feet right unless you know you like spent a squirrel to go and get it for you or something which like yeah I don't see any other way around it you're gonna have to train a squirrel or you could probably just use me my interpretation though is that the not touched by humans part of it is like collecting something that is truly from nature and the no sunlight part is indicating something that would otherwise be hidden in other words you're kind of revealing a hidden nature and as for the do itself I think that has to do with like when do is actually formed either at dawn or dusk which will come back into play later and the final thing that you have to add to the vial in addition to your Mandrake leaf hair from your own head do collect her from weird circumstances is a chrysalis from a death's-head hawkmoth fan now if you're in Europe Africa or Asia you're in luck because where you live these are fairly common and you can spot them by their distinctive skull like pattern on their thorax also if you want to get technical and you know I do moths don't make chrysalis they make cocoons butterflies actually make chrysalis so either way I feel like I know what they're going for but that also doesn't really help all that much because this particular type of moth forms its cocoon underground you know where it's easy to see them all the ingredients though this one to me feels like it is the most self-explanatory it is literally the transformation process of a larva going to a moth which when you think about it that way how could we all just a bunch of larvae but all right you got your leaf your hair your do you dug up your cocoon it's a clear night now what now all you have to do is put all of that into a vial put it in a dark place and wait for an electrical storm once landing appears the final stages will begin but until that time you need to be casting a spell on yourself every dusk and dawn and the spell goes like this you have to take the tip of your wand to your heart and recite the incantation a motto animo Ani motto animagus domo arigato mr. Roboto according at Harry Potter wiki this incantation roughly translates to my love brings me life I am obliged to become an animal wizard which to me seems like weird predictive text but personally I don't really feel like that like means much individually though the words mean love courage and animate and after doing this spell for a while you will actually start to detect a second heartbeat what's interesting here is that like I don't think what it's suggesting is that you were growing a second heart but there is still a beat so where is it coming from it does remind me a lot of slytherins locket where Harry Ron and Hermione were able to actually like pick up on a little heartbeat that it had which kind of makes it sound like you're creating a second soul of sorts or perhaps like even awakening a part of your soul that wasn't before that also kind of adds up with the incantation as if you're actually asking your soul to awaken or animate the animal part of itself so then finally lightning strikes and the moment is upon you once it appears in the sky that vial should turn blood red and you should drink it immediately performing the spell one last time your double heart people get very intense you'll get a vision of the animal you are to become and then before you know it the curious thing about it to me the first time I read it was why does lightning activate it but having thought about it I think I understand lightning in Harry Potter pretty firmly it represents death the chapter where Albus Dumbledore dies is called the lightning struck tower and the avada kedavra spell leaves a lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead in the case of the animagus though the lightning isn't really killing you as much as it is sort of killing the version of you that couldn't turn into an animal it really ties back into the idea of metamorphosis you're literally being reborn as someone who can be an animal wizard even the peculiar skull marking on the death's-head hawkmoth ties into this like it's been reborn but it also has the mark of death on it anyway as I think you can tell in Harry Potter coming in animagus isn't just as simple as casting a spell or getting really good at casting a spell it takes serious time dedication planning and the courage to embrace the wilder side of yourself and literally be reborn sometimes as a trout so Ben or well actually really just you guys I know you don't really have a choice but my question for you is if you could choose what animal you would become what do you think you would choose let me know all of your thoughts in the towel section down below guys thanks as always for watching today's video please remember to leave a like on if you haven't already and subscribe so you don't miss any future Harry Potter action from us if you want to see we go got you yes why uh Draco Malfoy's actually a werewolf you cannot check out this video right here or if you want to see why venom is a butterfly you can check out this video right here but I'm gonna put this in a river
