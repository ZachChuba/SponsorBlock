[Music] this video is brought to you by audible the look of Gotham City has evolved throughout the years with each new iteration the city molds and adapts to fit the tone of that particular story for example in the 1960s television show starring Adam West Gotham City was reduced to a simple setting devoid of any defining characteristics that's because the show is mainly filmed on backlots and sound stages but it fit with the show's overall light hearted campy tone it wasn't really until 1986 that Gotham City began to take on the gothic dystopian aesthetic that has come to define the city with Frank Miller's groundbreaking comic The Dark Knight Returns in the four-issue miniseries it's the bubbling tension of rampant crime against the backdrop of a massive heat wave throughout Gotham that causes an older Batman to finally come out of retirement in the opening lines of Sam hams screenplay for the 1989 Batman film Gotham is described as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks hominis skyscrapers and smoke smother the city in perpetual darkness set designer Anton first tried to imagine a city run by extortion in crime and deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to make often City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable the Bleak hellscape of Gotham perfectly enhanced the darker tone of Tim Burton's Batman and in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy Gotham was comprised of a balance of sets but also on location shooting in booming metropolis is like Chicago and Pittsburgh which helped give the story a sense of authenticity as if Batman existed today in our world ever since Frank Miller's iconic comic book The Dark Knight Returns Gotham City has become a living breathing organism a character in its own right every bit as vital as Batman the Joker Commissioner Gordon and all other characters that inhabit the city of Gotham and I think one of the most dynamic fully realized portrayal of Gotham City was in the cartoon the animated series the series drew visual inspiration from Tim Burton's gothic aesthetic from his films Batman and Batman Returns and were also inspired by Max Fleischer Superman cartoons from the 1940s with their cinematic quality and beautifully rendered movement creators Bruce Timm and Erik Radomski wanted to create a series similar to Fleischer Superman but they also wanted to put their own personal spin on the superhero world they did so by combining elements from film noir and Art Deco in order to achieve the film's noir look with its overall sense of darkness looming shadows and stylized lighting Eric Radomski had the ingenious idea of animating Gotham's landscapes on black paper as opposed to the industry standard of dark colors on white paper this way as opposed to suffocating the light out of the entire page the animators were able to instead bring the dim light of Gotham out of the darkness not only did it save the animators a lot of time from having to paint in the dark imagery time and time again but it also reinforced the story's overall mood and both Batman and Gotham's sensibilities when Gotham City did emerge from the shadows that was in the striking appearance of Art Deco art deco was the popular decorative art style of the 1920s and 30s most notably in design and architecture frivolous and gaudy in appearance the designs were comprised of stylized patterning in upholstery cascading glass work angular furniture zigzag patterns and heavy rounded shapes geometry was at the center of the decorative process and the design was added to it until it eventually became a growing organism at the 1933 Century of Progress Fair held in Chicago the futuristic nature of the designs promoted the technological revolution as an antidote to the depression and at the 1939 World's Fair in New York it provided a fantasy vision of the future Art Deco became the aesthetic for the mechanize aged skyscrapers multiplied rapidly in the downtown areas of cities across America transforming the skylines in these new skyscrapers represented power prestige luxury and glamour and Batman the Animated Series film noir and Art Deco blended together beautifully to create what Bruce Timm coined as dark deco it looked as if the Chicago World's Fair never ended and art deco with all its mechanized style and hedonistic luxury evolved into a hellish nightmare where the haves and have-nots lived side by side and where evil runs rampant Gotham became a city that existed outside of time a city where futuristic technology like cell phones computers and police airships coincide with black and white televisions and vintage cars and clothes from the past the creators also use the sepia color scheme to signal flashbacks within the storyline and used intro title cards reminiscent of classic films and TV shows which further enhanced this otherworldly timelessness all of these aspects coalesced to create a Gotham that feels truly unique a Gotham that perfectly reinforces the overall themes of the series and most importantly a Gotham that needs happening this video is five hundred and start listening to audiobooks right now Tuesday is new video day here at entertain the elk so if you
