check it out at the link in the video description my friends we are here in like 70s cartoon land where Acme portable is a company that actually exists and these guys make pretty bananas computers so this right here is an iMac but you would never recognize it because the whole thing oh oh I dropped the mouse is contained in this sort of portable handled briefcase and closure thing now this is not your average computer for your average user what we got in here is a couple of latches so let's go ahead and release this baby yes my friends this portable computer has one two three displays on it so there is almost nothing left of the original iMac that was inside there's a little window at the back where you've got access to the i/o there's a rerouted power plug over here on this side so you can power the whole thing so we use the term monitor to describe anything that sort of creates an image off of a computer but this is a professional-grade monitor so it's running on like an SDI connection you can have scopes on it everything that you see here is color accurate to exactly the way that you would experience it in the theater so a device like this these are just kind of more more normal 4k monitors so a device like this is intended for like Hollywood productions like let's say they're shooting something out in the middle of like desert nowhere and they need a machine that they can use to ingest footage on the go or you know throw a shot up and see how the colors look do a little bit of lay okay maybe we need to do like a little bit of CG work something like a laptop wouldn't be suitable this is what they would use now it's gonna cost you a pretty penny this guy starts at around fifteen thousand US dollars but on a production like you know what you're looking at here you're gonna need something that's got this kind of like aluminum construction and like huge rubber stoppers all over it or it will not survive and they do all kinds of crazy specialized systems like check out this one so this one is designed for air traffic control it's a little bit more flexible in terms of the configuration this what's freakin heavy by the way I can barely lift it but it can hold up to a full ATX standard computer desktop standard ATX power supply here come on around this side with me it's got a wack ton of cooling fans so we've got 120 120 another 120 fan all filtered so you can see these filters are gonna be able to keep dust out of there and then it's got five hopefully we can rotate that but it's got five drive bays over here on the back and another 140 millimeter cooling fan Oh an optical drive in case you're into that sort of thing now this one is designed for apparently flight simulation and remote air traffic control and check this out yes my friends you saw it here first a hydraulic lift dual display computer I'm just got a pause and let you have the whole experience so this is a cherry switch keyboard you got your built-in little touchpad here you plug this little guy in and boom so the applications for this mostly not civilian but military loves this kind of thing because they can take it with them on the go and monitor any planes in the air using a well Anthony what's the thing called using something like an AWACS this one starts at 20,000 US dollars so unless you've got that military budget you probably won't be buying one for yourself but we just thought this was pretty freakin cool and figured you guys might want to check it out oh oh yeah last thing let me close it up whoop they were very proud of this magnetic latch you know at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys don't miss any of our contacts coverage by making sure you're subscribed and we will see you at the next booth where are they gonna go next no one knows
