[YERIN's mom brought her lunch and rice cake during the fan meeting]
My mom brought me my lunch and the rice cake. I was talking with my mom on the phone a few days ago, and I completely forgot to tell my parents to come to the fan meeting. So I called my mom and told her about it, and she said "oh yeah, I heard it from EUNHA's mom." She said that! So I said "Mom I'm sorry I forgot!" and she said she was gonna come. She asked me what I wanted to eat, so I said I wanted to eat something spicy. I wanted to eat stir-fried octopus at that moment, and my mom said "do you want to eat stir-fried octopus?" So today she brought me some side dish, stir-fried octopus and rice as my lunch. And she brought some rice cakes so I can share it with the members. I thought she was gonna stay for a bit to see me, but she just dropped these and left. [Her mom's very easygoing lol]
I'll see you later! They told me my mom brought me something. So I just sat here, thinking about what she would've brought me, and these were right here. So I looked at it and found out it was mine. Thank you! Do you want to see what's inside? This is the octupus. The octopus, and this is rice. I don't know what side dish this is, but I'm guessing it's octopus. Octopus party! And seaweed. The four of these. And a spoon, chopsticks and a fork. I'm gonna go home and eat all these. I'm so hungry. I mean I did have lunch, but I get extra hungry after every fan meeting. We should eat the rice cake. Let's eat rice cakes. Garaetteok that YERIN's mom brought us~ My mom would love how everyone finds it delicious. It's so delicious. It's so soft. [Hwang Chloe is also eating rice cake!] - You have such innocent looking hair and you're choosing the rice cake like that..
- It's good! It's so good! I actually wanted to eat garaetteok since a few days ago. I want to eat it with honey. But why are you keep on fingering the food.. Why are you making it into a ball shape? No! - I'm not gonna eat it!
- You can't eat this? This is salty. It's seasoned. But you're still eating it.. What do I do? She asked me to eat it. [SINB is so nice lol] I love my girls. I love the members. They still eat it even if I finger the food. It looks like you're wearing a thimble. It's all the same when it gets digested. We all eat dust and bugs while we sleep anyway. Fingering food is nothing.
