[Music] over 95 percent of bird species don't have penises and to us that might sound bizarre but it works they bring their nether regions together much like mammals do but there's no penetration involved and to be up front we don't have one definitive answer as to why but we have some pretty good ideas and by looking at those ideas we can learn a lot about birds and evolution in general now to be clear we're talking about penis loss because scientists are pretty confident that around 310 million years ago the land-dwelling ancestor of all reptiles mammals and birds had a penis the ancestor also laid eggs which were filled with fluid and had waterproof shells that was a key development that allowed animals with backbones to move on to land since they needed eggs that could survive outside of water but it meant they couldn't fertilize those eggs the way many fish and amphibians do by dousing them with sperm as the eggs are laid or releasing egg and sperm into the water and assuming they'll meet up a tough eggshell means no sperms getting in after the egg leaves the female so fertilization has to happen internally before that shell forms and penises are very good at delivering sperm right where they're needed to do that still chickens in the vast majority of their avian kin lack them tuatara the last living remnant of an old reptile order that's only distantly related to birds are also penis-less meanwhile all other lineages in this group collectively known as the amniotes have them though they vary kind of a lot like snakes have twin hemipenes so there's that given such wildly different looking anatomies scientists used to think that the penis evolved separately in different amniote groups when scientists started to study chicken and tuatara embryos more closely they discovered something that basically sealed the deal on a single early penis evolution both species start out making penises see during embryonic development an embryo starts with two swollen areas of tissue near the hind limbs these later merge to form a single genital tubercle which in males becomes the penis or in lizards and snakes they remain unfused to become those two hemipenes we talked about reptiles man anyway in 2013 researchers discovered that in chickens this early tubercle switches from actually growing to dying part way through development leaving a little nub if anything at all and just a few years later a team from the same lab confirmed something similar happens with tuatara that pretty strongly suggests that all amniotes had penises before the lineage split into birds reptiles and mammals it was that universal penis that was modified by different groups sometimes dramatically which in retrospect makes sense since reproductive anatomy can have a large effect on whether an individual breeds or how many offspring it has penises and other involved parts can evolve and change surprisingly fast these findings also made it clear that penis reduction and loss occurred separately at least four times in amniotes that's in spite of the fact that internal fertilization is pretty crucial to being able to live full time on land and early amniotes would have faced strong selective pressures to develop reliable methods of getting sperm and eggs together we don't have a time machine so it's challenging for scientists to figure out why so many groups would do away with something so practical luckily researchers can make clever predictions based on hypotheses and then test those predictions against data they can collect to see if their ideas hold up and there have been at least seven suggested explanations for why so few bird species have penises but few withstand scrutiny like it's been suggested that waterfowl maintain them to keep sperm safe and dry because they mate in aquatic environments but that doesn't explain why ostriches have them or why tuatara lost them or maybe the external appendage just had to go to reduce weight and drag for efficient flight but duck penises can be half as long as their bodies and yet they're a mere 0.3 percent of their body weight and don't seem to impact their flying ability there are still a few strong contenders though the first of these has to do with sexually transmitted diseases or stds see birds and reptiles and even egg-laying mammals use a single orifice for sex urination and excretion this one-stop shop is called a cloaca and it has the potential to be a nasty breeding ground for bacteria especially in birds since they keep their body temperature around 40 degrees celsius a temperature germs can thrive at so it could be that penis reduction was naturally selected for because it reduced the amount of contact males had with this potentially deadly orifice we don't actually know a ton about avian stds but the ones we do know about can be super bad goose venereal disease for instance carries a 10 mortality rate and if the bird survives the infection can cause reduced weight and fertility in both sexes studies have also found that for some species that do have penises males have a nine-fold increase in specialized immune system cells in the penis during the breeding season that suggests mating via the cloaca is a disease threat for them in fact even in birds without penises bacteria spread relatively easily during mating so much so that females seem to have strategies for eliminating unwanted bacteria that hitch a ride on the male seminal fluid so this hypothesis makes sense but we don't have enough information about avian stds to feel totally confident or to rule out alternative explanations it also doesn't explain why monotremes mammals that also have cloacas and are similarly warm temperatured in egg-laying kept their penises but that could be a whole separate video some scientists think a different hypothesis is more likely that penis loss is really about female choice in sexual selection the preferences of members of one sex of a species can drive the evolution of traits in members of the other sex think of a pea hen's preference for the beautiful feathered tales of peacocks who don't have penises by the way well some researchers think female birds have good reason to pick the smallest penises they can find see female birds have to invest a lot of energy to make egg yolks and shells so they may want to say in who fathers those chicks to ensure they're getting the best quality genes for their offspring and that means they might prefer their eggs were fertilized by males that they chose rather than say ones that used a longer appendage to force copulation in a nutshell a preference for ever smaller penises could have given females greater control over the parentage of their chicks this only works because birds fertilize and lay eggs one at a time and up to a day or more apart so a female can know which male provided the sperm for each egg and therefore could decide to abandon or destroy an egg late after mating with an undesirable partner all this means that even though longer penises have reproductive advantages like they get sperm in prime position for fertilization the female's distaste for them could lead to their reduction or loss the catch here is that for birds with relatively large eggs the cost of abandoning is quite a bit higher high enough perhaps that it would never be worth it so this hypothesis predicts that large egg birds should have retained their penises one analysis tested exactly this by comparing relative egg size and penis presence across bird species and lo and behold it turns out the birds with largest eggs relative to their bodies like kiwis do have penises there's other support too like that in ducks and other smaller birds with penises females have evolved tactics to avoid forced copulation and males have continued to evolve treats to achieve penetration anyway still that's a bit short of a slam-dunk explanation after all it's possible that sexual selection is at play but from the other side male birds also want to be sure that they're the parent of their partner's eggs and chicks and most of them have that assurance because over 90 percent of bird species exhibit by parental care when both parents stay together incubate the eggs and feed the chicks a male can be pretty certain the offspring are his and he has less need for an elaborate sperm delivery mechanism but in birds without co-parenting or when extra pair copulations are common there may be evolutionary pressure for a longer penis one that allows a male to get his sperm closer to the eggs than the sperm of any other males a female mates with this sperm competition hypothesis could explain the existence of penises and sunburns while also explaining their loss and ones that have mating and parenting styles which better guarantee paternity but there are enough exceptions across bird families to make this hypothesis a little shaky and taxonomists are still debating what method of parental care if any was common in bird's ancestors our final hypothesis has nothing to do with sex which might seem weird since we're talking about penises but hear me out it's possible that the missing penises are just side effects of some other selected for trait a phenomenon called selectional pleiotropy pleotropy can happen when the genes that control one trait that is under evolutionary pressure also happens to control something else kind of unrelated and we actually know this is the case for genes involved in penis development research in mice lizards and snakes has revealed that key genes in penis formation are also involved in limb development like in chickens a gene called bmp4 dictates the death of the genital tubercle in fact if you activate it in duck embryos they fail to grow a penis and bmp4 also helps dictate limb growth because it's involved in building bones oh and it also governs the loss of teeth and birds so it's possible that selection for changes in limb development or teeth just so happen to impact avian penis size and so long as that didn't cause much of a reduction in reproductive success then this kind of incidental loss could occur while this hypothesis is plausible some think it's a little unlikely to have occurred so many times and especially unlikely to happen with something so central to reproduction but further study of bmp4 expression patterns in birds with and without penises could bolster support for this hypothesis it's also good to remember that not every trait we see is adaptive we tend to automatically think that every aspect of an organism is tuned to perfection but that's just not how evolution works non-harmful mutations or weird side effects of selection could explain a lot of things that seem evolutionarily counter-intuitive and we already know that evolution isn't always about something being adaptive flukes of who lives and dies in a population can have large effects on the prevalence of traits or gene variants a phenomenon called genetic drift the idea of penis loss being a fluke might be hard for our species to grasp especially since they've been a pretty big part of mammalian reproduction but clearly thousands of bird species have been surviving and breeding just fine without one demonstrating that internal fertilization doesn't require a penis so they could have lost them on accident or essentially in exchange for something way more useful to them or maybe it was natural or sexual selection because of how they mate who they want to mate with or who takes care of the offspring we're still trying to pin down exactly why so many birds ditched penises but one thing is for sure the more we learn the more intriguing the story gets thanks for watching this
