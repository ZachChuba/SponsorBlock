hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm with some pepper spareribs that's right they say whoever makes the most
delicious thing using the fewest number of ingredients wins which was the idea
that inspired these amazing ribs and i know i'm not completely impartial but i
think i might have won as these ribs really were absolutely incredible plus
this has to be the easiest method i've ever shared for doing ribs so with that
let's go ahead and get started by mixing up our salt and pepper rub
which is basically just gonna be salt and pepper although we are gonna use
three different kinds of pepper which would be some freshly ground black
pepper some freshly ground white pepper which I
always thought should be called tan pepper and then of course we're gonna
add some cayenne and then last but not least a little touch of garlic powder
which is not a salt or pepper but it is really good in a spice rub for ribs and
that's it we'll go ahead and give that a quick mix and our salt and pepper rub is
done and by the way we call these things rubs but as you'll see they're really
actually sprinkles and then once that's set the only other thing we need to do
is stir together a little bit of Dijon mustard with a couple tablespoons of
white distilled vinegar and what we'll do is brush this over our ribs so that
our salt and pepper rub sticks on a little better and also that little touch
of acidity will help balance the fattiness of the pork speaking of which
let's go ahead and place one big beautiful slab of st. louis-style pork
ribs down on a foil lined baking sheet and we'll go ahead and flip that over
and start with the underside and some people like to pull off that membrane
that covers the ribs but I don't although I do like to make some very
shallow slashes wherever it's exposed as well as give it the old poka poka with
the tip of the knife which is gonna help all our seasonings penetrate deeper
inside and then once that's been properly pierced including under that
little meat flap we'll go ahead and paint over our vinegar mustard mixture
and then once that's been covered with about half of the mixture we'll go ahead
and sprinkle over about 40% of our salt and pepper rub which like I said we
really don't rub we always sprinkle since that's gonna give a much more
even coating and yes of course could do a couple slabs of those smaller baby
back ribs instead I mean guys are after all the LeBron James of your salt
and pepper rib games but personally my vote is to use the st.
louis-style ribs which i think work really well here and that's it once just
about half of that mixtures been applied we'll go ahead and flip this over and
repeat that exact same process on this side and the reason I said to only do
about 40% of that salt and pepper mixture on the bottom is because I think
we want a little more on this side which is the meteor side but we're not gonna
quite use all the remaining 60% since I generally like to reserve a teaspoon or
two in case we want to do a little bit of seasoning after these are cooked and
if we don't end up using it we could just save it to use for our coleslaw and
or potato salad but anyway we'll go ahead and paint and salt and pepper this
side and then what we should do time permitting is transfer this into the
fridge uncovered for about four hours or so or if want can even go
overnight and that's going to give that salt and pepper enough time to work its
way into the meat and will definitely end up with a juicier more
flavorful product but if have to cook it right away go ahead it will
still come out really good and then once we are ready to go we're gonna cook
these using the easiest route method ever invented we are simply gonna place
these into the center of a 300 degree oven for about three hours or until
tender that's it no start high finish low or start low finish high or wrapping
and unwrapping and re wrapping we are just going to simply cook these until
they're done but one quick thing I do like to do is about half way through
pull them out and give them a quick basting with the accumulated juices okay
so after about an hour and a half should have a decent puddle of rendered
pork fat which we'll go ahead and brush over the top and don't worry about the
other side it's fine and that's it after that brief basting we will pop that back
in for another hour and a half or until perfectly tender and hopefully looking a
little something like this oh yeah and by the way when I say
perfectly tender I do not mean falling off the bone okay how we test these is
with the tip of a knife which is slide into that meat with almost no pressure
okay we definitely want that meat to come very cleanly off the bone once we
bite it but if that meat is falling and collapsing off the bone when we cut it
its overcooked and then what we'll do at this point is let it rest for about 50
minutes before we cut them and while they sit we might as well give them one
more base with those beautiful accumulated juices and that's it once
these have rested we'll go ahead and slice them up
and while these are incredibly flavorful on their own I went ahead and paired
mine with our famous all-american barbecue sauce which of course we have a
video for which you've hopefully already seen and since that sauce is a sweet and
tangy Kansas City style it is the perfect complement to these intensely
flavored pepper spice ribs so I slathered some on and that my
friends despite featuring only a couple ingredients were some of the best ribs
I've tasted in a very long time okay this recipe was a great reminder to me
of just how delicious pork ribs are when we don't try to do too much to them and
I'm as guilty as anyone making these with marinades and rubs that have like
20 ingredients but the fairly minimalist approach here really was an eye opener
and taste bud opener oh and not to brag we can see just how clean that me
comes off the bone when bite that is a perfectly cooked rib and I think as
far as service goes just serve them right off the cutting board with your
sauce or sauces nearby is perfectly acceptable but as might know I'm
contractually obligated to take some pictures so I went ahead and plated some
up and squeezed over some more of our all-american barbecue sauce which is
called that because all Americans love it and after taking a few too many
pictures I proceeded to enjoy these and I know I already said it a few times but
let me say it one more time these really were amazing oh and just because I did
mine in a 300-degree oven doesn't mean can do yours over indirect heat and
your cover charcoal or gas grill okay should work out just about the same
which reminds me I'm now saying all those overly complicated fussy rib
recipes are wrong but what I am saying is lot of that might be unnecessary
since all we did here is put these in the oven and other than a quick basting
all we did is let these slowly roast until tender and yet they're still very
moist and juicy and not dry at all so not only did our simple ingredient list
pay off but our very simple cooking method did as well which is why I really
do hope give these a try soon so please follow the links below for the
ingredient amongst a principle written recipe a much more info as usual
and as always enjoy
