This episode of Indy Mogul is brought to
you by Squarespace. There was a massive set in more than 2,500 LEDs controlled
on this giant iPad Did you ask for this? The production designer did and agreed with him - that was a good idea Hey what's going on Indy Mogul today I'm
here with Jakob Ihre the cinematographer behind the story "Chernobyl." Today we're going to do a
cinematography breakdown of the actual series walk through a couple of scenes
talked about it from the camera lenses lighting and actually walk through each
of these things one by one so, Jakob, how was the the process of shooting Chernobyl?
It was an amazing life-changing experience for all of us involved it was
it was very very hard it was a long period so there was an amazing dedication from everyone that really made it. As far as the visual style and visual
concept of it goes any references and inspirations? I mean it was lot of
research made was so much research and our production designer Luke Hull had
done so much research and of course cinematography is often based on great
production design and historical research and this is a small little
detail I guess but I I found they didn't have any frosted bulbs in the lamps was
all clear gloss bulbs because of that the light was often hard
they had fluorescent tubes even in the living rooms in the ceiling so the
mixture of fluorescence and this hard lighting hubs or practicals that factor
that historical fact put some stamp on on the look for me one
big kind of reference or a starting point was the murals of the Soviet Union
at the time and in Episode two I think you have these shots of of a mural we
see the the work of the Soviet working and he's standing next to this Sun and
it's not actually Sun it's atom and so the atom was represented as the Sun
and the fact they looked like the Sun that was kind of a starting point for us
how to to visualize the Invisibles was big and you often see the light
fluctuating is in the sunlight dimming in and out in the same shot and you know
in order to convey the feeling of something is in subtle way it's it's off
and it's it's a different world that we live in after the accident. So for this
project as far as camera lenses go what did you guys use?
We were using Alexa Minis and some Cooke Panchros.
Spherical lenses. And at first we thought of using anamorphic lenses for me Russian
cinema was somehow anamorphic lenses which is very wrong because many things
are not you know spherical of course but so we thought we could kind of portray
this what was even better with these lenses but we kind of switch side and
thought let's forget the machinery of the Soviet Union and concentrate more of
the people of course it's real about the people and and the characters and we
have to be as true to them as possible and not to put a layer between us and
them so we thought let's be as humanistic as possible and I think
spherical lenses are or a more honest lenses in that sense and used
correctly spectral lenses are more or more a humble and more natural
looking lens than anamorphics. Alright so let's get this first clip up and running
let's do this. Yeah this is in the control room of reactor 4 and we shot this in in
Vilnius in their studio in Vilnius but the entire set was gonna build in
England. It was a massive set in more than 2,500
LEDs they've all come controlled on this giant iPad. Wait you're saying every
single one of those little dots in the background? Yea everything is controlled-- What?! I think
was 2005. That was all DMX? Historically accurate as well? I maybe had experts on with us and even made sure that the lights were blinking that correct
way. All right let's draw this up so this is the control room here. Okay so these
are all like the little buttons. And then we have all these
buttons on this box here but the main lighting setup is of course from the
overheads. What are these lights here simple Kinoflo's at first we thought we
would put sky panels which are more controllable but there were shots we thought
we would look up and see actual tubes. Is that the actual overhead lighting here
yeah this is overhead lighting and you guys put retrofitted these with Kinoflow lights. Yes we did. Where'd you start the cameras you had
three cameras spread out in different you know in different positions and
often we felt we were not doing anything visually interesting we were worried
that how do we make this come alive you know behind here we were holding on this
side they were always in the same always pointing the same angles or it was
wonder maybe one next to it and maybe one here but ever never shooting to
watch each other three likes when he's going out at the same time we cook it
spherical glass but you're not really yes and the hard thing was with that was
that the cooks when we had more than one camera because all the sets are so
different so when I'm looking here in my monitor and I put on 75 on this one and
we put on a 50 millimeter on this one they look completely different model to
one is warm on his cold so then before we go for take I am trying to calibrate
all this lenses by using Kelvin at the Kelvin of the cameras and
you see the magenta and green and that was really hard especially they don't
have much time to do this but I was forced to do it because I wanted to show
you know my and everyone and directed three cameras
which are part of the same movies and you knew this was a risk choosing these
lands and that was a big risk and but it was an interesting process to do because
while you were doing and you were so concentrated on the image I wouldn't do
it again but it was a good it was a good challenge as much as we were breaking up
reality with other you know distorted lenses we're also breaking up our
reality for two gear and the fucking shows something is wrong yeah I can
assure and that maybe takes us away from a more evenly lit studio studio set yeah
I Storify have these three divers have been chosen or they have said yes to
this mission to go down underneath the reactor and to find this sluice gate and
to somehow stop the flow of water and this was shot three different locations
the exterior is a real nuclear power plant actually which is a twin power
plant to Chernobyl that which we have access to because guys crazy to have you
know to be there this first part that's not a nuclear
power promise another kind of power plant in Lithuania we had our amazing
German SFX team failing the floor you know dedicate this model swimming pool
here this is shadow stage this one a stage
and there was really hot hand to work in this on this stage of course cos we go
all walking in the water most of all it was hard you know scene to tell and many
times we thought you know what are we really telling here what's going on
people the audience won't find this interesting because they asked we don't
see them barely they have this mask on the concealer faces becomes here them in
a Western monster or was the enemy and it was one of the most powerful scenes
for me at least watch English and be direct and I of the shooting this for
two days we thought you know maybe this one you know end up in the film even you
know because it might not work and then we have this flickering lights and there
was of course everything is based very much on what happened but down here we
don't fully know what happened but it was one idea that they use glow sticks
but for some reason we felt that the glow sticks wouldn't it wouldn't look
correct so we switched to those you can rewrote the script a bit to be able to
use this dynamos when you went through this was there any additional lines that
you added other than the hand cranked lights
yeah we had enormous kind of seelix above the set which we bounced lights in
I think that source force they are steaming up and down which are also kind
of fluctuating you know as the torches fluctuates the the bounce or the you
know the ambience it's kind of what's hitting them in the you know on top of
the head style let me have our amazing sparks standing here they have some LED
unit some LED panels which are on the same which are in sync with the iPad and
also controlled by the iPad or by the DMX and they're giving them fill light
and when this light starts to flicker they flick in the same way so the bounce
back on them flickers in the same way often we were shooting a long tape if
and my god they're flickering too much here how will this ever work and he
might not work but often when you see in the Edit
we often felt actually it's not freaking enough and so in post
we often I had a lot of flicker on to the existing flicker to give it a little
bit more of intensity so there are so many different layers of control in
order to achieve what we in the end have a look
since it's so many layers of control yeah now before we talk about our last
scene I want to talk about our wonderful your first purchase of a website or
domain but now back to the episode one to one in terms of production design
this is exactly how it looked like they said when the trial happened outside
Chernobyl when you're after accident because it was kept from them oh man I
guess oh you're contradicting your own testimony in Vienna testimony in Vienna
was a lie I lied to the world so we used that as our lighting approach as well to
use the lights that were actually there and for the first time we let the same
in a very hard man of a very hot lights and I love that the most part I do I
always you know hope how can we light this film like they did in the old days
nowadays it's so much realism s once you have a hot sauce it doesn't feel real
and especially should color when you use hot lights it looks fake but you get
away with it easier if it's black in white so you never get the chance to
shoot with using hard lights but for this trial saying we did that and it was
at the same time as also the most realistic approach
so the props that you see oh the lights in short they're actually you know
lights from the 80s or maybe 70s there's a real spotlights that they would have
had of these kind yeah exactly and of course we had our own Fresnel lights
around units next to them but times we live and the same with some of
the probes be used so if this was our court case over here where were the
lights set up well if first of all we had the windows
here and we didn't want a feeling of any Sun coming through so we had frames to
kill any direct sunlight coming so this is like do butene right here big 20 but
20 K 20s okay and we also had some Indies on the windows to keep the
exposure the same throughout today's we had that and then of course we used all
the other practicals that you see in short a lot of practicals which are
actually lights from the 80s really clunky and hard to use that many times
actually list the scene with but many times we have our own more more than
Fresnel light or still very hard lights to match the quality measure quality of
this and go to t4 and 5.6 and by then we needed lights and often these slides
were not enough for us so then we had hiding behind some chairs and stools we
had source force which are lightly a spot very well giving us a bounce from
the ceiling as we come hide analyzing short tail we couldn't rig anything in
the ceiling because it was a real location and we're not allowed to put
anything and then you can see above the curtains there are actually some
practicals I don't think they were there in real life in a meaning on the real
trial but we saw have some fluorescence that these are Tino's these are the
keynotes and you can see our summer green and some more white after and that
was also to make it less like a studio proper how cleanly live yeah in fact
perfect yeah exactly so so we put all care in making those some deals more
greener than the others in the trial scene you know you don't see in the
daylight but towards the end of the scene you start to see when he started
mentioning the truce and started mentioning the widest explosion happened
you can see that behind him in the background you see that the Sun is is
coming through the curtain for the first time and it's actually over exposing the
background to introduce a threat again so that's the Sun over exposing a
background there coming through and that was done on a you know one of the
windows in the background we had a big crane here
and I think that an 18 k HMI which was controlled with a with a shuttle is some
kind of like like blinds because we're at the certain point they open up and
the Sun comes themself and comes and hits the background so even though you
put all this work into black it out and to kind of hide the presence of the Sun
at the very end even after the truth is told it's really just reintroducing it
and saying its problem is still here yeah a threat is still yeah yeah ice do
that that is amazing okay all right thanks so much for coming
out really appreciated again amazing job on Chernobyl if you haven't seen it
already it's on HBO seriously outstanding series I think you
