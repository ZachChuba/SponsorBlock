thanks for watching this animated spell book brought to you by a paid advertisement for tail spire XP system now is actually an old holdover from back in the day when you would advance an experience when you secure it wealth as is the case with everything in O D&D though it wasn't straight for Dungeons had their own CR and you divide the goal than any experience from killing local monsters by your level then multiply that by the CR of the dungeon unless the dungeon CR was equal to your level or higher in which case you just take the normal straightforward one-for-one amount no bonus xp for delving into super dangerous dungeons beyond just all the treasure down there so with that in mind let's assume that somehow you made it through the gelatinous cube the acid trap the cobalt scale slits and the riddle room Christopher there you stand in the fifth level of the dungeon in awe of the riches therein but there's a problem it's just you now the rest of your party is dead and Tuckers Cobalts firebombed your followers along with the pack mules so you're just a little wizard with nine strengths and more treasure than you can carry it's in that mindset that we fully understand a spell like tensors floating discs a spell that takes its namesake from tensor one of the first Wizards that ever played D&D and I think it probably was first listed in a D&D although it could be an earlier supplement tensors floating discs creates a three-foot diameter saucer which hovers over the ground holds up to 500 pounds and automatically follows the caster at a distance of 20 feet so no you can't ride your own disk although I guess two wizards with some magnets or wind tunnel could probably get up to some [ __ ] it isn't concentration and you can cast multiple the spell wants to be used in a very specific way though and it doesn't tolerate much play or [ __ ] which is to say it doesn't maintain height over holes over 10 feet it disappears if you get too far it disappears if you put too much on it although I'm sure there's some ways that a creative player could use those limits to their advantage thanks for watching welcome to post notes where I talk about a bunch of the stuff that I didn't cover in that I made it spell book because it's too short this is my friend and guest Jim Davis from web DM he approve it make web DM which is this awesome show where they go into like the Nitty Gritty of like specific things about D&D culture without hitting the rules that hard it's more kind of general D&D knowledge anyway so since we were going over tensors floating disc and oh [ __ ] so tensors floating disc is like this like really weird cool legacy spell and it does not want you to abuse it that is my everything about the way that is written is like a cage very much yeah it's like one of those spell effects that's that because it creates a thing in the world yeah it's open to so it can be open to a lot of abuse and I used to play with a lot of players who were like engineers or really analytical thinkers yeah so if you give them the ability to manipulate the world or or create something in it they will find a way well can I turn it on its side if you had a force can I use it as a shield you know like all of these things oh wow I hadn't even thought of that some guy wanted to you know like use it to protect themselves from falling traps like can I go through the dungeon clinging to the underside of a tensors floating disc as things fall on it you know so what what's interesting about that is that I guess you could if you weren't the wizard but then you would have the wizard would have to be leading the party yeah yeah and then that's never a good good thing no unless CERN I guess unless they're invisible or something like that if they put up their aberration shield with a ritual beforehand and then somebody cast fly on them and then they make four tensors floating disks yeah if you want to like set it all up like that sure somebody has a glyph of of some things that you don't have to concentrate on it yeah there's yeah there's a way to get around all this but yes if you want to spend an equal amount of time that it would take to traverse the traps and get the experience its laid out for you and just avoid everything I mean that's great too I guess yeah yeah I guess your dungeon master isn't using wandering monsters or proactive enemies or something like that you know no I just let you do that then it's kind of on them well the interesting thing about tensors floating disco is that it's I don't think it's concentration no it isn't it's just a fixed hour duration it's a ritual so you can just keep casting it I I also think you can have as many of them out as you want yeah there's nothing in there that yeah I was surprised by cuz almost every other spell is like the first one immediately disappears yeah yeah like it's what like light is one of those that I always find is sort of like come on just let me light up the place like a Christmas tree you know oh yeah well that's silly yeah why wouldn't you be able to write oh yeah somebody abused it once probably yes so so but tenser himself like has a kind of interesting legacies I think I'm not sure but maybe the first spellcaster in D&D yeah I would say so yeah I so I you've seen people try and use it in like creative weird ways yeah all the time ah I mean I guess you could write but then I think yeah we get into weird territory right where it's like rules is intended versus rules is written right um there's just a lot of questions if you try to use it for anything other than carry my stuff 20 feet behind me yes you know like it's it's you know can you I've seen actually who's looking at reddit earlier this morning and Sam's like alright take two of them and attach a plank to them and now you got a hovercraft it's like alright how does that how is it to get attached can you do this how fast is it you know it's yeah it's all kinds of questions I guess you would have to tie a rope between them I for me I I was thinking about it I think I mentioned it in the episode that you could if you wanted to take one person with a gust of wind or whatever it is and they sit on the back one yeah and you would have to have two Castor's creating them right yes every time someone wants to do something different with tensors it quickly gets very elaborate right it's like okay all right just a minute I'm gonna train you and how to cast this ritual okay you know yes exactly yeah like some kind of a sail right yeah I think it's perfectly I mean it does suggest that there are like second third and higher level versions of a spell like this that create force effect based conveyances yeah you know I you know tensors hover skateboard or oh yeah you know tensors force boat yes so but maybe that's the way maybe that's the way to deal with it right yeah it can be it can be this like super broken weird spell but okay so I don't know how far we dug into gold as experience because we were talking about it beforehand but I love that idea it's it's great I love it it's yeah I've actually I've both played in and run games where gold for XP is the main way that you advanced and it completely changes the game totally you know when people talk about like Oh D and E is about combat dandies about this what's like will change up who get how you get XP and and you'll find that you know it really it really changes how players will engage with the game and gold for XP because the gold is hidden it's guarded it's it's not just out there rarely is just out there it encourages you to sneak to scout to make alliances between different dungeon monsters to like play them off against each other it's less of like SWAT team style like we're gonna go in and raid this place yeah and more like there's gold in them thar dungeons let's see what we can exactly you know let's see who we can trick to get it and so yeah it changes the game from one of like a monster hunting to exploring these dark and dangerous places where you're gonna fight it's inevitable yeah but it's not like the point of the game Oh totally um and the this is like everything we just talked about could be in a in a in a post about a toxic DM like desert make us kid oh goal for XP and then they curse the gold and you know they're just laughing in their Tower you know what I mean and so anytime you do stuff like that you've got to be so careful not to be a dick oh yeah yeah it's it's a you know I think that there's a reason why a lot of old school players and old-school-style have a reputation for antagonism and sort of like player versus DM mentality number one the original rule books are rife with Gary and artisans advice to trick fool make life difficult for the players you know because they were very open about the fact that this is a sort of a battle of wits between the players and the DM and they are not shy about saying you're gonna have to get better you're gonna have to be devious and and the like but then they're also very much like when it comes to the playing of it when it comes to executing it yeah that'd be fair also though I mean the hard thing is that I think you know this is before a game design was something that they taught in colleges certainly yeah you're gonna Gary's a shoe repair salesman Arneson was a security guard night security guard somewhere yeah yeah I mean and if you look at like early even early video games it was just like punishingly hard the sole purpose of getting quarters out of you and wasting your time yes and I think like I think in terms of like just the old-school vain and and the kind of play that that requires a spell like tensors floating disk it's very different for new-school players for people who start a play and say since 2000 or so because the new school is very much like this is my character I want to see how they progress through the long term yeah I want to get invested in them and so the idea that you could go through four or five or six characters sometimes in a single session oh yeah is weird you know it doesn't feel right but I will I'm here to tell you the one survives you love them that makes you love them with all your heart beat yes I got a seventh level magic user yeah and he's my first character and he made it through every trial travail he's been burned stabbed you know poisoned all kinds of things but he always made it back and that is my character a game like fifth edition which delivers a very exciting engaging session but the kind of play culture and advice around it is one of be on the player side yeah you know like this is we're here to have a good time yeah as original D&D you're here to have a good time through challenging our ability to navigate this place that's true it's like dark souls kind of well Jerry Hawkins who's the guy from painting arcade he runs the C team which is a cool podcast and you should check it out and stream and video series it but and he was talking about this really interesting thing which is that suspension of disbelief is a state which exists beyond a discreet gate but that each individual when trying to achieve the state beyond the gate requires a different key some people may not require a key at all some people slip pretty easily into that dreaming state but there are people for whom maintaining that the mental state that allows them to believe an alternate version of reality they need a lot of mental props and so in this case it's gonna be a lot of numbers statistics materials so for some people right they need that and and we can say well these people lack imagination or we can shame them some other way like that but look that's that's what that's what they need to get beyond that gate and so I think that there are people for whom the knowledge and the ability to trust that the system is is going to generate predictable results that allows them to engage their imagination but in that case it's sort of like a handshake right it's like hey we agree on certain you know mechanistic principles here so as tempting as it is I think for people to just write off styles where you're you're dealing with encumbrance and load and and all this stuff for some people those numbers and figuring out like how you're getting like as a foreman you're getting that statue out you are actually the way that they're going to that gives them permission to really believe in their character in the world absolutely and I play that way regardless of the game I'm in I kept track of my encumbrance in you know I play in a cobalt presses Sunday night game on on their twitch channel and you know it's very much a fifth edition game yeah Eroica exploits of these individuals and but I'm over here with my character II like okay alright well if I take if I take this armor then I'm gonna that's gonna bump me up a category of encumbrance I don't want you know yeah because that level of detail is is how I engage with with the game yeah so we gotta get we want to get back to tensors floating oh yeah Tesla's floating this book you know what do you think it should do like I've got all these questions about it just that I as a DM that I would want to ask myself like you know can I cast it in the air or underwater yeah what happens to the object that gets between the caster and the disc is it possible to use in a trap set up either like covering a pit that you then just you know dismiss it and then the person falls in it or like if it can be raised higher than three feet off the ground can you like have a bunch of rocks with it and then they fall want someone else I think I'm pretty sure you're stuck with that disc for an hour I kind of like that as well because it's sort of like it's magic no you brought it into existence what a great way it's here now you always know how long an hour is yeah you know in that situation if you can't dismiss it then maybe you're you know you fulfill one of the other requirements you put like it's 500 pounds and you put in you know another ounce on it so that it's you know dispels itself something like that we talk to sort of a bit about the beginning that hopefully people have heard about the difference between like you know a fireball is a big powerful spell but it was like a flash of fire tensors floating distance creating a physical lab for a while and that yeah implies things that they then you know it's clear that they're trying to be like alright what you can't use it to hurl things around at you know arbitrarily high speeds or yeah you know the like I someone on dande beyond was asking if you could use a tensors floating disc in combination with catapult but you have a three-foot disc force oh you mean you catapult the wizard so I you know I I'm not sure how I would well but and then as soon as you start moving a tensors floating disc that fast you have to start to think about like how many g's and then does that affect that's the reason you can't that's the reason you actually can't do that stuff like yeah I might go back and forth on how much science I want in my D&D and I you know there's a there's definitely a limit of like okay what what's gonna work and what's not I where I don't ever want to send the message that like you can't think outside the box you can't do things that are crazy and weird and you can't like you might be able to do it once you might it might cost you something you might have to make a roll yeah and really that you know it just comes with comfort in terms of like running the game and and understanding the rules but I think even new DMS can embrace a style of like yeah think outside the box and you know I at least have these other options for like making sure it's not unbalanced or game breaking you know yeah I think like it's one of those things where learning and and there's nothing in the rule books about this there's nothing in the dmg or whatever you just have to make the assumption but it's like clearly you can use higher-level slots with the same spell to get increased effect and usually it's just damage or duration but yeah I use that as just a rubric for you know okay it's gonna cost you more right look what really it's the question is it's like all right player how much are you willing to give up to get this special effect you know that's that's basically the question I'm asking I mean dude I feel like you just in that sentence that has to go in because you you've definitely improved my game because I'm definitely gonna do that I never thought to do that in such a like a more utility spell adjustment way and it's such a clean way to ask for them to like when when the player is basically asking for a favor yeah yeah you go like okay but you know just spend on yeah more of that resource it's gonna cost you more yeah I know that that we probably we probably missed one or two things but I just want to say thanks so much for coming on la cloche it was awesome talking my pleasure anytime I'm looking down the barrel now I'm not ignoring you intentionally thanks for watching and would you like to shout out anything any of your streams oh yeah sure so I am of course 1/2 a web DM where we're hanging out on YouTube talking D&D and other tabletop RPGs and I'm currently playing in two games I've got Sunday night cobalt presses twitch channel I'm playing a troll kin Ranger get this I rolled three 18s for this character and a 16 my lowest stats a seven though so it's kind of all that's all that's the best that's the best kind of array where you're just absolutely dropping one thing yes so I channeled my inner 17 year old to play a troll Ken Ranger and have a lot of fun with that and then Monday nights I play on Eric vulgaris channel game uh Pendragon which is this like super in-depth you know D&D has one stat for alignment and Pendragon has 13 pairs of stats to describe your personality so oh very much like your your driving you know like my honors at stake so I'm gonna call upon my passion for my family and my valor exactly like that so it's yeah honorable Nile yes yeah
