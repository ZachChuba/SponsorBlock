hi guys and welcome to another room makeover video so I've been at my mum's in Sheffield and I decided I really wanted to makeover at this room this used to be my bedroom but now that I don't live here he's going to be my mom's room and it just needed a makeover like it was looking very very girly and young I think if you liked this video and you liked this makeover and the fact that it is not at my house it's at my mom's house let me know if you would like more of these because there are a lot more rooms in this house that kind of need a little bit of a refresh ultimate rave starter set for 5 pounds we are gonna jump straight into what the room makeover now I'm so excited to show you this one ok guys here is a little before of the bedroom so this wallpaper I must have got like 10 years ago and it's fared so well I actually still really love it even though it's not really my style anymore I think it looks so cute it was from Laura Ashley it's gone quite yellow if you compare that to the why it's discolored quite a lot and it's definitely time to give this room a makeover so we are getting rid of this desk mom took this desk off my hands a while ago and she just kind of shoved it in here but it does not work at all like when I come to stay I have no storage and then moving along this bed was also mine it's just got storage underneath it and then round here mom's just shove this little bedside table compartment thing I do not like the way this room is set out at all it's quite a small room and it's really lacking storage but turning around to this side I've just got a little TV but yeah that wall people just continues on this wall it can't really do anything with this side because obviously I've got a radiator and it's super close to the bed and then if we come around again we've got these double mirrored wardrobes so this is the before of the room oh my god I'm really excited to do this room because obviously this was my bedroom when I lived here and it just feels like I'm fully doing it and giving it over to my mom the rightful owner if you guys didn't know I did a room makeover on this little room that mom really actually likes to sleep in she likes being like cozy I'm gonna leave that as a link below because this room was like yellowy and I painted it and made it all cute but it's kind of cluttered it's got some stuff in it that I want to use in the other bedroom like these pillows see I'm not gonna show you it all but this is where it one sleeps right now the is pretty much empty now I'm just about start and the first thing I've got to do is fill all these holes there's just four of them but we've just taking the TV down I'm excited I'm gonna do the white first because we don't actually have the bottom color until tomorrow so I'm just gonna do the white covering all of this what makes the Sun go to sleep every night and what's it dreaming I wonder [Music] how come the sky sometimes hides behind clouds maybe it's just like me a little bit scared of heights why does the brain always keep on pouring down when it's gray outside it really makes me ponder [Music] it makes me wonder [Music] it really makes me wonder [Music] wonder [Music] how come the trees get Sun tries the planets call and don't miss the leaves they left behind could it be to make the ground to shine like cold until chuckles bunch of a joke oh it's pretty late but I finished the room now I just did white all over so I ended up doing the bottom as well which I fully did not expect to do and it looks so much better I could probably do with doing a second coat of Y on the bottom I'm gonna see what it looks like tomorrow but yeah amazing now I'm absolutely disgusting and covered head to toe in paint good morning guys today the bed is actually been taken down because mum wants a different bed in here the new bed you can see under it whereas this one is really boxy and because it's such a small room it just looks like I'm a box [Music] god you before your [Music] I got to know [Music] God's doing [Music] they scare so guys I'm just in the middle of hanging the mirror up there so in two seconds this is going to have a mirror there [Music] you're is shy [Music] [Music] God soon [Music] you're [Music] [Music] I'm a traveler I've seen many shows from the West specific to the island they treat me like where I go and even though no one can tell I still feel that I okay so mom really wanted a little shelf hung up here so we decided to hang this one from Ikea it's really cute actually it's just a little picture shell because the wall is white it blends in really nicely and then I've got this print up here which was from dicenio-- but the frame was from Ikea we decided to put a tiny little plant there and then this frame which I thought looked really cute this is one of my old frames I didn't use anymore but mom wanted to put a picture of me and her in it on some sort of ride I don't know whether it is actually really like how this turned out it just brings a little bit of colour to that side of the room obviously moving over I've still got my TV there but if we come down here I've got this chair now this chair was actually my nones so I definitely wanted to keep it just a nice it's a wooden chair it's so cute I thought it went with this room because obviously it's wooden and I've got quite a few wooden things in here and this cushion was from Anthropologie ideally I would get a different one in here but we didn't have one so that'll do for now then I've got this little bend down here feel like it's always good to have been in your bedroom and this one it was from Primark and it's so nice I really really like that so moving up as you can see we've just got a dangling plant this one was from Ikea I wanted to add as much greenery to this room as I could and it's just in a pot that was from Anthropologie then in this corner we've got a picture of my brother my granddad and me that is my mum's dad in this little fish frame not sure where that was from but mom really likes nautical things so we have got a few fishy themed things in this room she also wanted this little heart to be hung as well one thing new that I'm obsessed with are these curtains we got these from Dunelm there's such nice fabric and they just changed the room completely as soon as we took the pink ones off I was like yes this room is actually coming together nicely because up until then I was kind of unsure but that's that little corner there and then if we move round over here we've got these gorgeous drawers from Ikea so these were what actually inspired the colour theme of the room I just saw these in someone's video and I absolutely fell in love with them and I asked mom if she liked them and she did so he picked those off they do have a double set of these drawers as well so it's just literally two drawers I mean we're gonna have that at the other side of the bed but the room wasn't big enough but I'm glad that we kept these ones so this room it definitely did a bit more storage and these look gorgeous but they obviously provide a lot of storage I've got four big drawers here I got this photo frame from Primark I love it I feel like it looks a lot like Oliver bonus stuff is just this green velvet and I thought that the Green worked really nice with the rest of the green and mum decided to put a little picture of George in there with a bin on his head because why not then moving along I absolutely am obsessed with this tray it's not actually gonna stay in here and just kind of used it for decorative purposes this is my tray I'm gonna take it home but this was from a shot I think it's called juice or something I will definitely leave it as a link below if I can find it but it's kind of like a different version of Ikea and I didn't realize that there was one near me but that actually was so we went and had a look and I got this tray and I loved it so on this tray you've got this little pot from Sainsbury's home then mums just got her soothing day cream and a Chanel perfume and then over in the corner we've got an aloe vera plant and this plant pot was from Anthropologie a while ago I really like how this turned out I think it looks so nice and then moving above that we've just got this mirror I picked this up from Wayfarer and it's actually so nice it's quite light for a mirror it's only hung up on two screws and I just thought this brought a nice little bit of the black to the room because obviously the bedding has got black in it so it was just nice to accent that then on the wall next to the mirror we've got this from Sainsbury's home I think this looks really cute mom actually bought this and she didn't have anywhere to put it so I just kind of put it there and it looks really sweet can't forget the windowsill I've got this little succulent I think this was from Primark it was in a hanging basket thing but I just took the pot out obviously wanted to add a little bit more greenery so we just put that there and then down here I just got this rug from Ikea I think it looks really cute and it's just nice to be able to get out of bed at both sides and have something really cozy to put your toes on I've been battling so hard with the sauna in this video it's been shining all over the bed and sending my camera crazy but I think it's just gone behind a cloud so I'm gonna do this bit really quickly so we decided to change the bed in here this was a bed from my old house I had two bedrooms and I had a bed in both but I sent this bed to my mom's house that we really like it because you can see underneath it so it makes this smaller room look a little bit bigger it's always good to get things that you can see on Dirks it gives the illusion of space it was some spotty bedding from Habitat that we really wanted but it was sold out and then we found this one from Dunelm it was from the Emma Willis collection and it's just got little spots on this side and then if you turn it over he's actually got big spots on so mom kind of has to bed in sets in one got these cushions from Primark a while ago but they go so nicely with the color theme and then I just stuck this teddy bear blanket on the end I'm not entirely sure why mom got this but I will try and link it below so obviously as I said mum loves a nautical theme and she had got this picture of Wales that was from dicenio-- and she had nowhere to put it and she really liked it so we just decided to put it in here I think if this was my bedroom this is the thing that I wouldn't have in this room I think for mom it looks really nice now she brings a bit more of the black in moving down we've got these little fairy lights these were from House of Fraser in the sale I think mom picked them up one or two years ago and she's never used them but we found them in a cupboard and I thought they were so sweet so I decided to put them on here and I absolutely love the way this bed is turned out I just think it looks adorable moving along next to the bed when we were in that Joost place if that's even how you say it we saw this bedside table originally I had a bedside table coming from habitat but I'm going back to Brighton tomorrow and it's still not here so we went shopping yesterday and we saw this one and I actually really like it this was seventeen pound fifty and I liked it a lot because you can pretty much stain it or paint it whatever color you want but for now we've just kept it the original color so it's just got a little drawer in and then underneath this I've got this box from Ikea just to keep cables in it doesn't look too pretty but it's definitely needed on top of the side table we've just got another one of these little pots from Sainsbury's and at this light I think I got this from Asda when I very first moved to Brighton but mums had it ever since because she really likes it and now it definitely goes with the theme of the room I've got this rug in my bedroom at home and it is so cozy and mom wanted one the same so we decided to pick her one up and this is let's trade my favorite rug ever in any size I just love it but I think it's a perfect one for at the side of your bed it's so soft so this is from where pher I'm gonna link it below again I will leave everything below and yeah that is the end of the room makeover video let me know what you think of it in the comments below I'm really interested to know it's so rare for me to do a video without pink in it I forgot to say that ideally I was gonna paint this part of the wall but we decided against it in the end because mom really liked how it looked white but I was gonna paint it this color and I kind of wish I did because I think this looks a little bit plain still but as I said mom preferred it white and this is her bedroom so obviously I'm not going to do something she doesn't want I'll just do another little quick overview let me know in the comments what your favorite part of this room is I would love to know if you like this room makeover and you would like to see me do my brothers when I'm next here give this video a big thumbs up don't forget to
