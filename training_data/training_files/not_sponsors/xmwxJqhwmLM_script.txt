[Music] all right we're walking towards step number seven this could be the casket but before we do that let's just do the smashing sp didn't even see the special okay dude let's finish him off with a pickaxe please be the casket oh it's another clue oh okay it's wilderness inside the agility training arena we can do that so it's a guaranteed casket boys boom and we're out boys we are out let's open it on our good old spot we do have the hard clues also in the poll i don't know if you guys saw that but there is one thing that didn't get through which is the drop rate of the jar of darkness from scottish so i guess i'm doing my totems because there's no other use for him because the jar of darkness is not going to change so we have a monster clue to open of course of course it's nothing but we want a new monster clue so we have a bunch of heart glue still let's try this [ __ ] oh a pirate's hat hello hello let's go back and open the rest all right more glue openings i almost clicked this teleport that would have been bad any monster clues i'm getting a lot of teleport oh my god did i already have one yeah i had the sarah one i need this on my hardcore but damn that's a new unique and a good one at that this is not for armadill probably not i kind of want to wear that saris shield i think but that's really rare that's nice man that looks good in green all right monster clue now uh we already have that that's a dupe back to the bank we go with the drop rates and uh you're having different roles wait that is not unique wait i have that on my hardcore it is a unique oh [ __ ] that's two uniques already three uniques if you count the shield that is a very bland casket holy [ __ ] that is legit not interesting whatsoever nunchakus i think i might have those already if not that's big oh my god there's 100 unique in these holy [ __ ] we're completing collection log after collection log slot the nunchakus and the armadillo kite shield so that's five total so far already what the hell is that a kebab ancient koif is also unique oh my god we are unlocking slots upon slots here i think this black boat or cavalier is also new wow wow wow gothic's the eyed boots what the [ __ ] is this opening bro i think the gothic di boos might also be unique i know i set the word unique about a billion times okay so it's not but these two were so that's about seven already 15 more and then we got to dive into our medium clue stack boys oh that's new that is new almost got the full enchanted set now pest control teleports sarah coyfe which is new keep them coming dude keep them coming we almost have 300 heart clues completed which means we almost have the yuri emote unfortunately we're gonna not hit that with oh ancient chaps i think i just got full ancient i got the koiv and the chaps look at that we're keep we keep getting unique after unique after unique this is insane this is the best opening i've done so far by far okay eight more can we get a monster clue yes there it is let's take a quick look into the log 84 my god we completed about nine or something look at this dude that looks beautiful all right the first step is the bright ice yo i just got ptsd my heart just pounded when i saw that step but we can do it the big combine oh another joral okay okay i'm the happiest man in the world i'm the happiest man in the world i'm the happiest man in the world oh oh it lined up so perfectly the lineup was so beautiful dude ah i don't even know how i'm going to do this fire cape i assume carol's crossbow we have 11 900 ball tracks we also however have a magic short bow and um 30 000 rune arrows so i don't know what the best idea would be uh do we try and get a magic shortball eye real quick at lms or do we just wing it with the carol's crossbow i'm guessing i'll just do it with the carol crossbow i'm hoping i have enough bolt racks though is 12 000 gonna be enough or do i buy some extra uh right i know what outfit i'm rocking there's no doubt there's no doubt the full ancient let's see the fashion escape no that doesn't look good i think it'll have to be the hit point cape uh then we get the fury what ring do i have an archer ring please please tell me i can imbue this please three million points dude let's go archery imbued that's beautiful this is the gear this is the gear for the fight caves i'm gonna one more time scroll through everything i got we're going in boys we're going in the fight caves uh let's check if i got the right blood spells on let's do this hey hard diary toss look at me uh we're finally hitting there we go get this guy i want this guy with me where's the lost one i'm getting slapped by the healers yo i can understand during the inferno that triple jad is a bit much man holy [ __ ] carol's crossbow chad question mark almost there big plank incoming there it is fire cape on the clue man thank you any peders 81 minutes it's not even too bad thank you boys look at it finally it's been so like so long awaited this thing oh my god bring out the monster clue the fire cape has been achieved and man the melee gear looks insane right now i just need to make this primordial crystal in the next room crafting step and we got max melee best in slot that i can get on this account now hope with this 8 000 taco i can actually buy the uh the toxic we need to get any casketers oh [ __ ] it's actually the casket master casket number six let's go okay that's i guess i could use this on galvic if we ever get the dragon slayer two step i don't know so we're diving back into the caskets we are going to have to dive into our medium caskets i think we have seven more hard clues oh [ __ ] we're just about not gonna hit the yuri emote that's unfortunate any monster clues or anything decent already got that bro i got the whole outfit on any other koi would have been nice come on oh that's disgusting my god what are these oh that might be no it's not it's not a unique we already got that i think those are also not uniques unless this cavalier is oh it is i think no it's not damn it [Music] what all right let's dive into the mediums 1 out of 30. from medium clues please oh man this is going to be trash in it this is going to be so trash oh there it is okay we got a new monster fellow oh my my heart is pounding yes that's a simmy that's the dragon simmy right oh my god i'm so happy oh [ __ ] i might have elked this i don't think i have a mystic rope job dark oh no that'd be a weird grind to go for dude how i'm so happy i kept that there's no way i did i guess keep it moving all right another step coming up i think that's step number four combined baby churro that's really good so it was already i didn't really need to read that out forgot this was a thing right the fario scepter first time into pyramid plunder i've never done this minigame so i'm just gonna follow the boys around here only the last two rooms your search earns okay i don't know when the last two rooms are though i think this might be one of my last rooms oh this is floor oh it says what floor i'm at that's nice i'm on floor five i can go up to seven so i start in six i also do um hey what the [ __ ] we just got a thieving level okay we've come to the conclusion that we for the bank in manifos or sofinam i don't even know which one of the two i think so for them we need the contact quest now it is very cool that the contact quests only give steven xp which we need for the clue we still need 81 thieving it also gives combat xp in the form of lamps but those lamps are droppable so we can do this quest because it only gives xp the skill we need for the clue step quest shouldn't take too long hopefully and hopefully we don't die by falling into the scarab situation and on that note it went really quickly we got done with contact that is 7000 thieving xp and the combat lamp is going down see you later and now we got a bank here for pyramid plunder so that's incredible she's got 75 thieving i'm not doing the first room method because i still need to get 81 for this clue step anyway so that's not really a point i might as well pick up the extra xp that we can get along the way uh instead of just doing the first room method and then going to blackjack after that i actually got a whole thieving level doing the first room method i've been here for 10 hours now i think the average to get the scepter while doing the first room rush is five to seven hours so i'm going double drop rate i have something against staves and uh inceptors i feel like 10 or 15 minutes gotcha wait who got it i thought i had it for a second that scared the living [ __ ] out of me i just thought i got it the zombie appeared even did you just get it sir you got another one [ __ ] off i'm thinking of growing brows exactly oh my god yes oh yes dude [ __ ] yeah give me that thing damn that took a while man ah i'm so happy all right thieving training to go 81 five levels let's go some do some blackjacking or whatever yes that took a good 13 hours almost that is 77 thieving only four more levels to go so we can continue the clue step i also continue doing pyramid plunder because if we get a second scepter this way i can make an occult altar in my house and be a massive upgrade we can make the occult altar because we will be able to get 88 construction and you only need 90 for that altar so that is very very boostable there we go give me the leggings too please there you go this is the outfit we're gonna be rocking the the monster glue step with look at this dude pretty sick okay we got a blackjack for this last level now though 81 thieving right here baby ready to get the new clue step that didn't take that long blackjack is just so insane xp man let's move through this guy and get a new step this is by the way step number five so if this next one is easy we can get the casket he's the priv that's a very very easy one isn't going to be the casket though that's the question it is not it is not is it a sherlock step oh no it's fallow oh just not the arma helmet just give me the fighter torch so if you're gonna give me a [ __ ] [ __ ] one if you're gonna give me a [ __ ] one please give me the fighter torso something with trolls they said something with trolls basalt easy baby all right fellow just give me the casket please here you go my guy give me the casket please casket that's the seventh that is nice another smallish grind for another casket that means we're diving into the medium clue stack again in a bit but first we gotta open this beautiful thing what do we get big pyramid plunder grind well it was only 12 hours to be fair it wasn't that bad but any mimics oh my god that's a big one 600k there's a lot of junk in that but a lot of loot nevertheless holy [ __ ] we go back into this stack where is it 222 medium caskets we'll take the totems out later we'll do get through this whole stack before we go into the totems because this stack has been here for way longer than those stones have been there so let's get through it it's one out of 30. can we get spiked manacles or a new monster clue let's see anything decent oh my god how many ranger boots am i gonna get dude that's the third pair on 6 20. i don't get surprised anymore by ranger boots i was actually looking at these adam and play by the g's which i was excited about and then i saw the razor boots later that's bank value bro holy [ __ ] so many ranger boots look at that a third pair this stack is a hundred mil worth in ranger boots back to back ranger boots no no back to back unfortunately i'm sorry guys three pairs of ranger boots in 20. it's been a bit spoon fit not gonna lie but i do want the medical still i don't really need rangers uh sammy cloak is nice but already have that i didn't check the collection log yet let's quickly open up the medium collection log we might have just gotten a unique by the way we got trimmed skirt and g body so let's see okay we got six of those and two of those so it's no unique yet unless this one was unique unless this was the one we just got but we're still looking for spiked manacles we're still looking for quite a bit still looking for quite a bit so i'm not gonna take a big look at the collection log just yet until we miss like one to one or two things or three things let's say that but let's keep going trying to get that monster that was a trash casket holy [ __ ] the t plate legs though i did see that i did see that we still needed those oh this blue headband might actually be new no it's not okay nothing unique so far i think all these are just in the poh poh of course of course spike manacles please or a monster clue hey there it is the new step 198 medium clues left so that means we went from 222 to 198 which is 24. so we're still not a drop rate on those monster clues any fallows no oh my god i thought he said mask but it's mark i that scared the living [ __ ] out of me i thought it said mosque that improves your grace instead of mark dude all right do i have a mark of grace though oof running it up to 100 back-to-back fellow poison waste easy enough hey boys it could be the casket already and if it is this is the first monster club we didn't have to grind anything for oh crap okay again easy 50 chance of a no grind monster clue step number seven 50 chance of it being the casket no grinds so far is it gonna combine into a casket oh it is holy [ __ ] the first one that we didn't have to do anything for just walking around and digging around the eighth monster casket this is the most monster clues we've done in the video let's open it what do we get oh still no unique dude eight monsters no unique yet zee row all right diving back into this stack this one is slowly diminishing can we get spike manacles or another monster clue please we're still pretty under drop rate for monster clues so we could go a little dry i was gonna say but there it already is after like what was that seven is it gonna be another no grind clue there's absolutely no way is there we can do this we can do this okay this could be the agility step three scary this could be the room crafting step four scary ones herbal or agility fletching and runecrafting or something we have already be the runecrafting step equip an absolute whip are you kidding me sherlock all right boys 50 chance of what is it monster clue number nine is it the casket no it's an eight stepper if we can do this it's a hundred percent the casket oh my god i've never seen an easier step is this going to be my first master clue unique i'm going to open it in the tree gnome stronghold bang that's my new lucky bank we've been lucky in falador because we pulled ranger boots again but trinum stronghold is going to be our new lucky bank pick up the casket is that a renault no it's an earth you know what 100 herb lyrics be i'll take it um let's go the first monster clue unique is what we're hoping for it doesn't matter how [ __ ] it is can we get our first third age maybe on the clue account the closest i've gotten through third age is the 100 battle staves on the hardcore we haven't even gotten close to third age on this account trino stronghold bank please oh yes tournament ornament kid 7.2 mil that's the first unique and that's a very like a lot of people want this right i can never in my life use this unless we decide at the end of the account to grind for the things we have ornament kits for maybe that's the thing but for now that's going to be on the bank for a very very long time but my god i'm happy it's my very first monster clue unique back to the 191 medium clues new monster clue or spike manacles please i think this might be unique actually but i don't know oh my god dude we're getting these master clues like crazy are we gonna be 17 steps without a grind probably not probably not sherlock i'm coming dude i'm coming are you gonna let me equip a whip again or are you gonna oh my god i can do this step dude i can do this step he's being too kind i thought for a second this was a new step i got all of it i got all of it i think oh wait don't i have a bride saber i was pretty sure i had one oh i don't i'm gonna have to kill [ __ ] brine rats dude all right i mean small grind but it works yeah i've never done brian rats on this account wait olaf's quest oh we don't have all those quests done hey every time we can do a quest i'm happy and that is the quest already olaf's quest done if we open this chest there we go 2 000 gp for rubies and we'll get into the grinding of the brian ratz now skip's got a little bit for me going if i get a sub 50 kc he'll bond an account of my choice so we better get it quick this [ __ ] chat is about to kill some rhine rats a little over geared but putting the cannon down on all dude death rooms i'll take him it's not gonna be a lot but how many were killed 31 no skips uh i'm be expecting that a bond in a little bit that is 34 brian radz and the clue step is over finally we're done that's the easiest bond of my life hello sir it's a fight one in 5 12 i thought i was safe you are not dude the spoon fit has returned thank you so much for the bond dude i appreciate it instant redeem that baby all right boys the talks got that and now we have to be very monkey and we have to go to the wilderness to get the clue done this is clue step number five too so if this next step is an easy one then i can in fact get a casket again so let's see what the next step is fair enough i'm pretty close to that no casket oh and a fallow the gloves of white they won't hatch a fight is cooking gauntlets someone actually called that in the chat yes oh it's step number seven too give me the casket fellow oh no yes that's another monster casket oh my god i think that's the tenth one too and there we go this is casket number 10 dude maybe the priffin ass bank will give us some luck for the second unique this is a bank with a lot of emotional value with it crystal imps here we grinded volcano on the hardcore we just did some of the elves on that account so it's got some spiritual value will that spiritual value give us our first third h piece or our second unique from master clues no and it's actually a pretty dreadful casket that's a lot of nature runes but oh well back into the mediums let's do this we are very oh [ __ ] golden elegant skirt i gotta check if that's unique or not because that's a rarer thing than the others yes it is yes it is we're only missing one more piece of elegant and elegant is the most difficult to get so that's really really good man we almost don't have any elegant dupes let's keep moving elegant well we only need one more piece of elegant that is not that one any monster or clues for the boys a decent amount of uniques holy [ __ ] look at that not really unique to me but i mean medium clue uniques oh my god a cryo code already got that unfortunately we've gone through 25 already no monster clue it's one out of 30. but we did go very lucky on the previous couple so uh wait a minute bank phil oh no my bank is full what the [ __ ] a new monster clue would be great please this is 35. medium clues no a master yet hey there we go that was a 36 let's see what the new step is though any grinds we are 23 steps i believe without a grind if you don't count the saber oh and it's sherlock this could be big fletching stepper rune crafting step would be the best one to get or the 81 herblore step bro come on what are these weak ass steps sherlock i'm trying to look for a grind here dude here we go nick's arranging mix yes that's 81 step i think wait makes a ranging mix where is it where is it where is it 80 yes yes this is the best step i could have gotten that is the best step i could have gotten the in between step between 73 and 87. we can finally make stamina potions too if we want we can boost for this step i'm probably not going to do that we did keep these lamps in the bank for herblore's step and there it finally is dude finally we also i did not forget have a step uh a lamp in the varrock museum from curse of the empty lord i did not forget that so let's go and grab that one and then we can finally use our lamps that have been in the back this is the recipe for disaster lamp guys you know how long that's been in the bag for ages i thought it would give you all the lamps in one go but there we go that's the 10k xp lamp there it is all right boom 20k and this is the one from recipe for disaster that has been in my bag for ages and boom the new clue step 80 herblore what i've been waiting for for so long and perfectly before the 87 one streams in the videos i appreciate you you haven't already and i'll see you guys in the next video next week [Music] you
