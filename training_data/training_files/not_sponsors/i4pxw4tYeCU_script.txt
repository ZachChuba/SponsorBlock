hi the 5g is upon us it is the new technology in cellular networking and provides massive communication speeds and with it brings tons of controversy the thing is that it's using a much higher frequency band than previously used and everyone is wondering what it can do to them now don't go around and tell people that 5g is 5 gigahertz and we already had it in wireless routers and cordless phones and it's safe what are you a noob i've been telling that to people it is the fifth generation the fact is 4g that we have been using for a long time and is also called lte can be anywhere between 600 megahertz and 6 gigahertz while 5g in some cases can be 28 or 39 gigahertz but can go as high as 300 gigahertz 300 g i can't even comprehend how they make that kind of frequency while i have trouble making a proper one megahertz on my stupid breadboard but if our microwave ovens cook food at 2.4 gigahertz what is 40 to 300 gigahertz capable of it would penetrate our bodies is it cooking us all slowly making our organs fail is it breaking the dna inside the cells of our children and loved ones mutating our genes increasing the rate of cancer killing us or even worse would it create even more lethal mutations of dangerous bacteria and viruses killing millions my god the current pandemic started happening with the rise of 5g towers is it really no the answer is no toodaloo what you don't take no for an answer i off from byraecon.com electroboom now if you're interested in why 5g and how the technology works there is a great video from the signal path i'm just interested about how well it fries people okay i know there are some old debunked researchers about that mobile phone signals can cause cancer or electric smog and [ __ ] of that sort throw them all out and let's start over i start with simple stuff so what 5g can go up to 300 gigahertz all radio signals or electromagnetic radiations are what we call light at different frequencies we happen to be able to see a certain frequency range strong visible light can penetrate deep in the body and pass through our tissues the visible light frequency range is 430 terahertz to 750 terahertz over a thousand times more than the 5g capability in fact the 5g frequency band stops right at the beginning of the infrared light range which is from 300 gigahertz to 430 terahertz all i'm saying is that if the regular visible light at such massive frequency doesn't split your dna 5g for sure won't sunlight radiation energy is so high standing in it will warm you up in a jiffy 5g energy is so low you feel nothing unless you hug the antenna i guess still not convinced yet eh fine but i'll have to dig deeper and that will make the video boring it's your fault this video is boring so slap like now and subscribe you need to understand how cells mutate or cancer happens which you probably already know your cells contain dna that holds around three billion genetic letters out of which only around one percent is directly responsible for the genetic code that shapes your body curse gazette has a great video on the subject you should watch but let me simplify it here every cell makes a copy of itself by splitting the dna to half and then rebuilding the other half one letter at a time to get two full dnas to pass the genetic information if the dna gets corrupted right at the one percent essential letters that matter well that's bad the corrupted cell will malfunction your body has many ways to get rid of the corrupted cell though the cell has a self-destruct system just for this or it can be detected and destroyed by the immunity system so a bunch of essential dna code must get corrupted for the cell to become cancerous it must disable self-destruct disable detection by the immunity system lure the body to direct all the resources to it and enable fast multiplication so you can imagine the chance of one cell getting cancerous is very low one in a gazillion but then because body has gazillions of cells over the lifetime the chance becomes pretty high so why does the dna become corrupted and cancerous in the first place there are different reasons like under some conditions the cell can make a mistake copying the dna or some chemicals like asbestos or some bacteria or viruses entering the body could cause cancer or very high energy radiations which can be alpha raised at our high speed helium atom core or beta rays that are super high speed electrons or ultraviolet x-ray or gamma rays that are very high energy light particles these are what we call ionizing radiations but why is ionization a bad thing human body runs on ions like the acid in your stomach or the electrolytes in your blood or the electric signals through your nerves and such not all ionizations are bad only those that can corrupt the dna ionizing radiations can pass through all the body protections and penetrate the cell easily and they can break dna links and can go haywire but let's just focus on the electromagnetic side of radiations and see how electricity can hurt us in general i am an expert in electrical hurting after all ok placing electromagnetic fields across a conductor like human body results in electric current running through it for example a battery is a source of electric fields if you like to feel the electric shock pain in a relatively harmless way you can place a 9-volt battery on your tongue dammit i never get used to it of course you can only do it momentarily don't dare yourself to go too long because it can warm up and hurt your tongue over time and can cause chemical reactions the reason you feel the pain right away is not because it's damaging your tissues it's because electricity messes with your nerves and you feel the pain electricity can cause nerve stimulation from zero hertz dc this is zero hertz i tested it in an old video [Music] somewhere above 20 kilohertz i stopped feeling electric shock which means at higher frequencies your nervous system doesn't get stimulated by electric current running through your body messing with your nerves can be little because you could lose control of your muscles which means if you're in water you can see him and you'll drown or your lungs won't work and you can't breathe or your heart stops beating typically people dying from electric shocks die from such complications which means they suffocate also at dc or low frequencies there can be harmful chemical reactions like splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gases although smells like bleach shouldn't have put salt in it but the pain of running high enough electricity for chemical reactions is so high you either quickly let go or die of other complications of course of course dying from electricity is bad but maybe if you are voluntarily holding on to electricity for too long despite all the pain because of some stupid dare and you die from chemical reactions maybe you deserve to die anyway somewhere above 20 kilohertz you won't die from electrical paralysis because you won't feel a shock but you can still die at any frequency from another enemy which is heat electricity creates heat through conductor resistance and depending on the amount of electricity it may cause anywhere from unnoticeable heat to tissue burn to straight up blowing up your body now of course in our day to day lives any risk of exposure to direct powerful electricity is either dc from batteries or ac from the city power outlets at 50 or 60 hertz any other higher frequency exposure comes from radio waves finally we are getting into our area of interest radio waves which are electromagnetic waves or light can generate voltage across a conductor but the voltage across it depends on the wavelength or frequency imagine you are lying in the water if there is a wave with a wavelength much larger than the size of your body then no matter how huge the wave is your body stays flat no potential difference across your body or as in radio waves no voltage difference but when the frequency rises and the wavelength becomes compatible to your body length or the length of conductor in electronics then it can create a potential difference across the conductor so there could be current running through your body but the energy of the source must be very high to create enough current through your body to warm it up like in a microwave oven that's why all radio frequency bands have strict power limitations in every country to ensure not to warm up body tissues by radiation you might ask then how about breaking dna and mutations by radio frequency that's the thing the only thing our radio frequencies can do is to heat body this is from canadian government website despite numerous research only adverse health effect associated with rf exposure from three kilohertz to 300 gigahertz is tissue heating at any frequency and nerve stimulation at around less than 20 kilohertz why am i trusting the government doesn't the government want to control our brains and slowly kill us off with radio waves no stop asking stupid questions the reason they say that is because of a simple fact that the frequencies we are using are not ionizing but what does that mean like i said electromagnetic waves are rays of light and photon is its quantum or a single light particle that can oscillate at different frequencies and the energy of photon has a direct relation to its frequency if a photon hits an electron if it's the right frequency the electron can jump to the next available orbit and then jump back reflecting the light out or if it's the wrong frequency the atom absorbs the energy and shakes and creates heat and at some other frequency it can just pass through now this means if a photon is very high frequency which means high energy it can knock the electron out of orbit and into the environment for example at the top of the atmosphere a strong uv photon can knock an electron out of an oxygen pair into the next pair that pair is like ew too many electrons and splits the negative oxygen pairs with the positive pair creating ozone the same thing can happen in a living cell if a high energy photon enters the cell it's nothing else but an important chain of dna it can shoot an electron to the wrong spot changing chemistry the dna chain breaks and a mutation happens but the photon has to have high enough energy to knock an electron off photons all the way above visible light uv light type a and type b don't have enough frequency and so that kind of energy to split anything it is only from uv type c starting at a thousand terahertz or one petaherds upwards into x-rays and then gamma rays that photons have enough energy to ionize molecules all 5g communication can do is to mildly heat you up if it is powerful and standards make sure that it can't even do that well i'm sure you can pick up a 5g transmitter of a black market that can cook you it doesn't matter if the transmission is continuous or pulsed no matter how high the transmission energy is the photon energy remains the same at a certain frequency and at frequencies lower than a thousand terahertz it doesn't have enough energy to be ionizing the minimum required ionization energy is around 3.9 electron volts but dna being made of oxygen hydrogen and carbon requires above five electron volts of energy to ionize calculating the photon frequency gives a minimum of one point two thousand terahertz you know how old ships use lights to communicate that communication was done above 430 terahertz 5g is only 300 gigahertz come on man i was wondering maybe if you warm up or burn the [ __ ] out of yourself you could get cancer but i read a paper that based on two major studies there is no observed correlation between burns and cancer so if you can enjoy warming up in the sun by infrared waves with sunscreen on of course uv from sunlight creates skin cancer then why would you even worry about the 5g radiations that are not even strong enough to warm you up we will continue monitoring their potential effects but don't worry they are safe this video was like a large research paper that you could listen to using your own raikon earbuds you can get from buyreicon.com electro boom i personally don't like those earbuds that hang from your ears and make you look like a giant poser i like my low profile like this this
