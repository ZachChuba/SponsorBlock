hey guys welcome back to my channel look who's back me i mean it hasn't been that long sorry no it's it's like i was never gone yeah exactly really right so i'm taking over i'm not i mean try me so as i said in my last video with kim i said that i would bring her back for like reaction videos and you insisted on doing this production today oh yeah i'm doing it today yeah yeah sure uh the plan is to have me react to a few different music videos but i i don't want to wait until all of them are out because this one just looks too good like from the pictures yeah yeah so exactly so what we go what i'm gonna do since i'm the one editing the video i'm gonna put the clips together and everything and so we're gonna you know change outfits etc because they're gonna be filmed on different days so don't be surprised okay this is we're gonna serve you looks hopefully hopefully this is more and more i reacted to it yesterday oh by the way if this is the first time seeing us two together reacting to something we are very different exactly opposite i would consider myself being a lot more expressive yeah hyper you in the under area i didn't notice last time how just still i was like when i looked back yeah at the video i was like can i just say like can i actually say something can i show emotion but like you guys weren't bored so i mean i think from the comments yeah yeah people actually i feel like more like the majority of the people who commented under the veto actually appreciated the fact that we are showing different type of fun girls i obviously have already seen the music video i have been stopped listening to the song oh you know the album for me this is one of their best ooh but then again some people are just very like on the complete opposite side saying that this is actually a let down and like oh and we're like expecting more that were disappointed and it sounds a little bit flat to them so you know just go in knowing that again i won't be putting the captions because i don't like captions i don't want to read should we go ahead and uh yes all right let's ready more and more oh my god they're so pretty i know did you wash the teasers for this yeah yeah okay yeah they're stunning the sets are really beautiful right and that's pretty cinematography oh she's back with her analysis wow i'm gonna need to like restrain myself like that has been stuck in my head for so long i know ever since it came out [Music] what's up with jyp and the bad cgi can i [Music] um there's so much going on the screen okay yeah it's kind of like taking lsd you know know that i know right i mean it's like what i would imagine oh yeah that's so different you did not see that comment did you no i mean it sounds like where was in the medley and and the teasers were like it's so different from the boob thing sorry as i was saying it sounds very different from what twice has been doing so far i like it [Music] i love her hair she's stunned name it's like what chang had during dance the night away right the orange the part of it oh wow oh that's pretty why did it focus on the horse what's up with the horse [Music] it sounds so good [Music] i mean okay i don't think it sounds as summery as like dance the night away but it's good [Music] i've replayed this so many times the formation is so nice i know this must be one of their like prettiest dents in terms of like formation yeah in my opinion [Music] [Music] yeah it's a lot it makes me think of like idol no not idol yeah yeah i don't yeah where are those pants like all the other outfits are so nice but then you have these pants [Music] i gotta love it so much and then they end it like this as if there's something more to come i know i realize only afterwards all right i mean so there's a story behind it obviously so like the snake in the apple that i get what about the horse so okay my interpretation of this is this is like paradise right yeah so like the with the animals and everything so you know the gate of heaven they're in there with this like as you said apple how do you make in the apple aren't in heaven is the garden of eden right yeah that the biblical references yeah there definitely yeah i suppose there is more or maybe not maybe we're looking too far into it maybe but i don't know other than the the theme of it how what do you think of the song i like it i would like you you said it's uh a summery bop yeah it is but it's not the best like you said the music video was a lot it was a lot i mean i like the colors i like um just how the shots were planned and how there weren't useless camera movements again i'm back with it but just the editing like there were just too many effects in my opinion it kind of took away from the experience and it's just it's personal some people might like it it adds like something dynamic to the video but it's not my favorite aspect right it's kind of like psychedelic a little bit yeah which maybe might have been the the whole point i don't know i definitely think it was the whole point where probably they're not just throwing it in yeah because it's fun right and i also said about the song that this sounds like one of the most mature songs so far yeah for sure but sorry that's why it sounds so different from what they had okay i mean last album the fuel special already had tracks that sounded more mature but this one i feel like is a step even yeah yeah very different absolutely i like it though yeah yeah so one of the reason why it might sound so different to you and a lot more people myself included is because this album a lot of western producers have worked on it sounds like that's the case yeah absolutely so a lot of people have been saying it doesn't sound like them and like it doesn't have the twice signature sound and some people are disappointed by it i get it i mean i'm not saying it's bad i like it but it's true that it's not the same vibe from their other like summer bops like you're saying me personally what i said is that this just shows growth as you know they are transitioning i've said this word so many times already but they're definitely transitioning gradually into a more feminine like more mature concept you know i mean i like the fact that it's different i'm not sure i'm a big fan of the fact that it sounds american just because it's not the type of music that i like and like kpop has definitely become a lot more american for sure yeah we're not going to get into that no that's a different topic for sure yeah and apart from the dance break there wasn't really like a big drop or so that's why there wasn't enough right that's what people have been saying as well yeah they i've seen many comments saying explaining that to those people it felt a little bit flat and the teaser veto gave too much away probably yeah i feel like i wasn't that surprised because feel special kind of already had like a different sound i'm not saying it was like edm or anything but the the last album had like very surprising tracks so oh yeah for sure i was expecting a surprise maybe i don't know i mean i wasn't surprised by their surprise i don't know if i was expecting it but that's funny okay yeah we definitely see things differently like we bring different arguments and different points of view on the music video why both of us like this song yeah it ha we have different reasons on liking like to like no well i just want to say that it's really hard to know how much i like the song because i was talking at the same time right right right i don't know how you do this i mean i can tell that i i like it i just don't know how much i like it that is one music video there should be two more reactions we're gonna see you guys in the next reaction which is now now hey guys hi we're back but it's the same video it's just us from the future but from the past for you right so i selected two other music videos that i personally believe that you should watch i chose eyes one for you and blackpink pink just came out like literally like two hours ago yeah that i would have watched uh should we start with eyes one first sure since it was the one that was first released all right so this is called secret story of the sun don't don't don't what's up with all the stories in music videos like with got7 last time and now this is there an actual story with a swan in it i've got no idea okay i still i don't know anyways uh let's just go ahead this in my opinion is one of my favorite songs of this year oh of the year i thought it just devised one that's my favorite song of ice one but okay yeah it's pretty [Music] my favorite song on twitter what are they saying next one so and so on that's why you put captions i'm sorry i heard let's swan as if it was a verb [Music] it's not very different from what they've had before it's much more like yeah yeah i feel like i say that every time [Music] are those gems on our eye oh my god gorgeous yes [Music] i mean do i really need to say how gorgeous they are i know everyone eyes one looks amazing [Music] it's so like okay because like most of the songs they've had kind of sounded similar since up to now right she's so tired i know [Music] like they have they definitely had like a signature sound yeah this so far is the one that goes further yeah yeah and the looks i know wow [Music] wait is the music video actually telling the story i've got no idea because i don't get it i've got literally no idea [Music] the choreography for this one yeah intense so that's why people want to want you to watch a performance video right yeah yes [Music] i feel like they've always really had like intense choreography yeah for sure but this one with the beat yeah you know obviously [Music] the music video is pretty too yeah i mean true oh gorgeous this one has to be had to be revised by the way oh really yeah [Music] oh is this good she got so much better you don't even know like people who really praised her for improving so much like tremendously yeah like even just a dance dance wise yeah she freaking like i i don't know her skills just exploded like honestly the dance version i watched a few of their um what is it come back stages they are killing it first of all they're gorgeous the vocals and everything but like the dance dude i'm telling you the dens one of the best again of this year this comeback for me is one of the best of the year i definitely like the song better than i did fiesta yeah which i did like fiesta very much yeah i mean personally i ranked you know the title track this one secret story of the swan then la vie enjoys then your french accent really came through then you let that then fiesta i write it that way okay yeah i can see why well i loved all of them you know i still prefer like this one just i have to admit that i haven't listened to much of their other title tracks like okay i only really started listening to them since fiesta and that album and i like the b tracks a lot more than fiesta right but i mean i enjoy the songs either way okay i don't know if i could rank them because i'm not that yeah right right yeah that's fair that's fair enough but i would say that this one's probably what i would like the most best yeah yeah yeah i mean i've only heard it once it's kind of already stuck in my head you said it's one of the best song of the year yeah for sure in my opinion that's one of the best comeback of the year visually speaking music wise everything was just so good so yeah better than blackpink oh that's different and like this is like a natural comeback blackpink song is a pre-release it's not comparable in my opinion it's definitely different like blackpink just came out this year you know so like in my head i'm already more stuck to this one obviously because i've listened to it more if that makes sense so how you like that i loved it but then again i'm someone who is extremely biased when it comes to yg yeah to begin with so i suppose you're going to be more critical of things probably i mean then again it's your opinion i feel like i've seen people in the comments being you know i don't like this song like it's so really it's a yeah they felt let down a little bit and they were expecting more it has been so long so people are obviously going to be very hyped about it for sure like especially because as you said because it's been so long people would you know have high expectations and they would expect something that just goes beyond their expectation and sometimes well it's just not it doesn't mean that the song is bad it's just like you had too much of a high expectation does that make sense yeah all right okay so without further ado how you like that let's just go ahead so is it the same set as the pink there are many similarities okay you're seated [Music] i'm surprised yours is hair hasn't fallen off my nose [Music] were you expecting that i don't think i like that no i wasn't expecting it [Music] i feel like i feel like it's something i always [Music] exactly [Music] okay it's something that i've always thought kind of with a lot of recent black pink songs because i like this song just not the chorus oh okay interesting [Music] oh the makeup though oh they're stunning [Music] i don't know how it feels about the better being but are they dissing us they're dissing the the haters i suppose okay i still feel ugly [Music] i mean yeah [Music] it's a bird it's a plane yep no it's superman oh that wig she has a bob ooh what [Music] i like the wigs i like the lyrics okay that felt really short i mean it is it is really short so i'm all kinds of confused i don't know if i like it or not i mean it's okay yeah it is it's not bad i mean i'm trying to gather my thoughts you know the lyrics man a lot of the lyrics weren't actual lyrics like actual words the song itself is catchy and i get why there are lyrics like that because it's always catchy just like bombay i was and a lot of yg lyrics are the song is catchy the music video is amazing the looks are incredible yeah i didn't focus a lot on the vocals what is it the killing point of this song are more like rap parts i'm sure they were still good even though i didn't focus on them and inside i don't like it i said i don't know if i do but it's probably gonna grow on me at some point i mean even if it doesn't it's okay okay so that concludes the three music reactions now there were many other music videos that you still haven't watched i believe i don't know if you have any idea of music videos or whatever that you'd like her to react to in the future maybe if you are still down for it i will but i mean that was so french like just leave them down below and um yeah that was it my brain it like you know the error message on windows yeah that was what i thought the pop-up she was like yeah as always don't forget to go and follow my sister on instagram even though she doesn't post now anyways get back on it please come on girl look your semester is over you still have a few paper to turn in i get like three but then afterwards you can get back to it yeah i don't know i haven't been feeling it it's gonna come back watching and we will see you next time bye
