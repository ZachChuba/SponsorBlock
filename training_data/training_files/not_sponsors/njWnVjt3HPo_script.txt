[Jacket Photo behind-the-scene story] [Chung Ha got something!] [Shy Shy] Should I show them like a presentation?
[What is in the tablet?] This was my first outfit [Chung Ha introducing her Jacket Photos] It was on a rooftop I had never done this on a rooftop with the sky on my back looking down the camera My eyes easily get irritated by sunlights So I was kind of winking to figure out what the director was saying For this photo the background is actually a fabric It was amazing because it looked like a real building and I really like this pattern outfit [D-21 Jacket Photo Shooting Day] [Jacket photo set with beautiful Chung Ha] [Chung Ha preparing for a photo shoot 
with her pattern outfit] I feel like I have to give this pose [Full of fun] [Boom-bop Boom-bop at a joyful music] I think this outfit looks good with my piercing [I love cactuses] [Everyone lives the piercing] I want to check my cactus Can I use your camera? my cactus... Are you there? Yes, he is [Still beautiful in a super close shot] It was so close [Warm up with a wave dance] [She got the photo concept] [Charismatic Chung Ha] [Concentrating without being disrupted] Wow So beautiful [The staff really love Chung Ha] Stop pretending [The first shooting is done under a warm atmosphere] [Outdoor shooting with a summer outfit] You have to go up there Really? Of course [So doubtful] somehow I can't really trust him I thought he was joking [No, he was not joking] [Everyone climbing(?) up] [What is awaiting her on the secret rooftop?] It's even more scary with the high heels [Oh my god] [Is she really scared...?] [Feeling the wind] [Pose on] [Blue sky is her background] [Sky looks so beautiful with Chung Ha] [Summer Queen Swag] [The dazzling sunlight doesn't bother her] [Chung Ha with another outfit] Can you show your shirt in front of the camera? [Wave Duo] They love my hair color [It makes her even more gorgeous] Are you satisfied? Yes I am [Working on another lovely styling] Oh, be careful Are you okay? [Full of fun] [one flower on her hair] I feel like I have to go have an audition [Dance Dance] [Flower arrangement style] [Behind-the-scene story of the flower concept?] She cut the flowers one by one They are all real flowers I really love the outfit So it was a super flashy style This is my favorite outfit I got two bandanas So greedy right? This song reminds me of red color and some strength I guess it's same for many people I think this is the best outfit for "PLAY" red and vivid flowers It also looks good with my piercing This is the last shooting [So relaxed] [Another attractive pose] [colorful poses bring endless shutter-clicks] [It's all done] [How was the Jacket Photo shooting?] It was funny because we have worked together for so long time Sujin also took a lot of beautiful photos It was really funny because they always say "Chung Ha, good job" that encourages me to work even harder I feel a lot of love from them [D-5 Performance Video Filming Set] It's been years since I came here Hello Oh, camera is here I guess this is my seat [Such an reality-show-expert] Chung Ha, look at that [What surprised her?] Wow, its awesome [D-DAY staff prepared a surprise] [So touched] I was already so moved by the hearts but here's a bigger surprise I love it [She will take the banner to her office] [We are glad to see you like it 
- D-DAY staff] Look at the dots [happy happy] [The stage is waiting for Chung Ha] [What's your plan here?] Today right before the "PLAY" release D-DAY team set a cool stage for me I have only one week to be on TV actually I wasn't supposed to go on TV even for a week under the original plan but one week is still short so we are here today to film a performance video for the first time, isn't it? Yes, for the first time the video will be released on my official channel [Please tune in] [Chung Ha striding toward the stage] [The dance team doing a run-through] [Joined the rehearsal very naturally] [Chung Ha and her team dancing together] (saying hello] [meticulously checking formation] I will go backward
and you guys go anywhere you want [The performance video filming begins] Three Two One Oh, audio wait a minitue [Oh my god] [full of laughs] You make us nervous [putting all passion she has 
to show a better performance] [Chung Ha shines more brightly on the stage] I'm so tired [What did you feel while preparing for the "PLAY" stage] Um... I thought can I handle it? because the choreography gets you out of breath BPM is so fast the notes are really high Chung Ha this time dances a lot more than last albums which I guess makes her a little bit tired [Energy up again] (Please PLAY it) [Sometimes she gets tired and exhausted] [But what always gives her energy is] [those who support and love her] [What do BYULHARANG mean to Chung Ha?] They are a really really big support for me I can't even find anything to compare rather than having Gongjindan or a restorative for the rest of my life fans' letters or their support always being on my side they give me a lot of energy they make me work harder and harder I always hope that my BYULHARANG would like the new songs they are always my No.1 priority I know I can't make everyone like me and I can't meet everyone's needs but I hope at least, my songs are not a bitter taste to most of the people I hope they feel like my songs are somehow interesting and sweet [The first verse of "PLAY" performance video
will begin soon]                                                         [The full version will be released on July 8]
