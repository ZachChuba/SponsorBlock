[Music] where are they hello hello I'm back hello yeah Hey Spanish boyfriend spend you can sit up your butt must be hurting so much wait are you in pain you have an evening weeks my god oh let it die what's up Bengt yo eat oh my god yard again we're all back I'm back yes Oh where's dinner bone gamers we're back game ours yes it feels good to be back isn't that right Oh lovely that's me defeat the last episode we defeated the Ender Dragon and boy oh boy did that feel good [Music] Gaber keg now that I'm back things are gonna become a lot more stricter no more fun and games I got a family to provide for now that's try to look how did you get there that's literally impossible all right I want to start off just building just easing into it building a little float I want to build a boat I'm gonna build a boat now thank you I somehow lost the footage of me building the boat we're just really annoying I swear I built it no creative mode no nothing I built that okay just take my word for it just imagine like a cool montage right now basically okay I'm not gonna lie that looks pretty epic I like it it's a Swedish Viking boat technically this sail is something wrong actually no it's on the right end it's hundred percent correct and just how I want it ah like if they're not it's cool stop talking stop talking we work here we don't speak embarrassing this is embarrassing so I'm gonna be honest I think technically no don't go through spent you can't come with me to the Endor now I don't it's too dangerous we're not doing it I don't even know if it's possible for a dog to go today in there you know I am sure it is possible but it's a bad idea stop Sven stop yeah I know I know you missed me but I have to go to the Ender on my own so technically for me the series is over it ended on episode 30 I want to keep it intact that way you know in terms of storytelling or whatever come back please basically what I mean by that it's just like things like there's a lot of stuff in the game I can do but I also didn't want it seem like I was stalling defeat the Ender Dragon when technically I could so I decided to just do it so so basically to explain it the series is over but the series continues its like the OVA of enemy at this point ok just see it as that we do have a lot of stuff left that it's obviously very integral to the game which is finding an end city which is what we're gonna do now all right gamers I know I know I just got back I want to find an end city which means we gotta go back ok but actually before we go to the Endor there's something I really really want to try that I haven't done because we're probably gonna travel through the air now they're a lot more now and I know the fastest way to travel the nether span that changed my mind you can't come with me let's go let's go gamers lifespan come on can I just I want ice basically but I don't know can I mind this no why not doesn't need to be pure ice what the fact is that an end of my guy I accidentally threw the ender pearl and I spawned a creep 5% chance to spawn this is a goal ender poo cool all right I've been waiting to say this for a long time that's right we're gonna head off me and my boy and find some ice just like old times man just like old times look at IKEA tower so go [ __ ] you know honeymoon is epic and all but there's nothing like going on a trip with your minecraft dog now where was the ice I forgot nothing like witnessing a sunrise with your boy god damn I miss Mike the thing is like clearly at this point it has peaked summer's over the series technically it reached his conclusion but I just want to have fun with it so damn it I'm gonna keep playing why is there a chicken here excuse me water chicken which way to ice how did you get here no you cannot get in the bug curse water chicken explain your presence you are far away from what a sheep sent you you know what our she and what was his favorite color all of them Oh what does she uh we're under attack shoosh very well you can come with this I understand you're scared oh god I'm scared too let's go I just wanted ice that's all I wanted goddamn what is she must be angry sorry you can't fit in the boat it's not my fault I'm sorry there was ice over here right there's a mushroom biome you know I said this before and I'll say it again the series ends when sweat dies Oh God which is that bird there it is the blue eggs does your name chicken cheep-cheep-cheep that's a great name oh yeah it's snowing now polar bear all right stay here sheep sheep sheep that's a great name for a chicken I got a see

gold and the polar bears gone to I guess you can come with me lame okay so I have the packed ice it's time to head back gamers damn he's fast for a polar pattern over the Minecraft ocean yeah this is where we float find the polar bear friend I said [ __ ] get in the boat on its parent tried to kill me it was a lot of drama wish he would stop crying cuz now I am his mom [Music] Hey look boat I must surely have gone here before what how'd I miss this oh my god suspicious - Sven I found suspicious - now for those of you don't know suspicious - doesn't random thing and it's just like real life if you find a suspicious do always eat it Oh anything suspicious-looking food-related always eat it here we go and I have night vision look at that pretty epic suspicious - thank you and it's gone those five seconds was epic so yeah we're gonna capture every animal in the game but we're also gonna capture every enemy in the game someone proved on the subreddit that you can actually catch the ender dragon in a boat and I'm like they did it in and they did it in creative mode though but that means it's possible where are we what is this t-then nothing like taking your polar bear for walk in the desert only in Minecraft what is this why is this here a pool on stop that hop on in polar bear more like oh god no no stop crying start Oh God he's alive there it is there's our beacon of trust I don't understand why he's resisting I'm trying to save your life stop resisting all right since you're a polar bear I guess you can live here okay time to build out our ice so I think you place them like diagonally and the boat will work on y'all this is scary like I should probably run this through a test yeah no that doesn't work so does these not have to be there Oh God Oh God but if that's how it's gonna be yeah that is that is how it works okay maybe I can be able to safety underneath or something oh god that's uncomfortable this is the worst idea ever I don't like bridges and it has nothing to do with history I honestly don't see how anyone can like them how is that there what hey hey oh stop stop aah Oh might stuff all right I guess I'll just do this now it just got to plays all the eyes wish you feel sexy bet it feels pretty good I like this now oh wow I have a lot more ice than I thought nah we're gonna go so fast that flash will have to change his name to not so fast yeah now I really don't have to keep going but I'm going anyway I want to say it how much speed we can build up here we go you ready for ultimate speed you think I was fast when I used to potion of speed or you ain't I understand you don't know if this would be here we go oh my god that was awesome oh god I feel dizzy damn now that's fast I like that that's awesome today we're actually exploring something very exciting which is an end City what their citizen in the end yes ah okay here we go gamers oh my god this is ridiculous you guys enjoying your time here you're free oh yeah you can get the I forgot okay we'll get the egg later but as you gamers can see there's something over here you thought the end was the end of Minecraft well no there's a way to go even further beyond would you guys free creeper what here we go oh man damn so if you go through here and I think you have to throw an ender pearl it's actually get in maybe there's a way to use a piston to push you down yeah wonder if that works actually I just had a gamer pee you ever had one of those to get the ender dragon egg so you can hatch your own ender dragon you got to push it with a piston and then put a torch underneath I think that was it I'm not entirely sure and I should probably double-check here goes nothing gamers okay it worked what dragon egg that's so cool and I said that in the most on a rhombic way possible dragon egg that's so cool but it's epic it's a fake alright be quiet because my question was fairly simple can you push yourself down so you don't have to use an enderpearl to go through the Ender dumb ideas come from dumb people everyone never forget II would I do yeah and then we put this here and then we can just walk through right Hey look at that I did science i dad science what is this damn it's like purple cactus whoa well I of course know what this is because I'm minecraft veteran this is space fruit can I eat it whoa that is teleported whoa so that's how you do it huh you've been snacking all along and you haven't been sharing so this is bedrock and for those who you don't know that's what happens when we no but your mom meets sorry please slight smash like on video and Bide merge big brain and we can do the same thing to go back baby remote getaway cool you should probably put a lever instead but you can't my trick Bing bong Bing Bing bong okay so excuse me have you seen your city where you come from we gotta find so let's just head in one direction south there's n cities I know there is we just gotta find them hello I wish I could bring Garrigan here what if you can make Jurgen fly that would be epic like a Pegasus listen Microsoft I'm giving you these ideas for free you understand this so I think NC is actually quite rare you gotta be careful in the end though cuz you fall down you lose all your stuff which has never happened to me of course but oh god oh god do I not like this finger very sweaty don't release your Shift key whatever you do feelings oh my god I just realizing it makes perfect sense so the nether is Netherlands right and the end is Swiss because there's cheese everywhere so what we're looking for is obviously an end city and in the end city is where we'll find the alight tram which makes it so you can fly in the game how cool is that I never use one before and I'm so excited Felix when you come back to married life what are you most excited about a light rock I what is he saying I don't know he's speaking language of gods I like try please now hello I don't like bridges I've said this before and I'll say it again I don't like bridges don't like cheese that much either to be honest so this is a double whammy I like it melt I like cheese melt that okay sorry relax it's like they they created the the nether right which is awful and then they decided hey let's make something worse in Chief's I assume n cities are as radars in other cities but you keep going in one direction you eventually find 100 that's another end portal and they're men more like n they're mad am i right I wonder what happens if I feed a chorus fruit to bang will he teleport so this is basically another way back home if we get lost yes there it is finally I walk for days I reek of cheese but I'm ready damn is that a boat why their boat damn that's huge dude oh god I'm about to level up but ah then I won't be level 69 anymore oh yeah that is so cool hold on let me get it footers that is sick they're like why is this creeper here and why does he look so sexy hey I don't like bridges don't like them very much because crossing bridges it's very tough things can happen things can happen Oh No Oh God made a lot of mistakes on bridges in the past so therefore I try to cross bridges very fast oh god I ran out I nailed it dumbass cheese cheese is so dumb it's the dumbest thing okay here we go whoa yes those I I've been meaning to ah nope stop stop it's conduits stop stop shield haha oh yeah he'll the city at the end of the game hello oh my god it's a thing what I'm flying why am i flying oh they're making me fart it all makes sense oh stop I kind of low-key don't want to fly though okay fine I guess I'm flying so these stop I think these are light sources and rod all the rods alright I've seen what people use those for ok gamers were in all right let's go please they teleport it they are actually farting seriously mine cried Oh got him and you're up - ulka she'll actually I'll accept your farts shoot me yeah ah yes but yeah yeah you made one big miss a you made one that's right I'm so close to not be

stop are they're shooting each other I'm done now ah no stop whoa and inches in the end man ah stop and their part I'm going in god damn this race is a lot more dangerous than I thought are they teleport the snakes so I think you can make something with a shulker shell guess we'll have to do it later this is not stop burning all right let's see what's it Oh and entered diamonds Oh efficiency for mending fortune what that's awesome alright I'll put that in there how convenient I could put the dragon in that's alright we go gamers that's really good loot here has anyone made the farting
