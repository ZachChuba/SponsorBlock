[Music] thanks to my patrons and since this educational video is likely to be demonetised cuz YouTube doesn't support educational content anymore linked below hey cypher here see no evil the Moors Murders is an odd one for me to cover on this channel it's a two-part miniseries made for British television and a true crime story at that both are things I tend to avoid well it comes by patron request and it was surprisingly good to watch when Tyler told me about this film subject matter he said it was as big as the Manson murders for England and it's pretty much unknown history in the US and that was an apt description I'd never heard of the Moors Murders before this and they really are that kind of sensational in the UK [Music] Ian Brady and Myra Hindley got together in the early 1960s as a couple they were into some sick stuff like the Nazis Marquis de Sade's writings and deeds like the guy who is the origin of the word sadism you know stuff like that Brady pushed these ideas as a form of release including murder which they eventually turned to the first was a girl they knew named Pauline Reade where they abducted her Brady brutalized her and killed her then they disposed of the body on the moors this pattern was repeated at least three more times and they even began recording certain parts during all this Hindley had an affair with a cop talking about becoming one and there's a bunch of other little things like that this is all pretty crazy stuff but the fifth victim is where they got caught Hindley and her sister Maureen were close so Brady started befriended Maureen's husband David Smith Smith had a long record of violence and robbery so they conspired to rob a bank but Brady and Hindley had different plans they kidnapped another victim named Edward Evans in the middle of the night Hindley brought Smith to their house and watched as Brady murdered the 17 year old Smith helped clean up the mess before running home after fearfully wading through the night Smith and Maureen reported the murder to the police in person the following morning the police arrested Brady after finding the body in their upstairs bedroom they eventually found some suitcases that he was hiding elsewhere full of incriminating evidence which proved Hindley's involvement as well so she was arrested after much searching of the Moores they found the bodies of Lesley Ann downy and Jon killbride Brady was charged with the murder of the three provable ones and Hindley with somewhat lesser crimes both of them were not given a tariff for how long their imprisonment would be since Britton had recently abolished the death penalty this was essentially life imprisonment without the possibility of parole though for a long time their home secretary could basically commute those sentences Britain's whole system has the possibility of changing at whim and so these kinds of administrative things get shuffled around quite a bit all the time well after decades of sensational coverage which destroyed Maureen and David Smith's lives in the process Hindley finally admitted to greater involvement in the murders and kicked off another investigation to find the bodies of Pauline Reade and another boy named Keith Bennett they found reed in 1987 but couldn't find Bennett he still buried somewhere in the Moore's Brady and Hindley died in prison despite Lord Longford trying to get Hindley released for years on end this is quite a sensational thing in the UK and probably because of that this episode is going to get in TV monetized because you know YouTube doesn't value educational content anyways one analysis said the media response to these appalling crimes created a template for future media responses to serial killers through the ever-present police mug shots reproduced at various intervals in media Brady and Hindley continue to stare out of the past into the present the audience gazes back in fascination long after the event the Moors Murders became much like other serial killers in the US where people are constantly writing about them they've never really gone out of the spotlight and Hindley in particular has often been used as a symbol of evil like here are just a few times she's been mentioned in media take me to the mall - I lay me down [Music] [Music] a pop he's always looking for trouble the new single by blouses a song of love tomorrow only [Music] hello would you like boiled sweets so yeah it's actually kind of fascinating how much people in the UK remember these things in general true-crime is kind of a historical genre unto itself is a cottage industry dating back to at least sensational news coverage of late 18th century mass murderers or what are now called serial killers such as the Harpe brothers or possibly earlier than that with 17th century coverage of highwayman it's also the progenitor of the incredibly popular detective genre Edgar Allen Poe's the mystery of Murray Roche he tried to solve an actual murder through fiction Poe's fictional detective dupa was the template for Arthur Conan Doyle's more famous character Sherlock Holmes so true crime and fiction are often inter woven and as you can guess quite the moneymaker people just love hearing about these ghastly crimes there's a lot of psychology and sociology work done on just the public's fascination with criminals and theories just abound I find that far more interesting than the killers themselves though there's also apparel since such coverage can give the impetus for further crimes this is especially the case with Brady and Hindley their popularity has been cited as the reason for a couple subsequent serial killers it's a bit of a platitude to say that violence breeds violence but it's more sensational coverage of violence will inspire copycats what really helped this case in popularity was the involvement of a woman whereas previous cases during the TV era and Britain had all been men but in 1965 Hindley and Brady were a perfect storm of coverage then there was also the fact that they weren't executed so people continued to pay attention to them through regular interviews some authors managed to gain access to a great deal of data unlike other topics where the history is already rung quite dry there's still much more to dig into meta and physically professional historians generally don't bother with the true crime genre including myself instead looking for greater contextual information but that also means that the barrier to entry for this topic is pretty low and so many people want to get in on it now with podcasters and what-have-you Hindley and Brady will probably never cease to stare out of the past into the present so this series had a lot to go off of in 2006 there has been some new stuff but generally nothing that they really need to worry about funny enough Ian Brady himself actually tried to sue to make this movie not happen but that failed all in all it's pretty dang good it must have been tempting to tell the story from the perspective of Hindley or have a God's eye view but instead it's mostly told through Dave Smith which i think is a pretty savvy move he only witnessed one murder and therefore the audience doesn't have to be subjected to the horror of the rest the only other perspective is one of the detectives which I mean of course that's a smart thing to do so they narrowed down the subject matter quite well in a way that specifically avoids sensationalism and a focus on the grotesque instead it's more of a procedural yet they managed to mention some of the really weird stuff too but only in a passing sense like Marquis de Sade and the Nazi references there's even some coverage of how badly this destroyed the Smiths like this is some competent storytelling to keep these things within the plot without resorting to fiction at least for the most part and by keeping it within these perspectives we avoid the sensationalism that could be seriously hurt --fill there's also plenty of quotes that make it clear they stuck very close to the material I've got nothing to say my version of events of my evening have exactly the same as aliens version of events it's fantastic there are inaccuracy but they don't affect the narrative in any significant way [Music] most of the inaccuracies are merely time compression or character amalgamation like they have the lead detective find John kill Brides body that was one of the many people poking rods into the ground in the area after a photographer figured out the general position and obviously they dug him out a lot more professionally than with the detectives bare hands or they show one of the victim's parents beating up the Smiths Dave Smith was beaten and Maureen constantly threatened some of the parents made regular threats to Brady and Hindley including going so far as to assault police escorts in fact this seems to replicate something that actually happened though they weren't breaking in like as shown so yeah this is basically amalgamation and generally good I think the parents thing could have been handled it a little better but so be it there's also a couple times where they simply try to add a little more tension in a way that doesn't actually matter like how they have Lesley Ann Downey found right before the search is about to be called off if there is a tomorrow I don't think OHS can let us go in there any longer I don't think so sir it was nowhere close to the line there and finally the one that kinda struck me as odd ly out of place Brady just randomly kills a sheep on the moors while they're picnicking I haven't seen anyone claiming this and that kind of disrupts the narrative a little you see Smith is supposed to disbelieve that Brady is capable of killing people could a never killed anyone oh yeah three or four so you talk hey do you believe me he told me it killed before but him believing but it's not too much of a step beyond to go from maliciousness towards sheep to maliciousness towards humans so that whole part is somewhat disrupted but it's really only if you think about it that's the kind of minutiae that could have easily happened in reality and no one was the wiser so either way see no evil is a good miniseries I'm not really one for true crime stuff but this was a nice diversion into something I didn't have a clue about and nice to find the series isn't peddling a bunch of malignant theories like zodiac see no evil manages to tell a good story in a very different channel unlike YouTube my cat has attacked my foot [Music] you
