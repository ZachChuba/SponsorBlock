like how I paid off fifty thousand dollars in student debt by giving up my daily latte they made me feel like a failure and we're terrible when figuring out how to deal with money stress but now I can only assume that the people writing these were imaginary because even if the loan had no interest it would still take decades to pay off this decay with latte money and we're still pretending everyone who has debt or can't afford to buy a house must be throwing their money away on selfish indulgences and if they could only break the habit they'd be millionaires avocado toast is just the new latte the inexpensive indulgences that somehow gives people permission to judge you and your life choices no one should feel ashamed for spending a few bucks on themselves from time to time maybe don't spend all your disposable income on avocado toast or lattes but don't be so strict with yourself that you don't enjoy anything either deciding what's important to you and making room for it in your budget will help you actually stick to your budget and learn how to deal with money stress here are eight things I used to feel guilty spending money on but now I don't number one avocado toast and lattes obviously I don't know anyone who goes to a coffee shop for a latte or avocado toast simply because they're too lazy to make those things at home they have a meeting or they need the office space to work on a side hustle $4 is your table rent and bonus you get to eat something healthier than a donut in tastier than water or it's a special treat a four dollar snack is way more affordable than a lot of other things I buy to treat myself like the beautiful cookbooks I never use number two going out this is the one I have the hardest time with because I love drinking beer with friends and I live in a town filled with breweries but going to movies eating out or going to a bar is so much more expensive than having friends over for the same thing so yeah have some go two ways of entertaining that don't require a ton of money but don't avoid experiences you love altogether treat these dates with your Esso friends and yourself like the fun indulgences that they are and really enjoy them number three full price clothing I love a good deal but sometimes sales trick me into buying things I don't need or even really want when you can get something you love for a good price that's the best but sometimes you need a pair of pants that actually fit or shoes that don't hurt your feet or a dress that makes you feel awesome and has pockets and of all of the things you spend money on clothing is one of the best deals when you break it down by cost per use I have $100 pair of jeans that I live in they cost me more than I was hoping to spend but I've never thought about that during any of the hundreds of times I've worn them number four anything for your health or well-being take care of yourself it's so much more expensive and miserable in the long run not to paying for a doctor visit sucks but missing work and friends because you're really sick sucks even more and sometimes spending money for your health and safety means buying adorable snow boots so you don't get frostbite and trust me snow boots are way more fun than frostbite number five vacations I've realized that I feel sheepish about travel and time off work I'm always quick to point out what a great deal I got because I'm afraid people are judging me for being indulgent but honestly when someone I work with once time off especially for a trip I'm so excited for them time away from work makes you more productive and better to be around plus I love planning and saving for a vacation almost as much as I love being on vacation so it's very much worth it number six art collecting do you want the lowest pressure buying experience ever buy art from artists you like this is one of those things that seems like it would just be for the very wealthy but artists need to make a living too so most working artists have affordable pieces for the rest of us you might not be able to afford every piece of art you fall in love with I doubt you'll ever regret buying something that makes you happy to have in your home and if you support artists locally you might even make friends and get invited to cool events number seven my passions I love to make things and ride my bike so I make room for those things in my life I make videos and a podcast and I have a couple of bikes that I love like some people love their pets I've saved up and shopped around and I buy used when I can I also coordinate with friends to share and trade equipment or to buy their old bikes number eight charitable donations you don't have to be well-off to give money to causes that are important to you I sometimes get overwhelmed by all the crowdfunding campaigns and fundraisers there in my community so I set a pretty strict monthly budget forgiving I also like to combine this one with the other little indulgences that I love lots of nonprofits will host art auctions as fundraisers and sometimes breweries will donate to a cause for every beer bot on a certain night this is just my list yours may be different but if something is important to you that's a good enough reason to make room for it in your life no judgment whatever you're passionate
