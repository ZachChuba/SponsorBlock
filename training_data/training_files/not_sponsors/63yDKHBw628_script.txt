the Muellers name is an acronym for massive unidentified terrestrial organism in one of the original screenplays for Godzilla the Mutis were called hawk Muto and femme Muto which was short for Hokkaido Muto and female Muto altogether there are four meters that exist in the monster verse in a 2014 film the mirrors are referred to as such but are also referred to numerically with a male being designated as muta 1 and female as muta to the third meter is therefore presumably known to monarch as muted free the murals are an ancient parasitic arthropod species that evolved during the Permian period of Earth's history technically the Muellers are a part of the smallest subspecies of the much larger muta prime like Godzilla they feed off of the Earth's radiation let's dive on to the four types of Mutis muta one the male being the first member to be encountered is described as a young growing and looking for food before meeting the female so he consumes a radiation to gain strength this mural is seen to be 200 feet tall and probably weighed in the 10,000 ton range numerous bodies are covered in an iridescent metallic grayish black exoskeleton they have orange red narrowly shaped eyes the shape of the head is reminiscent of gaius and they have triangular jaws resembling a hooked beak with the male Muto having two mana bells while the female only has one the male Muto is able to unleash electromagnetic pulses from its claws which can disable electric up artists in a five-mile wide radius the male mural has wings which it can use the flyer on the air at a stop speeds is undetermined naturally these wings aid him in seeking out radiation to offer to the female the wings also gave the male a massive combat advantage against Godzilla he would usually be able to escape back into the skies before Godzilla could retaliate the male spend most of his time after hatching flying around in a constant hunt for radiation and most importantly the potential mate the male muta was strong enough to drag Godzilla away from the female muta without difficulty and dredge up a Russian attack submarine from the depths of the ocean and pull it dozens of miles inland on the Island of Hawaii Muto - the female once the male have matured enough awake adamancy in Traverse to Las Vegas and other environments to meet with the male she is seen as having eight limbs although only six were used for walking around the female muta was larger than the main muta being around 300 feet tall and weigh heavy and also bulk bulkier in appearance she lacks the ability to fly but is durable enough to withstand even the atomic breath of the g-man despite their resemblances to ultra cuts the mirrors are of vertebrate biology the female is twice as large as the male but lacks the wings like five flies and seven was the female Muto has the ability to reproduce sexually she lays hundreds of X near radioactive object so that when the offsprings hatch they can immediately feed off the radiation as parasites the females of the mutabrid the species lays their eggs inside the radioactive carcasses of the large of Godzilla species in order to reproduce the Muto's have shown to be intelligent enough to work as a team and the female was also able to quickly determine false involvement in the destroying of a nest muta prime even bigger than the female muta or maybe even bigger than godzilla himself muta prime is portrayed as another subspecies a more ancient one that have battled an ancient ancestor of Godzilla and actually won the fight she might be almost all around 400 feet tall the muta prime is nearly identical in appearance to the regular female Muto except for several notable differences the muta prime has a hardened outer shell with razor sharp back spires on it large orange glowing volumes as well as several smaller pairs of four limbs on her chest the muta Prime is classified as having the behavior of a destroyer she also appears to have some sort of rivalry with Godzilla muta prime is only seen attacking humans in order to obtain sources of radiation and doesn't seem to kill out of pure malice jinchen mushi is an imposing specimen would raise his sharp back spires towering atop a hot and outer shell making it an unstoppable mountain of a time as erupts from the earth powerful legs strike the ground like a devastating seismic salvo of cannons heard for miles with each tundra stub digging into the earth to take a battle-hardened stance on the surface against any tightened aggressor it faces muta tree the second female muta is among the tightest being monitored by Mona and has awakened by Ghidorah skal she is later seen in Boston after Godzilla defeats Ghidorah and she boughs down to Godzilla acknowledging him as a new alpha this new muta of the very similar to the female mutant in the 2014 film bears slight differences which brings up a question whether she is a juvenile form of the muta prime it hasn't been stated as yet but it's popular fan believe that this mirror is a subspecies akin to the muta prime of Godzilla after-show not much is known about this Muto except for the fact that she was in North America and attacked cities and human settlements there she was also quick enough to reach Boston at the end anyway do tell us your thoughts in the comment section and what videos you want us to make like share subscribe and all that fun stuff
