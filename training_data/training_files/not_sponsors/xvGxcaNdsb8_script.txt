there No a minute back holy [ __ ] okay so much [ __ ] dude that is so much did I tell you I hate shotguns yet I hate [ __ ] shotguns near the end of season eight I decided it was finally time for me to take this Andy PvP just a little bit more serious than I had in the past and back then I thought what would be a better way to do that than to grind them next rank in the competitive playlist sounds easy enough right oh no this map this is one of the new maps for don't quote me oh yeah look at that TV three one-night mesh this is my squad 3-1 best captains this is my squad voice I don't know however this game Oh works by the way that's not where they can come from I don't know where to go oh it's just like virtually destroy type of thing I guess we want to protect heavy sword off oh yeah oh yeah baby yeah we're all fire voice were fire I gotta say not a bad nap this is gonna be where the fun starts because now everybody's gonna have their supers that's what I mean Oh didn't I okay I didn't know there was another guy that's the only reason I play middle three just to [ __ ] other supers up I don't know how to use super for myself did I just hit the back on my teammate there doubled up on the body just like the pros that was a head though can I tell you about our hundred eyes playing the game let's guy for the YouTube content know what he didn't die I'm I'm upset I like this guy this guy got the double but the recluse mountaintop what a true gamer he is all right we got this all right I need to snipe for that nope missing the first shot like a true gamer oh no I'm out of ammo oh that is so unlucky that is so unlucky okay so we won see we just need a birdie more of those games and then we got 5500 comp it was easy enough at the lower ranks for sure this was just at the start of the day and to make matters more interesting I also decided to team up with my good friend sleepy who was very excited to play competitive with me I am NOT ready you're not ready I'm not ready alright then change your gear oh no I know no just go are you ready okay I'm ready not mentally but I'm ready why is your ape not censored but - that's a good question sleepy your ape isn't

please switch the bottom three striker and equip to cease no matter who loves me - one hit melee players now I can't say that I didn't see his arguments but you know you gotta look at it from both sides on my site I would say that missile Titan is a lot more fun to play on the other side my super said they had not been great up until that point some thickness what did my super do there [Music]

kept disconnecting at crucial moments in a lot of games so after a while I simply decided to try out the solo queue again because I was just tired of losing like that this map again huh oh [ __ ] that's a player okay that's another player okay let's try and say with the team and I want to disappoint big boy Yoshi that's that's the enemy yeah I don't know what's going on big boy Yoshi has disappointed me still winnable show me what you got Yoshi goodbye Yoshi and goodbye to you too that's a bad first round yeah there's some reason playing from this often that feels easier for me as I said he's bumped there I thought that that's my side of the map you know what this time some EPS pretty good too that was such a bad plate that was such a bad play oh okay another round that's a good start meadow kami how did I miss two shots off the hand cannon there are no guys teabagging two teammates with a nice oops again not that I'm allowed to say anything about that though oh my god that's what you get for tea bagging bro take a closer look at that what okay no problem one of them left teammates could probably finish it go pro oh no oh no this happening [Music] though it's pretty toxic that it's like the so many time I've used the Oakland last guy alive now I actually have a lot of games where I used my super to finish off the last guy in a 1v1 and I regret none of it here's the thing though because sleepy also still wanted to get the next rank this season he started queuing up in the solo queue as well and as you can probably already guess what happened next I ended up in a game with sleepy except this time he was on the other team [Music] good job teammates oh never looks sleepy on the other team yeah it is I didn't even realize man asleep you got bullied well since this opportunity doesn't present itself every day you don't already know what I'm gonna do right oh what you're doing in the floor man what you're doing on the floor taking a nap already waits around this is over yes all right we're already leading by two oh the game can't end this quick I need to kill sleepy at least a few more times oh this is my chance he wanted me not to play that is just content right there okay that was a good snipe goodbye sleepy oh [ __ ] we're actually losing this round of course sleepy steamin is using that wanted kill [ __ ] of course of course okay let's not

out the losers okay and I missed a traitor's got sniped gonna be behind I got it bad you think I filled yeah part of life yes I can't die I have to use it I died Bubba damaged shipping now at this point I got pretty close to reaching the Mex rank and seeing sleepy steelhead connection issues I guess our Pat's split once more because you know I was just gonna play more solo resulting in enough points to be just one game away from getting to max rank so what do I do i queue up and well I'm just gonna show you this game because this is quite the game to watch whoo here we go that's not enough [ __ ] off that's a great start that's what we need that's a shotgun player he just he just zoomed man he was way too fast I did not expect that [Music] already on the lives the [ __ ] happens told you were winning that I really gonna figure out how to play against pulses Blanche is just insane never mind that's how you play against bolsters voice that's how you play against pulses one more guy rise please don't tell me I wasted my alter note still have it no need to worry I'm gonna try to help my teammates [Music] this guy just keeps [ __ ] me with a shotgun [Music] no one types insane savants box the one taps Oh oh my god and killing the hammer oh my god dude it's this round this round no no and I can't hit I can't hit the grenades I can hit players but not the grenade yeah that was a scout that was that was the wrong way to go oh my god the Nate's this guy with the shotgun again I always worth it but uh [ __ ] he deserved it again a pika door no no I was about to say if I don't get that kill I'm gonna be very upset [Music] hey okay he's got another sin shot oh no we weren't in such a good spot you know they have another son shot as well this is it show me what you've got [Music] No oh my god dude at least I got the neck sorry Gangrel after losing that won't be won in an incredibly stupid way I got just a little bit tilted and I went on a decent losing streak this was also when a lot of players started getting on and a lot of players actually start to streams like me but they'll get me wrong that's not a bad thing per se in fact most of the stream snipers as I'll show you right now we're actually pretty kind and basically carried me through the game if they ended up being on my team [Music] that's a grenade launcher Lexi I just feel like my teammates are killing them I'm just like here I'm just spectator you know to me yeah let's go dude let's go thanks for the win brother but of course as good as they wear on my team they were also just as good when they were on the opposing team [Music] [Music] [Music] Ryan actually has a vagina even though it might have not been their intention this put me in a place where whatever I did didn't really have a lot of influence over the outcome of a game I'd either just get carried or I just get destroyed and no matter how well I played no matter how well I put myself together I simply couldn't change the outcome of the game pull up to you over his fire oh oh that was big that was big that was big what's he doing oh my there's no way I just kill everybody there that was a headshot on every okay after 13 hours of playing and trying and failing I was getting tired and it is start to say that at this point my performance was declining very rapidly I don't know what that wall was to easy routes easy life wait it's not over yet I know they're gonna that's the ceiling no oh my god okay I couldn't shoot the first sign oh my god no one all clip death I was still reloading and it threw me off so much oh my god like I got thrown off by the rhythm because the first one didn't what no I wouldn't okay but anybody clips that you're bent okay you're bent eventually though sleepy came back with another friend who goes by the name of 2-inch terror and they came back to basically carry me through those last few 100 points that I just didn't seem to be able to get pretend as I was just one game away we matched up against the sweatiest team ever these guys are like semi swats it was good no doubt how's that first fight alright up right there I bought it up pushing with Jim push me they're spawning
