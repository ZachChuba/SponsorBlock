this week rag and myself have three hours to make hardcore iron men and keep them in pvp worlds on top of this we're also going to be ultimate iron man so we cannot bank if we die we lose a gear piece at the fight and if we die after that again we lose a piece of food for the final fight as well i absolutely love them and use them daily now animals are you kidding me bees and geez of super sad hey guys and welcome to my hardcore ironman progress video in this episode we are just starting out my account is named lame idea link we are a hardcore ultimate ironman pvp challenge only account holy [ __ ] that's mouthful but just kidding we're actually going to play for three hours to beat link in the final fight that's the video can't wait to hop into it guys now i know magic and or going down the waterfall route is probably the meta it's probably the most streamlined approach you can do when doing these sort of new account challenges but to be honest i'm sick of doing that i want to do something a bit different i want to try to go a range mage hybrid range is decent dps as long as he's not rocking like full addy or something and even if he does buy that his food is probably gonna be a bit slacking but i don't know there's probably many ways to make some money in these three hours so who really knows but three hours isn't a crazy amount of time so i figured i could rush range get a lot of range levels and also maybe get 13 magic as like a 2h so range main hand to fire strike as like a two wage sort of thing to get them to eat a lot freak them out a bit keep them eating the more time he's eating the more dps i can get on him and um yeah there's many ways to approach this but i've never really gone range really early on i don't think or if i have it's been such a while that i don't even remember it so that's what we're gonna do guys so let's start the timer and do the stronghold because that's how we're gonna kick this off because we need that 10k to what you block dude your hat is massive bro i mean i feel like with my name people know who i am or maybe they think i'm link link never changes his character though first of all this guy's probably gonna try to kill me this [ __ ] over here and i guarantee link has no [ __ ] creativity and his character looks exactly like his main with that dumb hairstyle he has all right we are officially in the danger zone guys officially in the dangers but i want to go claim from the range tutor first get this stuff um i mean the quick i guess what are the stats on this thing i guess it's just bronze arrows isn't it okay i also want to get some coins really quick so i'm gonna sell some [ __ ] i don't need uh wooden shields i mean yeah we just need some wines they're like one gp each or something even if i only need one wine two wines that's fine i just want enough food to run to the stronghold so i don't die that's essentially what i'm doing right now i'm going to buy wines and going right to the strongholds getting my 10k then to buy a bunch of arrows and then just start training and getting my range up as much as possible the 13 magic shouldn't take any time at all i'm not going to even worry about that now i'm not going to have it on my head i'm just gonna focus on getting my range up as fast as possible and trading in a spot that's very discreet so i don't die hello bees and geez so three hours as hardcore ultimate iron man in pvp worlds we've got three hours to go so i'm going to start this timer and we are going to jump straight into my plan because i have a i think a pretty decent plan uh the first thing i'm going to do is start pickpocketing the men right here so let's uh pickpocket the man and hopefully get ourselves just a little bit of gp together um before we have to eat this is going very very well wow i didn't think it was going to go that well there's 12 gp straight away okay i got myself together 27 gp we're gonna head on over to ned now and grab ourselves some rope because we need it for the quest we're gonna be doing and then we also need to grab ourselves two earth runes here one gp to spare absolutely awesome then we need to get ourselves to edgeville i'm probably gonna go the slow way round just in case there's any pk's up here um i know it's only 3 to 18 that can kill me but still i don't know not really looking forward to that hopefully draenor is relative safe spot only level 18s can attack me guess that's not so bad right now but of course as i level up that gets worse and worse and we just bought five jugs of wine for i don't even know how much gp i had actually totally forgot but either way it was like no gp at all so let's go right to the stronghold dip up north and uh let's just get that 10k and there we go guys we now have the fancy boots of course they fit our flared trousers perfectly i'm already going the wrong way we want to go to varrock because now we want to get all of our equipment all of our bows all of our armor that we're gonna wear um and then just go train it's gonna be a lot of training and as i'm training i'm gonna see how fast slow it is and we will just kind of assess as we go because i have no idea how long like 30 range takes for example we'll see all right lo hook us up hook a brother up with some stuff okay so like i said we're just gonna buy the bow types and i'm just gonna stick with bronze arrows all the way through i don't really know when it goes up in price though i definitely don't want to be spending 2 gp so i'm going to hop throughout the worlds a bit there's not that many pvp challenge worlds pvp challenge world there's not that many pvp worlds in general the american one scares me a bit because it is 12 12 p.m on a sunday right now but again only level 18 can attack me so i'll probably just buy 150 in every pvp world and then we'll just start training and if we have to come back i'll do that i want as much money for food as i can possibly have towards the end so that's why i'm being extremely cheap right now decided to just go for the quick way anyway um it looks like we're gonna be okay actually doesn't look like anyone's around so we just need to get over there and then we can get ourselves to ardy and then i'll feel a lot safer over in rd than i do uh around these sort of areas pull the lever yes i'm brave and let's get out of here boom boom boom because we could get attacked by up to a level 69 here that would not have been fun but we're an rd absolutely awesome okay i just sold a few things to the uh general store in rd just to free up some space and grab a little bit of gp gonna use a little bit of game knowledge here which is pickpocketing no fingers who drops or gives us triangle sandwiches which actually heals six hp and uh it seems like the uh the the rate of which you pickpocket him seems to be pretty good here i'd say yeah it looks like we're getting them quite quickly actually so uh it doesn't really matter if he catches us as well because we can just eat the triangle sandwich that he's given me now in terms of our ranged gear um oh you can't buy normal leather here that's quite annoying actually do you want to drop so much unstudded chaps i guess i could always sell them back for a little bit of coins i don't know how many get normal chaps [ __ ] i mean it's not like those are that great anyway but of course everything helps but i'm gonna go kill cows by falador we have 475 bronze arrows so i do think it should be all right maybe we'll even start with chickens because there's chickens there as well chickens then cows well i just got pk'd i just got pk [ __ ] sake dude oh my gosh that's just infuriating honestly okay i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to make money i'm gonna have to make money so let's thieve let's try to get some thieving we'll get some money together and uh just keep the same plan keep the same plan [ __ ] dude that's so annoying that is so annoying actually change of plans we're gonna sell the studded chaps back that might have been my saving grace buying that because i mean we now have 489 gp as if that's a lot so we're gonna buy some bows back and also pick up the leather top again oh man i need a normal short bow and we can't bank anything which absolutely sucks uh we need a willow as well we can also sell those back um these are still kind of bought out probably from me we're just gonna go with a hundred we gotta start training range but i'm just so broke now and this should be good enough food to get me through waterfall quest as well which is the quest we're going to be doing okay this is the bit where we could die so let's take these off drop that drop that and i think we've got to drop these as well don't we okay that should be good so if we use this on here yeah we're going to get in i'm just going to take this nice and slow get the aggro of a zombie thank you let's eat nice i don't know what is max is make sure we don't get the aggro of this moss giant okay cool we've got the amulet cool get in here grab the aggro the zombie and we should be good this one we really need to take slow didn't grab the aggro oh i don't want to risk that i really don't want to risk that zombie please attack me okay i guess we're attacking the zombie then aren't we come on lovely don't want to go out of its uh field of being able to attack me there we go let's run it go around here search the two okay cool we if he can he he can one hit me so i just don't even want to take one hit to be honest oh come on move move bro there we go there's the zombie very nice that should be us safe and done oh like this is everything i have on the account but i need to start getting levels we're already 24 minutes in and a huge disadvantage oh my gosh look how many i burnt wow okay so we're pretty much out of arrows we have nine left and we are only seven range let's get eight real quick i think we're really close one xp away so let's get eight range uh my shift drop isn't on crap we definitely want that on so there's eight range and we have some food so we need to get money now that's a huge concern for us we gotta get money because we're gonna need food at the end i don't wanna go with wines i mean they're not a bad food but there's so much better food to get um so i'm thinking of going into the wildy and just simply picking up some stuff off the ground uh actually we'd probably need a little bit more food so let's use the remaining five arrows we have get as many cooked meat as we can and head to the wheels and try to loot some stuff when you're killing the cow you run out of arrows and you took more damage than you would have gotten anyway from the cow okay that kind of backfired but we we need money so we're gonna just have to kind of send it in the wilderness and hope this works out we'll also cook these last two pieces of meat and uh take it from there dude i feel like i'm playing frogger right now i decided to go for the steel plate legs instead of the plate body because the plate body is kind of far up and i don't need a crazy amount of money right now um i believe it's in this corner and the steel plate legs it's like this is going to be disastrous dude go let's go let's go let's go let's go oh we got it we got it we got it we got it we got it okay now we gotta log out um to the other three pvp worlds hope we don't die i mean we shouldn't die but hopefully we are able just to pick it up with ease and not be stressing about this there's only four we can get again i'm not gonna go really deep it's just too far and i feel like i don't need that much money it's just it's just way too far for what it's worth um i definitely just want some quick gps right now one more part of this quest we could die by the fire giants they can hit 11's so we need to be careful for that but other than that i think we will be good let's grab all of that and we have everything we need nice okay here we go we uh don't want to take too much aggro here but there's a four nice i don't know what these guys can hit they're level 45 i'm probably just going to stay at full hp here let's search the crate and we get the key nice and it's the fire giants i'm really worried about they're the ones i'm really worried about because they can hit an 11 and that means dead straight away so i'm gonna try and get the aggro of one of the spiders [ __ ] yeah go go go go go go go go okay don't kill me please don't kill me please don't kill me yes that did not go to plan but it worked it worked wow took a zero and a one was that from the fire giant crazy okay so now we need to put these on each of the like sort of alter pillar things and then we are done with the quest and we finally have a little bit of combat stats boom there we go absolutely awesome getting ourselves some mid-seas which we can sell 30 strength 30 attack straight off the bat okay i think i am going to home telly now yeah let's do it home telly and get ourselves sorted with some stuff okay so we are a little bit more dangerous now up to level 37 can kill us but we're gonna go ahead and sell that and hop to a different pvp world and sell another one and that way we have 2.8 k i think i'm also going to sell these miffle seeds off they uh high out for a decent amount of money so we're probably we won't get anywhere near this amount of money but if we look at it they hire out for each so if i go to this uh general store see what they're going to buy them for maybe we can sell like 10 a world or something and hopefully get a decent amount of money together so 80 coins each if i sell five how much are they gonna buy for now or 50 coins i'll probably just sell five to each pvp world and keep a few uh just to get a little bit of money together so we can buy some stuff grab the last one that's four plate legs now we just run out of here no way these guys can hit tens okay so i know i could go to algorithm get more for this but the thing is is that it's going to take too long to walk all the way down there i'll happily take 400 per each i really just want to get my hands on some bronze arrows right now that's my only only concern um so we're gonna hop to all four worlds sell them and then go back to the rain shop hop through all four worlds and just buy a bunch of bronze arrows awesome 700 bronze arrows so we are heading back to falador i didn't die there before i'm seeing these people everywhere which is always freaking me out um faldor just seems like a very safe place to do let's kill those cows i'll probably camp there till like 25 range so let's hope 700 bronze arrows is enough then i can make my way back buy more again because i just don't want to waste too much money on them um they will restock as i'm killing them all right this should be 20 range this means we can now rock the willow short bow we could just drop the oak um now that whole magic plan i had where i want to do like the mage as sort of the ko2h potential unfortunately i don't think it's going to be that applicable now because of the whole situation i've been where i lost my whole cash stack um but i'm thinking about doing witch's potion as well as im catcher because it does give me some magic levels i could still go down that route if i want but the main reason is that it will give me some magic defense as well as an amulet of accuracy um both could definitely help me out in the fight if he goes magic especially if he goes magic i should say um both quests i don't think will take too long killing the imps might take a while but i can also train range in the process i'll go to karamja for that um all the materials for the witch's potion are actually really close to me and the quest star is really close to me as well in remington so i think i'm gonna go do that right now i gotta pick up an onion and i have new gotta kill a rat and also burnt meat which i have plenty of right now um i you burn so much meat even at 11 cooking it's absolutely ridiculous but let's get all the materials we need should be able to bash out witch's potion in like a few minutes and then the imp one might take a while but again we could still get range xp in the process but 20 range six prayer hopefully we can get at least eight that should be possible okay and now with that gp we can get ourselves an addie sword i'm getting an ali sword because it's quicker than an adi long sword so uh the dps is more with one of them that's why we've gone for it and then we're gonna head on over to barbarian village and start attacking minor tours i think i think it's a fairly safe place to go um and if we can get ourselves up to 30 defense then i can buy myself an addie full helm if we don't we'll get like a myth or something and then we'll just monitor it and if i'm getting really close and i get 30 defense and i've got a bit of time i'll probably do the um stronghold of security get myself 10k on top of however much you know we'll get from killing minotaurs because they can drop a decent amount of gp then we could turn up with full addy or at least uh a decent amount of addie so uh yeah that's the plan we will see what's gonna happen but hopefully we turn from a noob into a little bit less of a noob after this uh few hours of training okay so i've gone for the middle room in case anyone just like comes down the ladder they won't actually be able to see me they'll uh hopefully go to the lower levels thinking people are going to be down there rather than here so we're going to be here we've got a little bit of food i don't know what i'll do if i run out of food i haven't really thought that far ahead i'll probably um go and get cakes or something but hopefully oh my god hopefully i don't know what that max hit is oh [ __ ] oh my god i thought that was a triangle sandwich i thought that was a triangle sandwich that could have ended in tears there b's and g's um as i was saying hopefully we just get defense levels so quickly that they just stop hitting me and i don't need to worry about the food but we'll see and i've just wasted a flower which is very annoying i'm pretty sure there's some beef up here yeah cooked meat so we'll uh we'll take these and they will heal us to start with a couple of these should probably do me to be honest um maybe i'll grab a beer as well because they heal one hp yeah [ __ ] it okay we got a load of drops to sell so i'm just going to go ahead and probably just sell all these to be honest uh sell that as well takes us to a little bit of money oh there's pika i don't know what level he was level 41s can attack me now so it is a little bit dangerous that took like a minute and a half to do do i just never i think i gotta talk to you found everything yes awesome make that disgusting looking potion and give me that what is it for magic i guess it's totally worth it considering how quick it was right guys i'm gonna cut my losses i've killed 16 of them all the beads are 1 in 25 drop and i haven't gotten one yet so what i'm gonna do is i think i'm just gonna go kill hill giants um with what i have right now because they do drop some iron equipment i could probably just sell to the ge not the ge sorry the general store and i could just buy my arrows back i have an hour and 11 minutes that whole magic plan is is a bit scuff but i really need to focus on getting 30 range and hopefully some defense levels and hopefully that i'll be able to afford just like studded um i forgot to pick up that normal body i want to pick that up as well and i just gotta focus on getting as many range levels as i possibly can and unfortunately it's looking like i'm gonna have to set up with wines after oh gosh i'm just gonna hop i'm just gonna hop i am not i am not risking anything right now holy [ __ ] no i'm not gonna fight you bro get out of here man so i decided to come to the barbarians instead their lower combat level hopefully i could just get better xp per hour at them um an hour and six minutes left it is a decent amount of time considering we only have three hours for the challenge but the problem is is money again guys i lost my whole 10k cashjack and everything i had i just had the studded chaps that i was able to sell back so thankfully thankfully we had that but the big problem is is that if i focus too much on making money you know i'm not going to have 30 range and i think having a maple short bow out of the arrows is is crucial to be able to win this challenge but of course then adi arrows costs a lot of money so it's it's a bit of a predicament we're in but i figure 30 range is important whether we use addy arrows or not we could use the maple short bow in the fight as long as we have 30 range bronze spear you're going to buy 410 what are you gonna buy the next one four nine eight okay [ __ ] it sell all those uh sell five of those as well give us a little bit more money probably sell the runes over to aubry uh i could sell that i should have sold that to pexa uh bronze javelin yeah okay cool oh i don't have the thieving level uh okay i'm gonna pickpocket this man to level five thieving shouldn't take too long and then i'm gonna grab a full inventory of teas beautiful and now we get our hp back up and it also gives an attack bonus which i didn't know i did not know tees did that so i won't be bringing them to the fight but it will be helpful throughout us uh trying to get some xp so we can get 30 defense okay i'm going for it i'm gonna sell this and i'm gonna sell this and that should allow me to buy that so if we do get killed we'll at least keep the addy sword and the full helm rather than losing 3k gp so that's why i've gone ahead and done that and we got some teas get a little bit more xp and then i probably need to move on i probably need to go ahead and actually grab myself the stronghold for the money as well i think i'm going to do 30. i don't see it being a problem here um so yeah we should be good to get it right this could be some serious issues here a couple of people who just walked up to me and this is not looking good at all at all so let's go we're gonna get out of here i'm gonna run out of run try and get a box off with he he scold on me i'm gonna have enough food to get in though so i think i'm gonna be okay this is very annoying though it is spoiling my plans is this a safe zone that's the question i hope so yes okay cool beautiful right there we go guys 30 defense so we can put this on now which is very very nice and i am in full rush mode here 36 minutes left and i have so much i want to do i still want to do witch's potion um so just let me through please i still want to do witch's potion so i can get my hp up to like 30ish um and then i also need to buy stews i need to also buy all the adi armor as well so i've been collecting the uh i've been collecting the drops and stuff so that i can sell these off to uh pecks are upstairs it's gonna be close guys it's gonna be really close i don't know if i'm gonna get it all done but uh we will see so let's just focus on getting 30 range right now we can buy some more bronze arrows if you absolutely have to it's not that far away probably should have done that first i wasn't really thinking i was just rushing to get here but um yeah we should be okay for at least 30 range so let's smash that out and then focus on getting money because we might have to head back up to the wilderness and settle with a few addy arrows maybe myth arrows and wines for the final fight but let's just see how long this takes is first of all it looks like we're smashing through these levels so ultimately came back to cavs because they're still surprisingly much much faster xp per hour just because their defense level is so bad um don't really want to go to rock crabs or sand crabs one it takes a while to walk there and two i feel like that's just asking to die if i die at this point it's just an automatic loss for me so definitely don't want to do that so we can now hit four so the xp per hour is definitely going to speed up a little bit i think right at 30 i mean it actually depends how much time we have left over so let's just get 31st and then plan our next move food's going to be kind of an issue and i don't want to do it last second so of course like i said we're going to have to get some wines so we're going to buy as much as we can now in terms of what we can fit in our inventory and we will swing back at the very end of course to top off on the info but you know since people come here and buy wines i'm sure every now and then i figured just to get like 10 or 15 now is uh is worth it oh my gosh here we go 30 range 30 range one more i've been picking up my arrows only what i need so i was getting very lazy with picking them up because i just want to maximize my xp rates but we now have the maple short bow equipped 606 coins i'll probably sell these six ks turns that i got from the barbarians let's just eat that it's a full so uh i want to just head straight to the wildy deep wildy oh my gosh get in the bank get in the bank i have food i have food i have food i need to get to the safe zone this is just the [ __ ] that i don't need in my life you know oh man come on get in the bank can't catch a break here there we go all right so we're gonna hop worlds obviously then we are going to pull the lever in edgeville pick up a plate body pick up the um the stabs and actually get a knife real quick i can get that pretty easily or anything that cuts a web okay cool we have 20 minutes to do so i just remembered the old hold down space bar and skip straight through everything so it has been a lot quicker than i thought it was going to be before come on of course we get a long one here literally work flawlessly like one or two seconds every time and the one i show you it takes forever to skip through but that is the 10k i think yeah beautiful okay let's get out of here i can't i'm not gonna i don't have the time to go and get the boots so we are straight out and i'm gonna sell these helmets to pexa and then we are gonna go ahead and do everything we need to do but there's always time for a black cape quickly just got it off the uh highwayman also grabbed myself a few wines um and got the cheese from draenor so we can actually do the witch's house but this is going to be tight 26 minutes left let's go ahead and buy the ali chain and i think i'm going to do the witch's house with just the alley chain and the helm i'm probably not going to bother buying the legs for now because i think it's just going to be quicker to uh i don't think i'll have enough time to go all the way to algorithm and back because i still got my food over in sears as well this is going to be really really tight okay we're looking pretty good right now so we use the cheese on the mouse hole and then we use the magnet on the mouse and that will open the door beautiful okay we made it we made it right use the key on the door and we have to start killing these guys and hopefully they're not going to mess me up too badly because i don't think he can actually get out of here i have to like safe spot in the corner and like home telly or something so we've really got to hope that last one's easy enough to kill we will see we will see 22 hp coming in very nice first one down very easily we seem to be doing fine i've actually uh haven't eaten yet we are a little low hp but i haven't eaten yet we've nearly put this bear down to nothing so the next one should be pretty easy i think it's gonna probably make me eat a few times but we should be able to get it down i don't think the bear and the wolf are that different in terms of combat stats okay i'm gonna go for a strategic wine there by the time that we eat again hopefully that would have gone back up to full we hit six there lovely probably should not be in falador considering it's like a multi-hot spot but i am super low combat but um let's just sell this and these really quick i mean i don't really need that [ __ ] anymore don't need that so okay 859 coins right up to edgeville guys wait does it sell a knife in here please sell a knife no it doesn't sell a knife oh gosh okay i'll i'll figure something out just snag yourself a knife from the upstairs part of the general store in varrock oh you're freaking me out there man so right to edgeville pull the lever loot the stuff head back sell it buy the gear buy the food um and hopefully we can do it in about 15 minutes i didn't record it but we bought a cape we also got back pretty quick cause i forgot we could take the obelisk so we took the obelisk by 35 willy i think it is 213 got it got it pretty quickly i'm like my third or fourth try not even third try i think and uh yeah so we have four steel plate bodies four staff of earth's now we have four minutes to go but we're pretty close to varrock so here's all i have to do sell this stuff really quick buy my myth arrows buy the studded chaps if i think i can pick up the leather body i will if not screw it telly home run to draenor buy food i think i can do it i think i can do it um i'm not going to overthink this i'm going to fly through it we have three and a half minutes left and i think i think we have just enough time right everything is sold by the chaps i actually have 7.7 k that's more than i thought screw it we're buying addies switch faster switch faster are you kidding me are you kidding me are you kidding me are you kidding me are you joking so unfortunately guys that's the time i didn't have enough time to buy a full inventory of wines um we don't need that and we don't need that um yeah so i'm missing out on seven which really does freaking suck here and it just really sucks because i died so early but i think considering i died as quick as i did and i still to make all that money still get 30 range um managed to get addy arrows too i mean do i think adi arrows are worth not having seven food no but of course everything is like split second decision making and uh crap you know just walking everywhere it's hard to tell how long it takes to get from point a to point b i'm not used to having one agility in my accounts um but we did get 30 range um we do have this but if he's going magic or something i'm probably not even gonna focus on prayer flicking because he can probably hit like eights nines or tens depending on what spell he's doing um and i'd rather just be be making sure i'm eating i think i could hit like sixes i hope at least with addie arrows if not it's gonna be at least five i could hit five with bronze or four with bronze sorry so i would like to think addy is much much better with that um but yeah we got 30 range eight prayer and we're missing seven wines in our inventory bit stressed but like i said i feel like we did pretty good for what we were given with um with that unlucky death i was literally just walking to the falador pen and died by a magic biker crazy and lucky just wrong place wrong time but let's go fight link and i will see you guys at the fight i think i might be able to flinch it if i go in the corner or this corner or something i think you can flinch it if it comes to it but i think we're going to be okay although we only have a couple of times oh yes right louie louie louie give me your legs bro that sounds wrong drop a stew louie where are you mate there he is hiding in the corner boom and there we go pick up the stew and then with this inventory space here i think i'm just gonna buy a kebab um they on average heal 10 so that's not too bad over here is it there is a chance it won't heal me at all so i'm definitely not going to be relying on it in the fight but it's you know it's something i might as well do um while i can so there we go cool right drop the coins take the stew and i'm probably gonna spend the last six minutes training on these guys hopefully get definitely one strength level maybe two if uh if we're quick enough so let's go for it right just gonna get this level and then i'm gonna get myself into a safe zone because it is not worth it i'm not gonna get another level and i do not wanna die right now so just there we go into the safe zone 31 strength and that's going to be me done guys so let's go see how kinz is done because when we made new accounts yesterday i was like just literally talking about it but i didn't want to say anything because i didn't want you to change it but of course now he [ __ ] changes it this is actually you in about 20 years time like you know your main character i thought he's already 69 dude well exactly this is your 89 mate you know torn legs the hair's really starting to recede and i thought i just i thought i'd recreate you you're looking very posh over there mate yeah dude wait we're back on raag for a second dude he you know what you gotta respect the effort he's got a straggly mustache refuses to shave it and his hair is an abomination but my guy will not give up until the last strain he's gonna have hair dude until the very last strand neither of us are hovered over each other we don't know whether we're hardcores anymore so do you want to just like put a message in the chat each and obviously that was we'll be able to see if we're a hardcore or not anymore uh yeah yeah okay okay all right all right i'm just gonna put a question mark do you want it together okay all right all right and drumroll [Music] he's dead he definitely died oh i actually have public on off one sec oh he's still alive oh my god how did he die ah [ __ ] pku dude like really early i'm talking 15 minutes in really yeah i mean that's the best time to die surely because you don't lose not when you just finish the stronghold then you can't bank your 10k i'm gonna say so i was scrambling the entire episode i spent so much time making money wow oh that's so harsh man yeah dude and i i actually got attacked by two pk's really luckily i had a lot of food on me and managed to get to a bank and they were like screaming at me in the chat like die die i was like whoa come on dude good [ __ ] the name mate do you like my name oh my god i didn't even realize it dude when i came up with that i thought i was a [ __ ] genius i mean it's my take on kids 24. yes i'm [ __ ] aware man's going to lay my dear link i think it's a great idea did you think i was going to have a [ __ ] [ __ ] name or something i dude i could not think of a name yeah this was last week when i was trying to send it asap it didn't even work wow everything i wanted to go with was taken so i'm feeling good i'm not feeling too good i haven't looked at your combat level yet so no i haven't looked to yours either um i mean now you know i was scrounging for a gp the whole time this can't be pretty um um now i guess before we actually show the levels though there were so many roots man that yeah yeah there were obvious metas but there were also ways to counteract i guess other setups three hours on a normal server if we weren't on pvp worlds that's a there's a very easy way to go make as much money and buy as many runes as possible but the fact that if we chucked all our money into runes and then died that's your plan done yeah so i'm gonna tell you now i didn't go magic i did not go magic either wow there you go so i i think let's be honest if we're hardcore on normal uh worlds we would have both got magic uh probably not really if it was if it was two hours i definitely would have gotten magic oh okay i probably i was i was gonna go magic and then i thought nah can't i i was dead i'm not doing the streamline approach yeah okay fair well i'm glad we both didn't go magic that's that's that's now i know he's either melee or rain i i feel like the moment i see that combat level i'll know yeah yeah that's going to give it away for both of us because melee is is waterfall correct range it's just you're probably hacking away or shooting arrows at something the whole time so kids wait you're the challenger so whenever oh you've [Laughter] yeah uh i'm i mean i i know you got some footwear man so put on those boots which ones did he go with wait did you did did you not do uh oh he's got the uh the stronghold i mean you already said you did the stronghold yeah i guess that's not a surprise is it okay interesting did you so you lost the gp like oh like five minutes i just i just eat a piece of food um yeah so five minutes oh i gotta pick that up um five minutes after i finished the stronghold wow i died that is okay and you could hear in my voice for the next 20 minutes i'm like all right guys i got to do this now i i deflect i was demotivated so early on wow and i had no i cuz it was all my money obviously no matter what approach melee ring magic yeah they all need money to progress as fast as you can so wow it was a bit rough it was a bit rough but here we are oh wow the punches man we stuck with the punches and uh we made it to the reveal dead though poor guy oh kids i'm gonna go shield mate i don't have a shield oh i mean this isn't great but i okay well i think you're going melee then unless there's a way to get a crossbow they'll cross really the bronze bulbs from then i'm gonna say you did not do that no i'm beast probably going melee but that's a good time that it's just a shitty shield but yeah shield's also the one you can't really buy a good shield though yeah and also this did give one magic defense so just in case you did go i was like yeah bite as well i'll keep it could be all right right right right look at my guy wouldn't you raj really downgraded his life is what i'm getting at hey your life i think it's around i was speaking to him i think it's around this year your life just starts to tumble mate it gets worse and worse and you end up like this in 20 years so so at 88 i gotta be really careful what happens next a strike right right um i'm gonna go with cape of course i'm gonna i'm gonna one-up you it's probably oh cabbage oh no oh no but visually i got a big red dot yeah oh my god i just [ __ ] clicked on you all right so should i look at your comment level though i didn't see it but i saw the color right the fact that you laughed like i just like just like okay i [ __ ] it oh my god yeah you're definitely melee is he wrench he's definitely melee wow dude i thought for sure you were going magic man i thought you were as well i thought for sure you were going magic i thought you were as well and so i i did everything i could to get as high up as i could so that you couldn't like bang me out in two hits right right i mean i i hope a lot of those levels are just hp levels from the witch's house or something correct so i did do the witches did you do it okay i didn't dude i died i needed all the xp i could get oh yeah okay [ __ ] range oh he has gone range wow okay yeah no i i do 21 combat yeah i think you get higher and you just complete the waterfall quest you know like wow okay dude i'm super satisfied right now kids i'm gonna go with body i don't have a body wow man that really [ __ ] you at the start bad bro that's really bad uh i gotta hit this oh my god he's 30 defense so so it's not you quested the entire time i did waterfall then went to the stronghold and killed minotaurs to 30 defense pretty much i also went over to arnold and got cakes and stuff like that then i just did 30 defense of minotaurs got the money from stronghold but anytime i got money i just bought items so if anyone killed me i would keep the item rather than that so i was like there was a few times where i was like oh [ __ ] i'm not gonna be able to afford this now so i had to like i had to be constantly picking up coins and [ __ ] it wasn't a fun three hours i'll tell you that um and then i had to like pick up bronze full helms and sell them to shops and [ __ ] it was yeah oh my gosh yeah yeah i i just went deep wildy and looted in the four pvp worlds yeah um which was stressful dude because when you don't have any agility levels your run comes back oh yeah so so okay i'm feeling good he's definitely got like an adi full helm probably addie plate legs or if he's really rarrick addie yeah okay all right not that that's a fake rawr you would have gone um i got a hat right yeah um i got i got started wow and i did end up getting 30 rolls that's not bad though ah yeah but um i'll just tell you now i'm one defense so i mean yeah okay that's that's a game changer like even if i would have had better dps that defense and armor kind of just completely negated it you know what about food mate that's the question you know well i i actually uh you know consumed one by mistakes obviously go and get that yeah well i mean it's it's still oh yeah i can't i'm a dumbass and i didn't have enough time to finish getting all the food but i have 21 wines because i don't have any money to buy anything yeah i thought i thought you'd go wines like i thought you'd go mage and you'd get wines i mean it's got to be an addy short sword you know is it hey yeah gotta be yeah so my original plan was assume ego magic yeah just train range the entire episode get maybe get like 13 magic for like a ko potential because it could hit an 8 and i think my range has a six at highest um i want to get like 15 defense or whatever and kind of be like a little tanky range yeah um hoping you go magic and then because range is very cheap to train i wanted to buy a whole bunch of cram wands so that was my plan yeah that would have been quite small um and i was like when he goes melee he would have wasted all of his money on uh on armor and stuff and maybe he'll have wines and it lowers his attack or kebabs yeah but yeah i died 15 minutes in so my whole life i feel for you mate because that is that does as you say just [ __ ] your whole plan up my food kids is 27 stews with one kebab they heal 11 right yeah they hit 11. okay so it's actually the same food the same technically yeah but i'm just gonna give a full inventory i only have 21. 27 and then i've got one kebab because i had to like have the money in my inventory when i bought the uh addy legs no with no mini game teleports and only a home telly it was [ __ ] horrible getting around no agility man oh my god disgusting so much wasted time but uh kids i can't wait to go lose let's do this [Music] and as always guys there is another episode over on raag's channel where we had 10 brackets of different monsters from high level to slightly lower level and we had to kill them in brackets only a certain amount of kills 15 kills in each bracket and then we fought with the gear that was dropped it was a it was an interesting one i'll tell you that uh it's definitely a fight you're going to want to go and watch we have just had it and it is an interesting fight i'll tell you that right now ken's mate oh man here here's where i would usually say like oh yeah i feel like i might have a chance because of x y and z but uh like my oh oh wow i think i've got my light off oh i need to move ether in the wilderness bro that's that's embarrassing we can't even have our fight where we normally do wow i [ __ ] this let's see what i could oh there we go oh star with the suit for [ __ ] sake okay okay i've gotta just consistently hit surely i mean are you 30 strength yeah 30 strength 30 attack 30 defense great 31 strength actually whoa beautiful strong start what's your hp oh actually dude i'm i'm getting way more than i thought i was going to what's your favorite um he's 21. 21. yeah yeah i've got 29 so i've got a bit of an advantage there as well these sixes are lovely see i'm one defense so you just tear through like man 15 defense mate you could have been okay if you'd got it oh my god i overeat i'm not used to being on such low accounts it's horrible enough [ __ ] i gotta remember that dude the amount of times i did it with like cooked meat where i overrip i it was yesterday when we make those accounts eating [ __ ] mugfish at three hp yeah yeah yeah yeah i i agree i think you're hitting better you've got addy arrows as well [ __ ] yeah that's it the last thing i did was make a whole bunch of money for addies and i was just gonna settle for oh i just bought them yeah where abouts oh barrack oh is that addy and blarock oh oh my god yeah six [Laughter] okay i mean normally i'd be very stressed but uh okay yeah she's good that's the video [Music] interesting interesting against on the page try and make that as as as normal looking as possible please mate try draw it out somehow ken's mate i i feel for you because you got shafted at the start of this challenge and it's just wrecked you for the whole thing yeah yeah i mean but it was a huge gamble on if you went magic so yeah yeah that was a problem as well but i was surprised that i actually was still kind of hitting you with 30 range on 30 defense yeah yeah i i think if you've gone for if you've been able to get the 15 defense i think you could have been looking pretty good yeah because if i would have got like a black chain body with that or something a little bit more hp levels as well if you've gone for 50 i think yeah you would have been looking great but it's the way it goes sometimes i mean that was the point of this challenge we were hoping one of us would die for a little bit of content and kins you've taken the fall there mate i thought i was gonna die when those two guys came for me but we got away we got away it was it was awesome dude the thing is with me i 10 hp i got one banged with like water blast yeah you know it was rough painful so bees and geez click the link in the description to go and watch raag's video as an absolute banger and uh we don't say bye do we kids no we do not no but we will see them over there exactly we'll see you over there you guys click that link just waiting for you to say yeah as you say like 50 of the time i actually what the viewers don't know is as soon as i stop saying record clicking record then i just say yeah
