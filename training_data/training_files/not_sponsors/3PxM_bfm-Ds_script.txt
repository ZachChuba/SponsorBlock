been doing it every single week for the last year i think this is close to the one year anniversary maybe honestly past the one year anniversary at this point um but man it is good to see you guys it is good to hang out with you all um i'm very excited it's gonna be an exciting stream no audio no sound hmm weird okay because i'm getting audio one moment can y'all hear me now test test let's see can you guys hear me give me the thumbs up audio delay how much of a delay super lag super delay hmm audio's just delayed can you hear me now is this better now dang there's audio now delay sound late coming okay um i have no idea why this would be happening three all right i think we're gonna we're gonna figure this out um bear with me bear with me okay we sh should be good now y'all i think i just had to i was messing with some stuff testing testing yo let me know if it's good should be good i had i was messing with the audio okay it's fixed now it works yeah okay guys apologies on that um yeah i was messing with some audio doing some vst plugins and whatnot we're fixed we're back to it thank you thank you guys for joining me um you all scared me thank you thank you all right so back to it y'all um we have a lot of very fun announcements to get into on this stream i'm gonna be announcing the guest judges who are going to join me next week to go through the top 100 renders we can't go through there's 700 submissions right now at this point um and if you guys don't know what i'm talking about i'm running a cg challenge i'm giving you guys basically a an animation template and i'm working on that art right here today on the stream now i'm gonna announce the guest judges in probably about five minutes here i'm right i'm not going to wait till the end of the stream to do that to you guys that would be horrible but i do want to just say first how excited i am that you guys have participated in this challenge it's been insane like i said there's 700 plus submissions so far um at five seconds each that is just under an hour for this montage so next week we're going to be doing the art review and choosing the winners the week after that will be the montage there's going to be two montage videos there's going to be a top 100 montage video and then there's going to be everything and i'm going to be dropping those on the same day for you guys to just dig through it all and have a good time with it um like i said 700 plus submissions with like four days left that's like that that's an hour that is an hour right now so it's going to be a good time going through all that and making sure everyone's names and discords and um instagrams and twitters are all correct on that it's gonna be intense um other than that let's see i got a booklet here i got a booklet with with announcements let's see okay so let me talk to you guys about what we're doing on this stream all right because this is my last stream before we you know before we dive into um the review the breakdown uh showing the winners my art breakdown all that good stuff this is the last working stream so i want to show you guys where my art is at right now and what i like about it what i don't like about it i'm gonna go ahead and open up after effects and show you guys what i've created over the last month um so let's see here i am i have officially like maxed out c4d this is kind of where it's at right now this is the art this is what it's looking like but let me open up after effects and bring in some of these renders to show you all what we are looking at and where my art has come over the last month okay so let me switch over to a standard view uh workspace reset all right so this is what we're looking at guys um this was the first thing that i kind of came up with on the first week that we did this and i was going for something if i pull up my pure ref file um where i was basically going for a big post-apocalyptic destroyed kind of scene right so something like this is what i was going for and you guys have seen in the thumbnail um this was kind of my like my concept art that guided me so far and we got this and it's doing a little like a side scroller action here and it's getting us to like a little uh basically this little ravine this wash that goes to a giant hole in the background which is kind of difficult to tell that there's a hole in the background now from there you know i kept working on it and i got you can see here that the detail in the foreground has been shifted a little bit i added a fence i added a little bit of fog and i actually took some photos and made some custom textures out of these photos in a sewer and put them down into this little uh this kind of hurricane wash river ravine thing um storm drain situation and i think on the last stream i talked about how i did that so from there right we're going to v3 and there's a big difference between v2 and v3 v3 i've messed with the lighting and i've clearly added some destroyed buildings these are some photo scans i got on turbo squid that are just insane um and i changed out the hdri worked on the lighting just a little bit and i actually switched out this hole if i scroll forward i switched out the hole for a sewer because the hole wasn't selling it didn't look like a hole so i was like let's just make it a cave instead basically i added a little bit of plants down in there um and you know essentially just kept adding a bit more detail v3 to v4 is you know an even bigger difference because i'm adding more buildings in the background um i change the lighting you guys can see that the lighting is starting to shift i'm starting to pay attention to that um but you know i like how there's light bouncing off the edges of these guys but not really here it's like a not really happy with that situation but the render's getting better it's improving over time but i'm still not happy with it at this point i'm still not happy with it and it wasn't until v5 that i started to be like yes this feels like something and v5 i've really spent time on the lighting and i obviously switched out the background here i completed my background or at least most of the background and i really focused on the lighting i wanted to make sure so if i scroll to the end both of these you can see oh this one actually didn't make it to the end let's let's consider this the v5 and get rid of the color correction i have on here that doesn't look good at all boom all right so let's just consider this the v5 and at the end i'm really starting to pay attention to the lighting like i said so i have a sunspot coming down hitting this robot right here um and we're going to get into that we're going to get into the story elements because that's what i'm going to be working on on today's stream are the story elements and i'm i'm going to touch on that in just a second here but yeah look at the difference between this this is a huge difference i really paid attention like i said to the lighting i wanted the sun to come down here and illuminate the foreground but just the strip of the foreground i wanted the the very foreground to be in in shadow and behind that also in shadow and i'm essentially doing like strips of light that go into the background right um so i'm going to talk to you guys about how i did that how exactly i'm doing that but what we're going to get into on the stream today is how to take your render from what we're looking at right here which looks amazing like i'm very happy with the composition and the lighting right now i'm still gonna tweak it a little bit but i'm like really excited about the way this looks but it's not enough because we have seen time and time again the post-apocalyptic look you've seen it in book of eli you've seen it in children of men you've seen it in edge of tomorrow you've seen it in you know a million other movies that look like this and for me to be able to get this look looking as good maybe as those movies maybe it looks that good i would hope so um that's not good enough for me i need to be able to stand out from all the other post-apocalyptic scenes that feel cliche and what we're gonna do the way we're gonna do that is with story and style so the last 20 you guys have heard the 80 20 rule story and style so um 80 20 right is the idea that uh 80 of your thing is recognizable it's known people have seen it before people people tend to gravitate towards things they know so that's the 80 but if you know it too much you're gonna get bored you know you can watch your favorite show so many times unless you know maybe it's the office or something but still like you want that 20 freshness the 20 freshness is what i'm looking for in this render right now it's just 100 percent fine but it needs the 20 fresh and that's what i'm gonna do with story and style i'm gonna see if i can't figure that out on this stream so um i'm gonna let you guys know the guest judges here in just a moment it's 70 off two years of nordvpn it's a good freaking time um so yeah everybody let's freaking do it let's uh announce these judges so who could it be who could it be all right y'all so we're talking three judges we got three judges to announce all right the first judge is going to be none other than mr peter france the blender master himself peter france will be joining us next week live on the stream to go over the top 100 renders and what we're gonna do so actually we're gonna get together beforehand and determine the winners before so we know exactly where we're going and then we're gonna we're gonna show you guys what we got so we're gonna look at every single one and make sure we truly choose the top uh the top 100 so that we can choose the top five from that because there's just no way we can do all 700 plus all right so peter is the first one who's the second one the second one is none other than mr ren weichmann who will be joining us peter and wren will be joining us live next week on the stream to freaking review your guys's art and finally oh i'm excited to tell you guys about this i'm very excited um guys ian hubert is going to join us he's coming on the stream um if you guys don't know who ian hubert is man he just put out his latest short film dynamo episode one it's like 20 minutes long and it's insane ian hubert is going to be coming down and he's going to be joining us next week wren peter ian and myself the four of us are going to be looking at your art we're going to be breaking it down live next week and choosing the top five winners and giving you all some amazing prizes um first place gets a full rococo mocap suit with like the gloves and everything you also get a wacom tablet you get uh aftershocks aeropex headphones you get you know a year of quixo mega scans and you get some awesome pny ssds and it just goes down from there so guys it's going to be intense it's going to be a very fun stream the four of us are all good friends so we have a really good energy together and it's going to be a good time so i really look forward to that all right y'all um let's hop into it so um super amp for that yeah it's gonna be good it's gonna be a really good one next week but yeah this week you know we are focusing on focusing on how to take this render to the next level you know what i mean it looks good but it just kind of blends in with all the other post-apocalyptic scenes you may have seen and we're going to try and fix that on the stream today so we're going to do that with story and style and i'm hoping that the story elements i add to this render can be that extra 20 freshness that we need to really make this render catch your eye and i'm hoping that this 20 the 20 of story that we're using to stand out a little bit from all the other renders i'm hoping that that could also be um style points too because right now it yeah i guess it's kind of stylized it's a post-apocalyptic scene but you know i do have a robot here chillin right in this robot um you know this robot is uh it's fine you know it's it's i'm choosing to go that like sci-fi route but again we've seen that before we've seen like the sci-fi post-apocalyptic thing with like edge of tomorrow and a bunch of other movies and shows and ips and whatnot so i'm looking i'm looking for ways to to amplify that so here's what i have right now here's the idea that's in my head you guys know that this is a render challenge with a character right so we have a character um the current setup is there like holding something they're carrying something um and i'm thinking about that element so what could they be carrying and who is the character so here's my thoughts what if you essentially had a robot character it could be a robot or it could be a human and they're pulling you know those like it's called a palinking it's like a a royal box with two sticks on it that two different people carry to carry around the king or the queen or some royalty person and they're in this box so they don't have to walk around that's a palanquin so imagine this character carrying a hovering palinkine a hovering little royal box that's made of beautiful ornate gold so already we have a juxtaposition between the destroyed poor dirty dark environment and this ornate filthy rich golden box and in this box is a person that you can't quite see but you you can see their arm is hanging out like you rolled down your window and your got your arm hanging out why does the mic have a 3d sound god dang um i don't know let's see desktop mic um hmm i spent the last couple like here's what i'm gonna do i'll probably just hmm god dang y'all trying to get me to fix this mic situation hmm i'm gonna get it fixed next time we do this let me change this up real quick is that any better i'd have no like filters nothing on this right now so this is just raw the raw mic um it sounds perfect sounds good sounds great all right let's go back to it this is this is the difference now someone's trolling all right we're chilling we're good y'all are chilling okay so anyway back to the idea so like a rolled down window you have the arm hanging out of this royal box that is hovering it's made of gold and it's a robot arm with like gold rings on it and everything and it looks like super ornate really nice and that image to me is really interesting because what happened here was there a robo war and did the robots win and now the robots are doing the same thing that the humans did to the robots like we made robots we made them do what we want whatever we want when we want and now the tide has turned so it's like you know the terminator situation where we go to war with the robots but the robots win and they force us to like carry them around and like work for them we're basically slaves to these robots they enslave the human race so that's kind of what i'm going with right now that's my 20 story style pass and i would kind of build out the environment and add little details to the environment to essentially um you know to make that happen and tell to tell that story so i would put a bunch of like empty um shells from like a bunch of different rifles here in the mud in the foreground so there'd be little gold shells everywhere i'd probably put a machine gun nest right up here with some sandbags and a machine gun that was shooting down at this robot right here um yeah and maybe a couple other things i also want to accentuate this spherical shape here because right that's part of it is you have the character and you have the sphere so i want to be able to to really build that sphere out and i'd probably do it with some like uh with some like uh what is it called um power lines that go off into the background and whatnot so that's what i do and then on the robot here i think i'm gonna put a bunch of birds on it have some uh grass and trees grow on it i'm probably gonna re-texture it and like build it out really nice probably not gonna do that on the stream but it's just a lot of nitpicky stuff but we'll see where we get to um and i think we have a bunch of cables coming from the robot leading into the sewer so it's like the humans are hiding in the sewer and there's like cables and they're taking parts and taking it into the sewer or something that's probably what i'll do so that's the game plan that is the game plan to wrap out my render um hopefully by june 1st june 1st is the deadline for everyone to get their renders done um since i can't win my own contest i you know maybe i'll take till june 2nd or 3rd but i don't know there's a part of me that just wants to finish it on june 1st like everybody else so that's my goal that is my aim we have a couple uh super chats to shout out here we have um the psych noru apologies if i butchered the name there but i appreciate you with that super chat brother thank you so much number one fan heck yeah i appreciate you we have sai sharon as always um welcome back mr sai sharon says hey clint how are you doing fine excited for the stream good to hang out with you again this week the feeling is mutual buddy and way back at the top way at the top i think there was another one i'm pretty sure there was another super chat that i missed from a very generous person that i um apologized i was in it you know we were in announcement mode but i appreciate you sir thank you so much um so i got to ask my moderators are we sounding good visual i see you're in here um i don't know if we have any other mods but let me know if the mic is sounding good if everything is sounding good um i want to know that we're looking good to move forward jones lab thank you derek parra thank you for the super chat your guys support is very very helpful um so jones says yo have some boocha money thank you thank you can't wait for judging people need to know did ian ever text you back oh yes yes okay so last week on the stream um ian hubert came onto the stream and was like typing up and saying hey blah blah you know good to see you and i was like hey are you the real ian he's like of course and i was like okay well then um prove it what food do we get when you come down to la and he said noodles and i was like we do get noodles but like it's ramen but noodles kind of works okay and then ian i was like i was like kind of suspicious and then he ended it with like blender is the best or something and i'm like i don't think that's ian i don't think ian would say blender's the best even though he uses it he's just not he's not in that war blender's better and before he sucks and like that's not ian so i'm like dude i texted him and he was very busy he was finishing dynamo so it took him a while to get back to it but no that wasn't in that was not ian hubert so whoever's freaking posing as ian hubert you suck and uh don't do that don't do that derek parra thank you for the super chat i appreciate you man heck yeah good times but yeah guys the judges if you're just popping in here it's going to be peter france ren wykman and ian hubert um with myself next week live streaming reviewing your art choosing the top five winners for the alternate realities cg contest guys so it's gonna be a hoot and a half let's dive into this all right let's dive into this it's been long enough cfo d i really love like this reminds me of like the last of us concept art it's the lighting it's all about that like foreground there's a little streak of sunlight there's a streak of light coming in let me show you guys how i'm getting this look right now because it's a really like i'm really digging this look so i'm gonna uncheck check camera so i can hop out of my camera but keep the render live and let's go out here i have 24 gigabytes of vram and but there's 2.4 gigabytes left i have maxed out my scene we are on the edge here for this scene um so i'm probably gonna clean that up in a bit but check this out y'all to get this look i got these things called flags and i'm going to show you how i'm using these flags and what they are um and they're essentially blocking the light if i take these flags away look at my render and when i take the flags away look what look at what happens it's just super bright and the sunlight is hitting every single part of the render there's no shape to it there's no there's no depth to it and it's the flags by blocking light in specific places you're able to get this really moody look right so that's when you see on set the like the giant black tarps that's that's called duvetyne you're blocking light like all that good stuff you're shaping like you're adding light you're taking it away very specifically so let me show you my lighting setup i'll show you my lighting setup um so in my lights i got a sunlight that's hitting my scene and i have one light it's very it's a very simple lighting setup so check this out this is a hdri of just gray it is just gray that is all that is lighting my scene right now that you're seeing right here matthias um brother thank you for the super chat you're psyched for the stream uh the destroyed buildings look great i was wondering how you did those or if you know a good tutorial to finish off um wish you a good stream thank you brother yeah yeah no these these uh these are photo scans of destroyed buildings and i'm gonna be honest with you all this is the most money i've ever spent on a 3d asset uh they they were a pretty penny but they're worth it because i want the highest quality possible and these these were that these were the highest quality destroyed buildings i could find the ones from kit bash 3d they just weren't high res enough for a foreground element but these ones man these definitely took the cake and there's like 26 different buildings like this and they're just they're very smart when i was going through and i was like retexturing everything and i was linking all the textures and you know making c4d files from the fbx's i learned how these were created and i was like that is genius they did photo scans and they like kit bashed their own like destroyed building pack from like one or two um large-scale photo scans they took the roof was a separate scan from the actual building and then they have all these other scans of like dirt and rubble in here that you know can like move out and come around like this so it's done in a very unique way um okay so going back to lighting right we um are lighting this right now just with an hdri environment that's just literally a gray color this gray sky is lighting this now what i'm doing is i'm adding a little light up top here that i can show you all this is just a big old area light way back here it's blasting the scene to get me this reflective specular highlight off the ground and that is doing so much to add a bit more detail just brings a lot of detail out from the ground from these textures and i always love a little bit of that high specularity contrast in the renders like that so i think that's really nice next what i'm doing obviously you know we got some fog here to kind of even things out a little bit and like this alone looks cool but it needs more shape it really needs more shape to it so let me take the fog away for a second i'm adding in a sunlight so the sunlight is um essentially mixed with the hdri environment so if i uncheck this box on the sunlight tag it's going to look just like daylight it's going to be a blue sky but no we want the sky to be that gray that's coming from our hdr environment so that's why i checked this mixed sky texture and it's going to take the sunlight from the sunlight right here the octane daylight and it's going to take the sky from the hdri environment but this is too bright it's not moody enough it's not the vibe i'm going for so obviously you all know me we need to add some fog up in here and that's going to diffuse the light a lot all right and if you guys are curious you know for my fog settings it's basically 0.0025 and just some you know absorption and scattering colors here and my scattering phase is cranked up just a little bit um john malcolm you got a good question so y'all are asking about the um the render challenge the judging process the montage video that comes after that um here's exactly what is happening next week myself peter wren and ian hubert are going to get together and we're going to live stream the top 100 renders um we cannot do all there's 700 plus submissions right now all right um we can't do all of them live but what we're gonna do is we're gonna meet beforehand and we're gonna go through all of the submissions we're gonna go through every single submission and we're gonna make sure we choose the top five privately before the stream so now when we go on to the stream on next saturday we already know where we're going and we're going to review the top 100 and work with you guys all the way back up to the top five winners so from there um if you're if you're talking like from your guys's perspective you're only going to see the top 100 renders on that saturday next week but when the montage comes out the following week there's going to be two montages there's going to be a top 100 montage and then there's going to be everybody's everybody's art there's no way i would have you all work this hard not to show off everyone's art okay so trust me there's going to be the top 100 montage and then there's going to be everybody's montage which right now with 700 plus submissions is 59 minutes long that's why i'm doing a top 100 and everyone right because i'm i'm uh equating that that full montage the the full cut will be probably an hour and a half maybe maybe longer but probably an hour and a half long so yeah i'll give you guys both i'll give you guys a curated top 100 and then just bam everything because i think it's going to be so cool to just kick back and watch watch it go you know put it on the tv let it go for an hour and a half at a party if you guys have any house parties coming up soon you know kova is getting a little a little bit more controlled at least here in the states i know it's it's tough in india to to all my indian viewers right now how are you guys doing you guys hanging in there with the covid situation i know it's kind of tough for you guys i hear it's bad and it's difficult to get the vaccine so my heart goes out to all you guys i hope you're staying safe in india over there um i hope to come visit one day seriously i love the culture i love the food i love the art i love everything about it so i'm a big yogi myself as well so yeah i hope you guys are doing okay i hope you guys are hanging in there maybe we'll come visit soon um so yeah guys that's the plan that's the plan john malcolm thanks for asking man good question on your end there um i wouldn't want to miss out you know putting all your guys's renders together so okay back to it y'all back to it this is the look right now we got the sunlight blasting in here we got some fog and we got the hdri gray um the gray guy but it's just looking too happy you know i don't like these these vibes they're too happy so that's where i'm coming in with the flags and these flags i turn these on are gonna shape the scene now what i'm doing here i'll go through one flag at a time with you guys and i'll show you what each one is doing so let's see let's um let's turn that off let's go up in here and just turn these on one by one okay so this first one is getting me if i scrub to the end of my scene this one is giving me a spotlight of sun right on this little area with the robot and the wall right here it's a little spotlight of sun so if i turn this on and off you can see how this whole wall is lit up but with this um but with this flag right here you guys can see there's a little it's blocking the light it's blocking a bunch of light except for this little hole which is coming down here and basically looking right at this robot that's what it's doing so that's the first flag the second flag is more for the foreground let me wheel on back to the foreground for you guys and show you what these flags are doing take it back there okay the second flag is going to be a foreground flag and that's going to essentially take the light away from let's see foreground you see there's a big old dark shadow right in the front which draws our eye more towards the the focal point there's gonna be a character here right in the middle so there's basically a strip of sunlight hitting the character and the mid ground right up in here so that's what this flag is doing and his octane octane is crashing on me i wouldn't be surprised because we have pushed it to the max here we go we mean business the game factory what's up dude good morning i got uh i believe i got your submission i think i saw it in the giant old spreadsheet thank you so much for joining you guys are awesome and we're we're nearly at 800 viewers right now that is freaking sick thank you guys for sticking with me and hanging out i hope it's a chill time for y'all okay so um back to the flags right we're talking about flags how i'm blocking the light how i am creating and shaping the vibe of this scene so that's the foreground flag that's taking your eyeballs away from this really bright light source right in the front here it's like no this stuff isn't important it's the character that's important so that's what that flag is for the next flag let's see here let me take away the fog for just a second so it renders a bit faster the second or third flag what is the third flag doing what is the third flag doing i think the third flag is kind of it looks like it's oh it's not doing much to be honest that one is kind of just giving me a little bit more shadow on the side of the building to imagine to pretend essentially that the building continued on that it didn't just cut off right here because i need to save as much computer juice as possible i'm cutting that i'm cutting that freaking building right off right there as soon as i can't see it on the you know on the other side of the camera so this flag is essentially just being like it's a little bit darker on this side you know and it gives a little bit of like contact area ambient occlusion kind of right up in here and just kind of it's like a natural vignette to the image is essentially what it's doing so that's that one and then finally we have one more and i think it's hitting this little foreground area here if i turn that one on exactly yeah so it's just shaping this a little bit more right up here in the foreground without it you can see that there's like specular highlights it's just like the sun is blasting off of this concrete right here same for this barrel if i get that flag in there just right i sneak it in there it's just a little strip just a little umbrella of uh of shadow it's just gonna the light the sunlight is just gonna touch it right here just gracefully bam so that's what the flags are doing very important to shape the scene so this is without the flags it's just like all up in your face and then with the flags it's it shapes it and gets a lot nicer and then you add the fog in there and man you're looking at you're looking at this right here you know and it's looking amazing so that's the breakdown y'all that's the breakdown so far let's get into those story elements let's put up a little machine gun bunker up here let's get some shells maybe in the mud and then let's um let's work on that palinking you guys are with me earlier i talked about a royal royal box that two people usually um traditionally carry way back in the old times you've seen them like they carry the two sides and then they you know are like running and they got the king in this box so they don't have to walk that's called a palinkin so i'm gonna make a royal golden high-tech hovering sci-fi palinking with a robot inside of it with its arm hanging out and like a bunch of gold rings and like chains on it and stuff that has enslaved the human race to do um it's it's bidding for the robots because the robots won this war obviously all right and by the way oh so yeah um frederico you said so how to do the flags the flags are just planes they're just planes with uh a black non-reflective texture on the plane so i just yeah i basically have you know this texture here it's just a diffused texture that's set to zero zero zero black it doesn't reflect anything it's not a glossy surface otherwise there'd be bounce light no we won't want any bounce light we just want diffuse for those flags there my mate joe what's up dude thank you for the super chat um he says thanks for the streams dude i got you man thanks for hopping in with me and i may have missed one um um apologies for for butchering the name there but man i appreciate you thank you for the super chat i hope you're doing well um shout outs to all my fans in india i hope you guys are hanging in there stay safe all right stay safe out there i'll make it down to your teals country eventually it is high on my list all right shout outs to all the 800 people we got up in here very nice very very fun okay all right all right so where do we begin i have 1.6 gigabytes of vram left i have used 18.5 gigabytes of vram so i think the first thing i need to do to be honest with y'all is clean up my scene okay so i think what i'm going to do i think what we're gonna do here is probably get rid of a couple things and clean it up just a bit so i have some like train tracks going on here that aren't really doing anything so i think i'm gonna delete those um let's see here yeah these train tracks here i'm not really using those so those can go um let's see i'm using all of this stuff here i know i'm not using this second barrel i went with the blue barrel instead so i can delete this barrel and hopefully we'll free up some vram we're at 1.6 right now so let's delete that barrel um what else can we delete we can probably get rid of ah what can we get rid of in this build we can probably get rid of the back side of that building perhaps you might be able to get rid of [Music] that's a tough one these are all instances too right so they're not just a duplicate of the model they're actually just uh it's referencing the main model dang that might be it man like i might have to just do some serious work like not on the stream to to clean that up a little bit because that's that's no fun to watch what i will do is remove any unused texture so go material remove unused materials and that's going to get rid of any materials that i'm not using in the actual rendered scene i have swapped out the 2k textures for the 4k textures yes so um for instance you know i have essentially switched out this barrel this is an 8k barrel these are 8k little rubble pieces here this is all 8k stuff here um you know everything else is um let's see everything else is like either 4k or 2k i think there's some 8k textures right here in the foreground this little wood structure is an 8k texture but everything else is as cheap as we can get it right so let's see if we can't get like a machine gun nest up in this little this little area there's a bunch of sunlight hitting this area which is something i was trying to do um was to get some sunlight clipping just on this little little um outcropping so i'm going to open up qixel bridge and try and get that going john malcolm said it 8k is madness for background elements there is no need whatsoever for 8k background elements i'm only using 8k for the foreground elements and 4k you know at times for the mid ground maybe even the foreground and then uh definitely 2k for everything else the tiny stuff the background stuff keep that stuff low y'all definitely um and julian yeah the sphere shape i need to work on the sphere the spherical shape as well um okay so i know they have sandbags this is what i need right here sandbag barrier um i've already downloaded it i don't know why you download it again and let's go with the 2k export that and we got some sandbags in here they kind of look like poop right now so what i'm gonna do to fix that is essentially go to the material setting itself and guys uh octane has been crashing on me a whole bunch my computer as it is wits and it is at the freaking tippy top of its capacity so material type i'm going to switch that to glossy and the brdf model will go to octane and then since the color correction i have going on here is a little intense i'm just going to bring down the well here before i mess with the compositing of my sandbags let me get the sandbag up in place okay so i want this guy up in the corner here little machine gun nest up here to fight off the robots and then we can hopefully render region up in here yep yeah splitting the scene in the foreground and background is probably what i'll end up doing let's see if we can't get these sandbags to look like sandbags up here because right now they don't look like sandbags they're a little dark i'm gonna scale them whoa um does that even work what's the z okay i'm gonna scale them up it's like the end of uh saving private ryan have you guys seen save in private ryan one of the greatest war movies of all time i think the greatest war movie of all time yeah saving private ryan what an amazing movie so these sandbags are chilling on the edge here i might tilt them down a little bit because this is this is after the war right this is certainly like it's been a minute so those look like some sandbags up there push them back a little bit more and you want you want to really like sell the fact that these are sandbags so putting them up there um is not good enough you need to put them up there and make it feel like they look like sandbags and it's starting to get there and i think what i'll do is i'll probably put like uh the tip of a machine gun a giant machine gun sticking out from this thing and that's how you're going to really sell that these things are our sandbags here like you're going to you're going to get the idea you see machine gun you see sandbags maybe you'll see a little bit of smoke or something i don't know i guess that would kind of mean that they the machine gun was just shot but that's not what i'm going for also you see how this little black window back here is messing with the the silhouette of my sandbags so what you could do is actually take this building back here and move it down just a little bit so that you don't see that black little window messing with the shape of the sandbag you see what i mean right there just just enough just enough to get the silhouette of the sandbag down yes yes yes yes i want to make sure the sun is are hitting these guys just right so i might cheat and bring them out a little bit more so the sandbags are really hitting the sun there we'll render region again and maybe that's not the move but hey let's let's give it a little experiment we're here right let's push it out those are some sketchy sandbags right on the edge of that maybe we split the difference just a little bit like that is not bad that is not bad right there and then what we can do is mess with the color settings so in the color correction let's go gamma point eight to just brighten it up a little bit saturation probably come down to 0.8 as well brightness maybe 1.2 just so that they're a little bit more visible saturation 0.7 perhaps and those are looking like some sandbags up there maybe a little too bright maybe a little too bright we'll keep that at one and then for the machine gun i'll probably switch that out when i'm you know rolling solo but for now what i can do is essentially just have a placeholder machine gun i'll hold ctrl with the sandbag selected and let go on a cylinder and w will switch between world and local orientation and i'm going to rotate this guy and bring this in a little bit and i'm going to kind of go after like a 50 cal machine gun situation and we'll bring it in and i will control drag it up to duplicate it scale it down bring it out like this and probably give it just a little bit of like a muzzle here scale it up bring it out and we'll rest it just up against the the sandbags i'll group all this stuff here and let's give it a black glossy it's a gun metal essentially is what we're going for and we'll adjust this to like a dark gray with a little bit of roughness something like that and we'll set that up against the sandbags and we could even tilt it down at the robot and this kind of machine gun situation would definitely be let's see it'd be more of a box right here um bring this in and down something like this and then you'd have like two little handles on the back i guess but that's probably good for now you know we can just to give you the idea we could maybe scale this down this will be like the feeding ammo belt that got flipped up or something but then your silhouette isn't reading like a silhouette anymore so we can we can delete that you guys get the idea right so i could build that out later i have a bit more time i mean we have all the time in the world i just don't want to bore you guys with these little things i want to model a machine gun right now so a little story element there i'll tweak that up and then let's add some like shells you know some not like seashells but shells like gun cartridges bullet cartridges let's add some of those to the foreground so i'm gonna make one of those real quick hitting s to snap my view to whatever i have selected um let's bust out a person a figure so that we can see the scale of what we're doing here and let's go ahead and scale this down a lot i'm going to go for a 50 cal shell so pretty big that way you can actually read them in the ground we're going to go for a larger one just to for clarity's sake and i'm going to make this as low poly as possible so n b is your shading mode here um and let's go height segments will be 0 rotation segments 12 and we can make it editable by hitting c and come up in here and let's make some cuts kl and we'll get the little back piece essentially back here ul is loop selection move that down just a bit uh in edge mode hit uh ul to select all those i'm sorry in um polygon mode yep hit d for extrude and whoa s to snap your view to whatever you got going on oh i need to adjust my mode so you see i'm clipping through here i'm clipping through this model if you hit control d uh in your project settings if you set view clipping too small it'll take care of that for you so hitting d will scale this down just like that and then let's go ahead and grab these guys mw is extrude enter we'll bring that in maybe to about here we'll bring it in again and we'll bring it in again and that's the primer and then in one more time so we essentially want these two channels right here and we'll hit d and we'll bring those up just like that so you kind of have this like shell casing with the primer in the back now up here it's going to taper off very specifically so what we'll do is hit kl in in edge mode we'll make two cuts one and one and let's go ahead and extend this i'm hitting um in point mode i'll hit zero and i'll select all that we'll just bring it up something like that now in edge mode we'll grab these guys we'll bring them in just a little bit and then we'll take everything these three and we'll bring those in but if you notice i bring these in actually no i just want the top two just the top two bring those in just enough yep and then we can delete these ul delete edge mode grab this t for scale hold ctrl to make new polygons and hold ctrl again push them down just perfect and we want to bevel it because we want it to catch the light this is gonna be a trick here actually let's do it with a modifier so i'm gonna select the cylinder hold shift on the modifiers grab a bevel modifier and let's take the offset to point one point there we go 0.025 0 subdivisions is fine but that's going to get all this good stuff in here and it will uh bounce some light around it'll catch some some light and have them catch the eye just a little bit shout out to all you guys up in here 732 people in the live stream thank you guys for joining me it's a little bright isn't it let's see let's turn this down ah you guys doing okay thumbs ups if you guys are hanging in there if you're having a good time thanks for hanging out with me uh working on some art all right all right so by a show of hands or known by a show of smiley faces who is still working on their submission i know i am vfx wizard dude i am so excited for your art um i saw you working on it in the discord server you were doing a little live stream in the discord server my goodness dude i am amped for that nico's asking will you stream the judging for judging for the contest absolutely next week it's going to be myself ian hubert peter france and ren wykman and four of us are going to live stream um the top 100 pieces of art we're going to review them we're going to judge them we're going to grade them and we're going to get down to the top five the following week we're gonna do the top 100 montage as well as everything and the everything montage is gonna be like an hour and a half long that's why i'm doing two um and for those of you look wondering no we're not just judging the top 100 um this is confusing how am i going to say this we're judging all of the submissions privately we're going to go through all of the submissions privately it's going to take a long time and we're going to choose the top 100 submissions from everything and then we're going to take that and we're going to on the live stream determine the top five so that's what that's what we're doing it looks like we got some people who are still uh trying to submit their renders i look forward to it we got 700 plus submissions right now guys i did the math i've been asking you guys to provide me with the amount of hours that it took for you to complete your renters we're not just in to the day's territory like if you took all the hours that all of you guys spent on all of these renders and you added those hours up it is beyond days it is beyond months and it is beyond a year we are at four and a half years worth of collective effort for this big old montage that is insane guys that is unbelievable and i cannot wait to share with you guys in two weeks all of this stuff put together it's gonna be sweet be patient right because it's gonna be awesome i have a very good friend who just completed the music for the top 100 montage um it sounds amazing he wrote two custom songs for the montage and they sound freaking sweet um he is a good good good friend of mine he will be the best man at my wedding um so i am honored to have him do that i'll announce next week who the musician is but uh red of paw i see you i love your submission my fiance loves your submission very much but i thank you for the super chat um so yeah great choice of judges i think so too the four of us have a really good relationship and a really good like energy together so it'll be a good time for everybody it'll be a goofy time um there's so many great pieces i've seen so far and folks really pushing themselves absolutely dude like you guys it's so cool to have you guys learning through all of this that's the whole point of all this stuff the whole point of all these streams is for us to learn and grow together and you guys have been doing that the last month very very inspiring for me to see like super sick and um art bit thank you for the super chat says here's to um the corridor few and ian cube art cheers very nice the corridor few that's a good that's a good one all right y'all let's uh let's get back to it the musician is not casey edwards casey edwards is my go-to composer for literally everything i create he did the music for the last uh parallel dimensions render montage but this one is gonna be a new one this is a new musician new artist for you guys who's been around for a while been around about as long as i've been making videos so i'm very excited to either um if you don't know this artist to get you know introduce you to this artist or if you know him then it's gonna be sweet okay let's get back to it y'all we're making this little shell casing uh-oh here one second pen tablet thingy all right so this should be good we can all we can adjust this we can alter this you know later based off of reference or something but to the best of my knowledge this is about what a 50 caliber shell casing looks like something like this so i'm gonna take this and disperse it all up in here and we'll do it on the let's see let's scatter it we're at 1.5 gigs of vram left my goodness this is so this is going into story mode this is this is a story element we're adding to the scene here all right so we're going to do an octane scatter and it's going to be let's call it 100 count for now it's going to be on the surface let's drop the shell casing into the octane scatter oh no no no wrong way wrong way uh-oh i did it backwards i didn't put the shell casing in the octane scatter and the octane scatter goes onto the surface so whatever this is looks like a mud layer right here let's grab that and that is where we're going to disperse it so it's gonna be the chunky mud it's gonna get dispersed onto chunky mud amazing all right octane scatter chunky mud collab bam we got some shell casings all up in here now we want the shell casings obviously to be sitting on their sides so let's take that and rotate it 90 degrees and i'll just recorrect my gizmo and that should all update so that they're lying on the ground amazing and i want to push them into the dirt just a little bit and give it some random rotation so with the octane scatter selected let's go ahead and grab a random effector here and let's drop that into the effectors tab in the octane scatter we'll go to the parameter we'll uncheck position and let's just mess with rotation for a second and we'll rotate these guys around let's see octane scatter random effector is going to rotate all these guys differently sweet andre yo thanks for the chat man thanks for the help um so he says how how about you make a storyboard and we all make a movie together that changes styles through the scene yes yes yes yes dude i've had this idea so there's a there's an idea called um shrek retold and basically everyone takes a scene from shrek and um and like re-does it in their own style so what i want to do is write a movie write a short film i mean a movie would be sweet write a movie and each you you know you break it down into storyboards and you have all these artists make a piece of the movie and we make a movie together like that would be so sick and you get people to score it you know like i'd hire casey to score it then i'd hire like my buddy kevin to sound design it um and you would just make it a full legit movie and then like we would i would hire voice actors i'd get the best actors i could find like how cool would that be i really want to do that like that is that is something that i would seriously invest my time in so that's a great idea andre i 100 agree and have been thinking about that for a while so yeah eventually we're gonna do that i would love to do that with you guys um is it too late to start the challenge now will you have until june 1st to drop in the final so maybe if you crunch super hard octane scatter let's bring these guys down underneath the floor just a little bit um or maybe let's see negative 20 will those disappear i don't think so negative 50. they're just hovering you know they're hovering i want to push them down into the ground a little bit more so let's go ahead and render regen let's render this little bit here let's grab um grayscale gorilla let's go to their plus library and i'm pretty sure they're going to have like everyday materials brass yeah brass worn let's go with that and we'll throw that onto the shell casing so they're just these little gold pieces throughout the environment super cool we can probably take down let's see universal we go octane with it glossy that looks really ugly let's go back to what it was and let's just mess with the saturation probably 0.5 and we can you know really come in here and tweak this up i don't know maybe point point six and we could take that and let's set it to cubic yeah so it's just wrapped a little bit tighter a little bit nicer okay and then i still want to push them down a little bit so we'll go to distribution keep away i think keep away is what we want set that to 20 they're not moving the count let's go count like 200 a normal align so they're not moving they should be moving let's go let's just like group all that stuff into a null and then we could push it down maybe like minus five why errors and glitches y'all so they look a little large definitely so i'm probably going to bring the shell casing down like 0.7 across the board i don't know why it's not doing anything so here's what i'm gonna do instead of octane scatter let's do it with the c4d cloner so c40 cloner we'll go to object mode ooh give it a minute to update here okay we want render instance we want an object mode here and the object is the ground right like we talked about chunky mud bam we'll drop that in it's going to do a thing eric while we wait thank you for the super chat i appreciate the support says hey clint how many thousands do you think i need to cash app sam to get the photo scan of nick's head at this point oh my god dude that's hilarious uh i have no idea my goodness i have no idea you want that shrimp head dude that freaking photoscan shrimp head oh boy yeah that's a good question that is a very good question how many shrimps do you need to send to nick to get a photo scan of a shrimp photo scan nick head for those of you guys who have no idea what i'm talking about welcome to the stream happy saturday happy weekend everybody eric thanks for the chat dude all right we want more shells we go to 100 and you can see how they're all oriented in the same direction that's no good um we want to throw the random effector on there so once octane catches up and starts thinking oh pardon me all right render instance uh multi-instance perhaps maybe that'll go a little bit faster okay and then with the cloner selected let's throw that random effector on there or just pipe this one that already exists and we'll mess with these settings just a little bit so yeah a little bit of random orientation here but mostly here so this will be like 1080 so they're all just kind of in different directions and they're so large i think they definitely need to come down a little bit even though we scale them up to about a person we need or we scaled them using a person as reference i think we need to go for what looks best versus what might be the most accurate and i think it's just octane being buggy right now because it's pushed to the max and i think i'll give it the old re-render if you guys have any questions for me let's re-render our scene and let's answer some questions why so much noise that's because it's from the frame one of it trying to trying to render philip asks what my gpu is that would um be in the description of the video my pc specs eric how's my day going my day's going pretty well man i'm very happy with the render at this point um i've been working on it pretty hard this week and i'm gonna probably get together with my buddy cliff and we're going to maybe do a little bit yoga play some drums it's going to be a good day yeah man thanks for asking are there going to be more render challenges yes there will be more render challenges i'm going to announce one sooner than you would think and it's going to be different and it's going to be exciting and there's going to be prizes um where did i get the building models i got those from turbosquid um smarth watched my modeling video recently what are you doing nowadays to improve your modeling well i'm not really i hadn't really done much modeling since then i've been doing a lot more environments because that's really where my passion lies is in environments so when i need to model something if it's very specific and if i have time i'll certainly do so but you know i'm i am not opposed to downloading assets and using assets to make my stuff look nice that's what they are there for jason dude thank you for the support he just wants to say uh hello and that i'm a cool dude you're a cool dude for being here thanks for hopping on the stream and uh i hope you have a good weekend as well thank you for the support man it means a lot i appreciate it any other questions y'all take a couple more questions and we'll get back to it did you go hiking again when did i go high i went rock climbing um last friday i went rock climbing and boy that was fun i learned how to tie ropes and tie anchors and if you mess that stuff up you will die so it was a little scary i'm not gonna lie it was it was it was scary learn how to do that stuff um my goodness hans yo what's up dude welcome back good to see you again man um very good to see you so i if i'm not mistaken i think you are in the contest as well hans maybe i saw your name on the submission sheet but you say um let's be honest here how many blue screens have i had um if i was speaking honestly i would say zero zero blue screens um which is great octane has crashed a lot c4d has crashed a lot but i've had no blue screens so that is good will i review whips on twitter maybe we'll see if i have time um what's my opinion on less powerful programs um such as source filmmaker i think you you can make any program you want do what you want to do um it is it is yourself not the tool all right it's about you what can you do with what you got what is my secret tip to making renders look cool um a vignette around your scene um make it a little bit darker than you think shape the light use flags to shape your light block what i mean by flags block your light don't make your your whole scene just bright shape your shadows use it use your flags um add a little bit of film grain afterwards so it doesn't look like a render what else um bevel your edges so light catches the edge of the things that you bevel there's no such thing as a sharp 90 degree corner in real life so bevel them edges what else attention to detail use reference my god please use reference you gotta study reference to know what the real thing looks like so you can recreate it that's how you make it look nice what else what else what else um i don't know those are the main ones uh make some concept art ahead of time if you're going for a big old environment like i'm doing here it helped me help guide my way just a little bit just enough just enough but uh i think it's about time oh we keep on going let's get back to it looks like we got some subscribers popping off right now thank you guys hey look let's be honest if you're back for the second live stream in a row and you're enjoying yourself and you are not subscribed already then freaking hit that subscribe button right now join me every week we're doing cool stuff i promise you'll be inspired and if you haven't already like the video do leave a comment if you can good stuff classic stuff you guys know how to use youtube so the shells are looking kind of cool they're nice little touches to the scene i think they're just a little too saturated probably so i'm probably gonna get up in here desaturate it just a touch point five maybe and maybe i'll have a couple more maybe two hundred and we'll adjust the seed a little bit so we have a couple more in the foreground and yeah there's just enough to catch the eye in the render like what are these little like things here it's like oh snap they're they're machine gun they're freaking like bullet cartridges my god what happened here and that's exactly what i want the viewers to ask themselves when they look at the render i want their their brain to go take you on a story i want to guide you guys through a story with the render it's not good enough um sorry it looking great is not good enough you need a story and you need that 20 extra spice to it um so i'm trying to find that right now just because i added bullet cartridges um to the muddy ground doesn't mean it is unique and a crazy different story but i'm hoping that this palinking situation which is a if you guys are just joining me i went over this twice already but it's basically a a box that's carried by two servants so that the the royal whoever can sit in this box and not walk wherever they're going that's a palinkin i'm gonna make a high-tech gold version of one so i think i'm gonna start with that i'll kit bash one of these so let's um save our scene let's open up a new scene render that get some fresh vram for us ah ah feels good all right let's see what we can do here um there's a guy named vitali bolgarov and he's got some freaking amazing kit bash assets so this can be 3d models vitali bolgarov and we got some kits from him um maybe let's see hmm we want to drag and drop into the scene here floors perhaps minimalist sci-fi environment jpeg preview so i'm wondering if i could make some sort of sci-fi box from this stuff these are amazing definitely check them out vitalebulgrab.com you can see it right down in here italibolgarov.com his um assets and packs are totally worth it i don't know if this is going to be what we need maybe a sci-fi megastructure we can use pieces from this i could maybe see some of it being built from like this kind of stuff this is all really cool high-tech awesomeness eric your super chat didn't pop up did i not shout you out eric nah eric i saw you i shouted you out buddy i saw you man oh it's the second one you had a second one you had a second one ah i see i see okay thanks for the shout out you say much love don't forget the va the vegan tacos and chai i'll buy you when i go to la next year heck yeah dude that sounds great vegan tacos and chai i'm down for that dude that sounds like a hoot thank you for the support man i'll i got you with the vegan tacos and chai that sounds like a good time all right so maybe stuff like this i don't know we can make a helen keane out of this stuff hmm [Music] good times maybe we try it with this let's drop it in hey by the way guys fun fact if you shift drag anything into your scene it will merge it as opposed to making a new project artbit yo dude thank you thank you man for that super chat very generous of you you say um you know you should be in the palin or you see you know who should be in the palinking the robot from the boss time dynamics video yes yes yes yes i thought about this last night while i was like taking a shower i was like it should be the boss town dynamics robot i kind of like 100 agree um he is the reason for the robot uprising he got sick and tired of it i think that makes the most sense that definitely makes the most sense dude so let's see i know these things are supposed to be large but um we might be able to repurpose them i'ma group them all i'm gonna make an octane environment here right click hdri plus we'll drag the texture tag boom into the plus tag it will open the plus library and let's grab i don't know ultimate skies that looks freaking cool and we'll adjust the gamma on that and heck just because we're here let's go kodachrome 25 looks really cool 1.5 gamma and exposure 2 just so we have like we can see a little bit more maybe three 2.5 i don't know just so we can see what's going on oh shoot ah maybe this stuff dang it pen tablet thing again one second oh these pipes are nice oh i could use these i could just use these for the render snap oh that's so good this grating yeah i could definitely see where all this would be used so i'm just trying to get a sense of like what pieces look the best because this palinkin is essentially going to be probably this big maybe a little smaller because if this character here was sitting in a chair something like this and he's reclined just a little bit you know and then you had your arm out the window something like this you know and then this arm just doesn't really matter because you're not going to see it and you put this this dude essentially like up in this box i just want to make sure the box is big enough so we can go x-ray mode on the box if you go to basic scroll down you can do x-ray mode something like that yeah maybe you can go a little smaller or something but that feels about right to me if you're going to be chilling up in here um we can make this editable and we'll basically just block out what this would look like so you could have uh a window basically a little viewing window up in here bam uh we did two cuts amazing and we can open these up just like a little bit like that and then you have another two cuts like up in here something like this that's your viewing window your figure is up in this thing chilling with the arm out like this and the box itself would probably be have some thickness to it you know chilling just chilling in the box and then gold rings and everything you know on that um now we could also take this box and i i want it to be mysterious i don't want you to quite see like it's gonna be something like that yeah something like this amazing and like on the bottom since it'd be a hover palinking let's go ahead and grab the cube and let's make uh holding control yeah let's bring one of these guys down boom and it'll be like a nice little like hover hover box hover platform thingy something like that yeah i thought about it have him smoking um i think if it was a uh a cyborg cyborgs are a mixture between a human and a robot right so if it was a cyborg it would make sense if it was smoking so you have like you'd have like a cigarette basically between its fingers and then it like would go for a puff and then you would see a silhouette of a human face inside i think that would be cool but i do want it to be a full-on robot inside so i'll probably won't have it be smoking but i definitely did think about that platinum pug good question will my name on the render compilation be my discord username um no i'm not going to provide anyone's discord usernames or emails i am just going to provide any social media links that you have sent me so if you tell me that your youtube or your instagram or your twitter is a certain handle i'll do those i'll put those next to your name on the render montage just so that people if they're watching the video they like your art they want to go find you they can do it easily but no i'm if you don't provide any social media i'm not going to put anything besides your name that's all i'll put ooh the idea of it charging that's interesting maybe there's a battery pack on the back there's like a dual battery pack situation on the back or something like this i feel like you wouldn't see those though if it's going to be attached to the main character though it would need some sort of like maybe there's like a cargo thing on the palanquin as well so there's like kind of little cargo pieces or something here but i don't want it to be i want it to look as royal as possible and want to prevent as much like you want it to look as nice as possible if you're rolling up into town on one of these you're going to want to roll up in style and you don't want to have dirty bags on it so i don't know i i could mess with it and it'll probably take a while to get the vibe a rusted tesla supercharger that's interesting that's very interesting yeah and then maybe like attached to a little like pulling handle or something here because there'd be one there and there'd be one on the back as well maybe or like a cage for that you could put if we hold ctrl and rotate you make a new one this is just a rough block out and the character would essentially be pulling from like straps or something attached to this bit something like that i'm not sure solar panels on the on the roof that's not a bad idea so now i i definitely want to want to make sure i'm going between style-wise it'll be a blend between like i don't want to be super done up and crazy i want it to be elegant and simple so i have to figure out the balance between that because you know we can go to town we can start adding like different antennas and radar dishes and all this stuff to it but like i just think the fact that it's pure gold is insane like it's one like straight up like king tut you know where it's super ornate absolutely beautiful the resources spent to make this rent were just insane um with a slight sci-fi touch that's what i want so i think right now with the battery packs and the solar panels and the antennas and the hover box it's just like too much sci-fi just a little bit like it's like as if the robot got like repurposed a an old school like king tut palinkin or something um and threw a couple different like little pieces onto it or something that could be cool bride polkey interesting what is this let me what is bride paulky whoa that's pretty intense you imagine rolling up like this that'd be super serious i wonder if they had uh let's see king tut palinkin did he have one i guess he kind of did oh it was a chair he'd roll up in his chair that's intense look at that just pure gold that's insane um and then there's like the japanese palinkins that's a tiny little box but it's so ornate that's crazy you couldn't get me on a chair like that that would feel so awkward dang that is creepy yeah something like this where it's like black and gold and like really cool looking super ornate but very simple it's a very simple shape that's amazing so i'll probably get rid of these probably get rid of that so let's see how much visual weight this takes up so if i were to copy this over and bring it into our scene so i'm hitting nc basically the the key binding n will allow you to change your shading method so i like to switch between n a which is lit without the wireframe nb is with the wireframe nc is unlit without the wireframe and nd is lit with the wireframe so nc is my favorite it actually allows me to navigate through the viewport a little bit easier and um i also you guys can see that my textures are off too so that's nq if you look all the way down at the bottom it's a tiny little window but nq for materials i'll turn those off but let's paste in this palinkin and see what it looks like if we bring our character in um let's see how this goes down something like that perhaps and this will track with let's see with the character so let's go frame one boom all the way to about there i would assume yeah that's about right so if i hide my character because you know something like that i'm just worried it's gonna take up too much visual weight from the background and it's going to block a lot of the background that's the only reason i wouldn't do this so let's go ahead and render this it's going to take a minute and while it renders i will answer some of y'all's questions so if you guys hit at punisher right here in the chat um i can answer your questions and seem a little bit easier yeah it's kind of like a rickshaw rickshaw has wheels it's like a rickshaw without wheels so instead of wheels it's like another person in the back um that's the idea of the palinkin i guess it's a little less bumpy or something why would a robot carry another robot in such a human way i think it'll be a person the main character would be a human it would probably make the most sense and mike yes i did announce the judges it's going to be myself ian hubert peter france and ren wykman the four of us are going to go over the top 100 submissions on next week's live stream and announce the five winners of the alternate demand or no that's alternate realities render contest what else do we got what else do we got um am i gonna do an unreal live stream soon i have a plan for um a piece of art that i'm going to do in unreal engine 5 and i'm going to do a whole breakdown of how i do that but that's not going to be um probably until another couple months because i have a lot planned out for the next like basically two months for this channel and it'll be a part of that but it'll just be a little bit later probably end of july august time um let's see what else do we have here um do i ever look at the showcase channel in discord sometimes sometimes i do recently i have not just because i've been you know tracking this challenge the cg challenge um but yeah there's some amazing stuff in there you guys are killing it if you guys aren't a part of the discord definitely you know the link is in the description sign up it's free um yeah it's a great way to meet other artists like you guys like-minded artists that are trying to get better at what they're doing you know very supportive group of people you guys are very kind very helpful you guys keep it kid friendly i really appreciate that um how long do i think it'll take for my final render oh my god i want to do it in 4k uh resolution with like 1500 2 000 samples or something i'm probably going to have to send it out to a render farm that's probably going to be the best way to do it in the short amount of time that i have when will the next render challenge be a lot sooner than you think a lot sooner than you think so uh stay tuned y'all stay tuned subscribe if you're not subscribed already um have i used blender no not really any feedback on my render i'm quite nervous i don't know what your render is i'm not usually not giving feedback on renders right now just because there's so many of them it's very difficult to do so um have you decided on the criteria for judging the best renders yes yes i'm looking first and foremost for does your render look good like if i pull up a render and i look at the renderer i see like nice good lighting good quality um lit well you know like the very basic for the first second the render pops into my eyeballs the question is does it look good and if the answer is yes then that's the automatic like next step um this doesn't look good or does it have a style or a feel to it that kind of thing from there um i'm getting specific about it like how did you use composition how are you using lighting how are you using color um how are you using um like movement in the scene um beyond all those things like you know how is your render quality um you know that kind of stuff are there make sure there's no visible errors or glitches did you follow the rules did you leave the character where they're supposed to be did you have the spherical shape in the background um from there it's what is the style and tone that you're hitting and are you nailing it like what is the story that you have going on in your render and are you nailing it um is it more than just a cool image that's what i'm going for so cool image will definitely help you out but beyond that is what are you doing with that cool image so that's those are the general kind of uh the criteria for for judging all these renders hmm did i choose the judges yeah i i asked ian peter and ren um you know they were my first choices and they said yes so i was very happy that they all said yeah can you modify the sphere yeah i mean you guys can see that my render is uh i have a spherical silhouette going i need to adjust it a little bit to get have it be a bit more spherical on the left side um i'm gonna do that with some power lines and some wires and stuff so yeah that's my plan for that um what else um recently bought the imperfection pack nice dude i just wanted to say that it's so good and it saved me a lot of time and work heck yeah um i'm glad you like it yeah if you guys don't know i do have a surface imperfection pack that'll help you all make your renders look really nice and there's a link in the description if you guys want to check that out that's about it oh no there's a lot more um anthony thank you for the super chat i appreciate you man you said you spent only a few hours on your scene so much work this month to keep going do you have any advice to not give up two days from the deadline it's so frustrating hey man i feel you i was actually pretty bummed myself with all the different renders that i had i wasn't really a fan of my v1 i was like oh it's just the post-apocalyptic foreground who cares the v2 was it's a post-apocalyptic foreground and this hole in the background isn't doesn't look like a hole it kind of sucks um my v3 was the one where i was first like i was like uh even though i have these buildings back here they don't look that good like they look good they're good photo scans but it's just not really anything special this isn't special v4 was like uh i still feel like it's not that special even though the buildings look cool and everything just didn't feel right but the v5 slash v6 is where it really came together because my lighting i just spent like a day just a full day on trying to get my lighting good and really like playing with the positioning of all these pieces and stuff so i knew that i had to finish the render obviously because like i'm you know running this youtube channel and i have to you know i have to i have to come out with some sort of final product um you know if i was on my own doing it and it was like whatever like yeah it definitely helps to have a reason to push through to the end um this montage this video this render breakdown running my youtube channel having content to put on it those are all great reasons for me to like push myself to finish a render for you it might be this deadline is a great reason to finish the render another reason is also you want to be a cg artist and you want to make more renders and getting through this is going to help you go on to the next one so there's a lot of good reasons i think the more reasons you have to finish something uh the higher chance you will have of finishing it so i would definitely stick with it man i know that you're gonna get better when you get through the process and you finish the thing um yeah just just make some cool stuff man make some cool stuff and learn along the way that's all we're trying to do here what else we got a couple more super chats to get to evolver yo welcome back man every single stream you're hitting me up with uh with a little bit of support and that means a lot it's freaking awesome he says how um how to take my part time 3d work and make it full time how do you take part-time 3d work and make it full-time well keep doing the part-time 3d work until you can't do both and choose the 3d work that's kind of what i did at corridor i did the live stream stuff i ran my channel um as much as i could while working at corridor on the weekends right and then i got to the point where i was doing so much on this channel here i could not do both and i had to choose myself and i am so happy that i did that like it is the best i'm loving every second of it i love working for myself i love being able to spend the time to create the stuff i love doing also to take a friday off and go rock climbing like that's just the best so um yeah i couldn't have done it if i didn't live stream at the same time so i would just say do both at the same time it's gonna be hard it's gonna be difficult and you're going to spend a lot of your time working and again i can only speak to what i know and what i did which was that you know i did both at the same time to prove to myself that this channel that this live stream um is paying off and it certainly did and it certainly is and it just got to the point where like i can only do this for so much longer before like i have to choose i literally have to choose and yeah chose myself and it worked out it's definitely working out so that's a really good question evolver and jeremiah i see you man thank you sir for the support and the assistance you say love what you're doing here learning lots question uh what's the absolute latest i can submit my alternate realities rendering good question it's gonna be june 1st 11 59 p.m pacific standard time so june 1st june 1st is the deadline you have all of june 1st all of that i believe it's a tuesday pretty sure june 1st is a tuesday you have all of june 1st to finish your render so stay up late stay up till 10 pm deliver your render at 10 30 p.m um pst uh you have until 11 59 pm pst on june 1st as soon as you see your clock strike june 2nd it's too late so just make sure it's in by june 1st all right that is the that is the cold hard deadline all right you got to hit that i hope that helps you jacob jacob dalton yo what's up good to see you man freaking video co-pilot um rocket league extraordinaire thank you for the for the super chat man it means a lot we're gonna get that rocket league soon um i was just freaking it's been busy it's been busy working on these renders um and evolver thanks again man very kind of you that's two for one that's that's a that's an all-time record um but sweet dude yeah absolutely absolutely let's get back to it guys i'm glad i chose my channel too yeah i'm glad i chose the channel as well all right so the visual or the palinking takes up a lot of visual weight and i don't know if i'm happy with how much weight it actually takes up and it's actually blocking the sunlight from uh the foreground and it'll probably be blocking the sunlight from the character itself like it's kind of on the back here so i don't know part of me is like torn with that you know i could just be a traveler going through this area yeah a lot to see about that one i might be able to cheat it and offset them just a little bit that's a nice little cheat so you would take it and push it a little closer to camera to let some of that sunlight hit the character a little bit more since the you know since the characters are so stacked up against each other you can't really tell that it's just off center a little bit so i might do that where do i want to go from here so this war probably happened a minute ago so i definitely want to put some like grass and shrubs all up in this robot so we could probably scatter a few more plants and whatnot onto the robot itself or just maybe around it but i guess the question would be why um why would there be larger grass on the robot versus in the corners of this thing so maybe there's just like a few different pieces of grass and maybe there's some ivy going up the walls hmm there's just like a lot of small stuff to do on this i set off your alexa oh no did everyone's alexa just go off when i said that so the white circle right now needs work back here certainly maybe i'll do a little bit of that and it could just be me taking off this little piece here let's go into this guy and maybe it's just this little piece here hmm that's locked up why why is that locked up interesting okay it's this instance maybe if i turn that off that's a little bit more of that silhouette shape anthony thank you sir for the super chat what do you think about the render team system with otoy and render token have you tried it um i have not tried it but that's probably what i'd use if i'm gonna do a little render farm situation i'm probably going to do uh yeah the oh toy render farm thing um seems pretty sweet and it seems a little confusing but i know andre lebron has a has a tutorial on how to do that um what do we want to do today have one gig left one gig of vram left so i should probably use what we already have down here as far as foliage goes i don't want to use anything else i'll probably get rid of some of this stuff here that i'm not using i don't let's see let's see i wonder if i hide um the towers in the background if that'll save me the vram so these guys back here skyscraper it does awesome sweet so that's the back background so we can turn these off just for the time being and i'll put those in their own folder that's my background um background buildings we got ourselves like two more gigs that's nice that's very nice awesome um yo evolver thanks again for the super chat you say render is the cheapest you've done it hundreds you've done hundreds with render i'm gonna have to hit you up about that because i think that's what i need to do for this one here absolutely okay so let me open up i'm kind of all over the place today huh um let's do vfx materials 3d models cg trader antennas cranes electric towers industrial tanks okay let's open up electric towers and get these guys up in the scene because i would like to do a little bit of electrical tower action going off into the background so you probably take all of these and we can shift drag them into the scene shift drag them so they all stack up into the scene together and i agree the robot needs more color variation i think some black white orange maybe some yellow i think would be ideal i have to do this every time dang nice yeah i found these on cgtrader.com a bunch of awesome electrical towers totally worth it freaking love this kind of stuff it's so cheap too i think it was like like 10 bucks or something for all of these and i'm just kind of organizing these in order of height to see what we can work with awesome superior productions yo dude thank you for the super chat appreciated you saw on instagram someone's submission they modeled a velociraptor and rigged it themselves is that allowed i thought rig is touchy that is a touchy situation um i know you're talking about that's shutter authority um super good dude i actually know him personally um yeah i don't know that's like that definitely is a tough one um a lot of people have done legos they actually did uh like lego character and obviously a lego character can't have moved the same way as the um you know it can't really move the same way as a human so that's a bit tricky as well velociraptor is a little bit tricky and like some of these humanoid characters are a little bit tricky but as long as like it matches the uh the aesthetic and everything it i don't know it's it's tough i think it becomes a little bit more tough when they are up for like if they're gonna win or not then i'm gonna really have to like figure that out um if it's up to a potential winner i'm gonna have to that's why i have three other judges i don't want it to be just me there's too much behind all this at once you know um so you know the judges would know all the rules and they would say aunt you know can't really be a thing because they essentially like messed with the rig um so yeah we'll we'll have to see on that one i totally see what you mean i i know what you mean and i just want it to be as fair for everyone as possible so i'm gonna make sure i go over the rules make sure the rules are followed um you know on these on all of these renders and whatnot good question very good question palinking get out of here yeah there's a lot of star wars ones too super cool mmm okay yeah these are all really cool looking uh really cool looking models here maybe i'll grab this one the tallest one could be sweet kind of push this off into the background a little bit i'll give it a black texture so i can see it and it'll be pretty darn large here so the idea with this is that i'll have some ropes and stuff leading off into the background to accentuate that spherical kind of a look like maybe we'll have something like back here and they could just kind of like if i make an instance of this they could kind of trail off into the background nice so if we get essentially a spline going from like the top of this guy to the corner of this building then we can potentially have a situation where we have a nice line drawn here if we need it though i think like i got to be very sparing with it definitely um undead hobo yo what's up dude thank you for the super chat he says quick question is it within the rules if the sphere shape is outlined by a combination of foreground and mid-ground elements yeah absolutely that's kind of what i'm doing that's exactly what that's literally exactly what i'm doing um a lot of people have made the sphere out of um negative space and that's what you're seeing me do i'm making the spherical shape out of negative space um it's just a more creative way um to do it or just a different way plain and simple just a different way to do it so yeah that's what i'm that's what i'm doing puffy dude your render was so good i think you had the the titanfall one was that am i correct on that you had the titanfall render holy crap man that was incredible oh boy yeah that that was a good one um i think it's on twitter if you guys look on my twitter you can see it there it's really nice oh boy hmm um will the other judges make a render for the montage 2 i don't know um i doubt it i don't think ren peter or ian are hiding the fact that they're doing renders from me um but if they were obviously they couldn't win i obviously can't win um so yeah it'd be it'd be fair i wish they were doing renders for it'd be awesome william in the house everybody what's going on uh william good to see you dude he says hey everyone just joined um starting to look really nice yeah dude i think so it's uh basically at this point here i still have work to do definitely still have some work to do obviously it's missing the character but i'm really happy with my environment the robot needs um it just has a base coat on it it needs like more scratches it needs grunge it needs different colors probably some orange maybe some yellow black or white need some birds on it it needs some grass growing on it the little bridge needs work here in the foreground that needs a little bit more structure i need to break it up a little bit i need to adjust the sphere size in the background and make sure that that is like feeling right probably will choose a different hdri when it comes down to it to have a little bit more detail in the clouds um i'm working on top left little machine gun nest up there that's what was shooting down at this robot perhaps there's gonna be some cables and wires going off into the uh the um this little like cave essentially or this tunnel going off into there um and then all of the after effects dude after effects lots of after effects so i'm going to be doing like a bunch of different smoke cards and steam cards and atmosphere little passes on it so yeah that's where i'm at right now uh it looks like you guys have some other questions too uh stream the top 100 screening process too yeah that's exactly what we're doing next week for those of y'all who are just joining next week myself peter france um ren wykman and ian hubert will be um judging the top 100 renders and choosing the five winners from that pool that'll be next saturday it's gonna be a big stream it's gonna be a big one yeah we might break the we might break stream records you know and evolver i know dude how am i gonna do all this with a gigabyte of vram left i'm probably gonna have to separate my foreground and background elements i think that's the only way to do it i don't think there's any other way so i'll probably focus here if i were to uh let's see here geometry let's go down to my background building so i'd probably hide those to get some vram back and this building right here i would hide this guy as well so this would be my mid ground let's put that guy into the mid ground and probably hide that and the render looks very different very very different um i'm wondering if there's a way so i have seven second seven gigabytes now i'm wondering if there's a way where i can just like hide these from i don't know still have their uh let's see give those an octane tag visibility set to um so top 100 will only be reviewed live yes because there's too many guys we'd have to go through like a thousand renders that's literally impossible to do on a live stream that's gonna take so long it's gonna take us it's gonna take me the entire week to go through all these renders there's just too many of them you know that's just the way that's just unfortunately the way it is uh myself ian wren and peter are going to go through them all this week and we're going to choose the top five and then on saturday we're going to take the top hundred and go through now i might do something where like i somehow show them all i don't know how i'm going to do that though it's because like i said the it's going to be about an hour and a half if we just play them through it'll be an hour and a half if we just watch them and not comment on them um maybe maybe i'll figure out a way to do it but right now i don't have any ideas i know my mods are up in here they always help me out with ideas for streams and stuff so maybe we'll have a little mod chat we usually do once a week and we can figure out a way to maybe do all thousand ones i don't know it's gonna have to be a very quick process i just i don't know how that's gonna go down so okay yeah let me check how many submissions we have right now we are at 4.8 years worth of collective hours of work from everybody at least there's still people who have not submitted their hours um 733 submissions right now so far and i'm expecting to hit a thousand yeah we'll almost certainly break a thousand i agree with visual what are my thoughts on ian's dynamo my god that's one of the greatest if not no i'm just gonna say it it is the greatest um piece of short film art on youtube and freaking unbelievable the visuals are incredible if you guys know what i'm talking about just look up ian hubert dynamo it's a 20 minute thing he just released and it is insane it's absolutely ridiculous so much work went into that is three years worth of work he is the best world builder i know um yeah it's crazy this is absolutely insane it kind of reminds me of a wanker y movie if you guys know juan karwai he's a chinese director and um his movies are very like the pacing is very slow and it's all about the vibe and that's like ian but he's the like vfx version of one car y it's insane and yeah guys visual's right you can um you can still submit your hours if you already submitted but didn't type that in just go back and review the the um the submission form you can change and alter some of the answers being the hours that you put in oh snap the musician okay so the musician who did the music for the render montage the top 100 montage is calling me right now i'll have to hit him back after the stream he's just wrapping up the final track it's two tracks put together actually it's really sweet i can't wait to show you guys all right the main drain floor and the wall but i got all the scatter stuff going on corner shrub scatter let's get a little uh render region going on here awesome awesome so i'm trying to find the right shrubs to put all around this robot maxset tv hey man thank you for the super chat really nice of you says hey of course you heard about nfts from people for example and would you sell would you like to sell nfts i can help you with this small percentage i already sold five i've sold two so far yes i have sold two um and this will also be an nft yeah um i really enjoy it i think it's super cool and it's a really nice way it's actually it was never part of the plan when i left corridor but boy has it helped me stay afloat yeah certainly has helped me stay afloat and given me the opportunity to go off and create this art full time so i think it's really cool and it's only going to get cooler but thank you for the support i appreciate you all right let's see if we can scatter some plants around this guy that's gonna be the best way to do this maybe all right we just cut a little chunk out of this so we can do like a little bit between his legs and a little bit in front of him all right so i'll take that piece there and i'll break it off with um let's go back to polygon mode grab those polygons and we'll do probably a cut there we'll grab maybe these polygons and maybe these ones back up in here behind him so it looks like the you know we're actually growing some trees and not trees but bushes on this thing so i'll select those polygons that's what that's like the surface area where we want to grow these trees on bushes plants whatever we hit up break up up that's the hotkey for disconnect u p so now it's its own little piece right we can push that under the floor just a little bit and we can grow our stuff through that so that's floor one i'll call this robot scatter and we wanna let's see how are we gonna do this let's go with the corner scatter i'll duplicate the corner scatter and we'll bring it down in here i'll call this robot scatter and we'll change the plane the surface it's looking for we'll change that to robot scatter and if we turn it on we should have some scattered plants around our robot and we can take the count up maybe to 500. so we have a lot we have a lot scattered there but it's i can't really see it in the render so i'll take all those guys and i'm just going to scale them up hitting t scale it up and we have a little bit more shrubbery around our robot um max tv yo thanks again dude uh he says congratulations with your sales didn't know about that did you sell on foundation oversea um by the way good luck in the future sales thanks man yeah i sell on um super rare so if you guys want to see you know the two pieces it's super rare dot co slash punisher that's where i have my uh my crypto art up yeah just two pieces right now this will be the third sweet that feels pretty nice like it's very subtle it's definitely up in there just a couple little patches of grass and i could probably take this robot [Music] scatter and maybe pull this out just a little bit all right really connect it and then we'll push it down on the ground just a little bit and i think i'm probably just going to break up the size of this so we'll go to the robot scatter and for scale let's see how is it doing it with the ah yes okay so i'm using a noise shader so i'll copy this copy shader robot scatter and we'll paste it so we're adjusting the scale of these different pieces different little shrubs here and you can see that some are small some are big and if we adjust the contrast it'll adjust all that stuff too and that's just a way to get a little bit more of a random dispersion not as much you know i'm using area lights for my scene um i'm using a sunlight and i'm using actually here that's a good question the main light in my scene is a sunlight um i have it hooked up to an uh hdri environment which is like a gray the gray sky image that you're seeing and then um i have an area light basically right in front of camera here it's a large area light boom back here that's blasting so i can get a little bit more reflection off of this mud the sunlight is doing the work though from this angle i'm getting that sunlight blast and i'm using a bunch of flags to block a lot of that sunlight to really shape out the lighting of the scene and i'm gonna do a full-on like super stylized breakdown of this piece of art very similar to the mortality run piece i did um and i'm gonna go into how i lit it how i did everything um there'll be like a solid 15 minute video on how i did everything with this piece of art in about three weeks all right guys so definitely don't miss that so subscribe you know subscribe y'all that feels good to me on the on the grass if we brought out let's see if we brought out the robot scatter and we move this over just a little bit like this maybe there's a bit more grass in the scene just experimenting here with different different looks evolver dude are you serious if i sign the 6k you'll send the 8k that's a that's a steal dude if you're rendering too hard it might melt off the signature who knows but i appreciate the super chat and jones lab too man i appreciate you too thank you so much you guys are very kind so i know i need to texture up this robot a little bit more so maybe that's how we'll end the stream is i'll go in and i'll text up this robot i'll show you guys my process just a little bit here so let me let me try and open that up let's go mec walker give it a render hit it with some sunlight and combine it with the hdri environment which i would actually like to change let's grab one of these guys so yeah we got a blue a blue robot and i went into a lot of this during my um let's see how to turn yourself into a robot video i went over the texturing the surface imperfections the scratches the grain grunge noise all that good stuff and i don't know if i'll get super into that right now but you guys can kind of see that i have i do have a scratched surface here and the way i'm doing this um most of this is already just like this is a model i got off of cg trader and it came with the textures but i'm doing a little extra thing here where i am using a mixed texture between a chrome texture let's actually give that a little bit of roughness and the robot texture itself and i'm breaking that up with the specular texture it came with to give me a little bit more um scratched edges there just to spice those up a little bit more now what i want to do is actually give this robot different colors throughout his body so if we do you know we do a blue version um we can do a green version maybe or no let's not do a green version let's do a yellow version so if i were to drop this mixed texture will make a new mix texture and let's do here a hue change the hue to a yellow it's a greenish saturation i like to usually max out my saturation so i can actually see the color i'm like i'm messing with it's like an orangish and this might be like a yellowish color here it feels good to me and i will pipe that into this new mix texture boom and we could just get rid of that so now we have this new mix texture and if for whatever reason your octane textures aren't updating my face is blocking it right now down here but if you double click this little preview window it'll update it down below it's a little octane bug ooh that's cool yeah so i just want like hints of this it'd be mostly blue oh what the heck bear with me one moment while i get this texture back there we go cool so we want these little certain parts to be yellow so maybe the shoulders or something um let's go into unlit mode so n d i believe and c why is this all black i think it's probably because of the noise tag or the normal tag so if you select that and hit uw it'll select the entire piece so this is one piece you guys can see here it's one giant mech mesh and the best way to select the entire piece is to select one piece from it this is the best way i know i used to do ui which is gross selection and i just mashed this a bunch but i found out you can actually hit uw and that will select the entire thing so u w that's gonna be uh select connected is the command is select connected u w there might be a an option to select just an entire piece with one click i don't know of it but you know boom select connected and then you can start dropping on your pieces so technically since i'm only looking at it from this one side um we only really need to texture up this one side so i probably do a black version and i'll do a chromed out version so like the gun itself maybe will be like a gun metal um we could do like a darker version of this chrome so we can come into let's go basic we'll change it to a universal material we'll give it some metallic properties let's see we want let's see i wanted to be a darker chrome essentially maybe we go back to glossy the index we take pretty far up diffuse comes down to zero so it's black and the more we bring the index down the darker that gets and we can bring the roughness way up and the index down a little bit more and like this is kind of like your gunmetal texture here which you can just select oh uf is that the one uf fill selection uh uw i like is better because it doesn't you don't have to click or actually wait oh it's the whole thing yes uf that's a good one i like that so i'm going through and just selecting all these pieces so that'll be like our gunmetal it's like a giant arm these are pincers so these pincers can just be like titanium pincers and i'll go through this and just kind of give it a little bit more ram just like randomly deciding what color these should be so if these are like chromed out and i feel like we don't need to go too ham on the surface imperfections just because you know this robots me far away maybe these guys can be crummed out and it's really just have fun with it you know maybe the head could be white so you can actually tell it's the head and instead of yellow maybe we go for like an orange or something so i know this one actually wants to be black i'll take the saturation down to zero brightness to one and it'll be like a dark gray yeah we can take the gamma to like 1.2 and darken it up a little bit we'll copy that mix material and replace it with the new one here boom so now we have a black one and then we said we wanted to do hmm why they go white oh yeah we wanted to do a bit more of an orange so if we do this here let's go back to that hue and saturation what the heck why is it why is it doing this uh i guess it deletes so strange anyway i'll just i'll keep things easy right now let's stick to this one thing at a time i'm all over the place yeah i think it looks a little cooler and yeah i'll just hit these like main panels with these colors here which looks nice oh maybe those are blue and like these guys here can probably be a maybe the gunmetal maybe the head is gunmetal too kind of like that a little bit nicer same for all these pistons and pipes these can be chromed out in here and these guys let's have that be orange kind of cool this piece can probably be that darker color so let me try this one more time um let's bring this out bring out the mix material we'll darken this up saturation zero brightness one gamma 1.2 yes and we'll apply that to this mixed material i'm not going to delete it this time i'm just going to replace it and we'll drop that on there sweet we can darken it up even more brightness point five maybe even point two awesome and we can kind of just fill in like the darker areas with that black metal to essentially what you're doing is like just accenting certain pieces so the more like core parts of the robot can be that dark metal color and i'm really not worrying about the other side because i'm only seeing this robot from one side nice oh the missile pods that's super cool those could probably be the chromed out bits and this could literally be whatever color you want any style you choose these this little backpack jetpack situation could be mostly black and the backpack piece can be chromed out or maybe the gunmetal and the antennas for sure will be darker nice okay the feet can probably be darker as well and yeah this this is the process you know it's just the process let's see what this actually does here let's see what this looks like okay so i'm gonna copy this oh i actually wonder if i can just copy all of this stuff and paste it onto the existing robot to get the color let's see if that works all right so it brings in a new mesh and i'm wondering let's see if i take all this and drop it on to the existing one if that will actually work i hope so it should in theory that should definitely work let's give it a render and see what happens well that goes i'll answer any questions you guys have i think that's uh probably going to be it for me today um you know i'm taking a little break here come back keep working on my render and keep plucking away at these details thank you guys for for joining me um and if you don't know already by this point next week is the live stream where myself ian hubert peter france and ren weichmann all get together and we are gonna go over at least the top 100 renders to choose the top five winners we'll see what we can do we're going to have at least 1 000 submissions right now there's 733 with about just under five years worth of total collective hours worth of work between all of you guys that's a lot that's a lot so we're gonna do our best to go over as much as we can without you know having it be a 12-hour stream all right we want to keep it under four hours if we can absolutely um let's see all right so questions on the stream post the circle is not very circle are you going to adjust that yes i'm going to adjust that i'll make it more of a circle um did i model the robot no i got the robot from cg trader that is my favorite website for um for 3d models cg trader the what the prices are actually very affordable and reasonable turbo squid can get a little pricey but you know it's actually it's not that bad because or it's not that unreasonable because i understand why you would want to charge a lot of money for all the hard work that you have put in so yeah that makes sense hmm i should learn quicksilver mixer really easy and really fast way to texture and can literally drag in two megascans textures and they will be it will blend perfectly i do need to learn quiksil mixer um i use qixel enough to be able to justify that so i think that's a good idea should probably get on that um what was my render time well i'm doing low res low sample renders that take probably a couple hours but my 4k full res full sample render will probably take 20 to 30 40 minutes per frame and i have an extra 150 frames in my render so it's 300 so it'll be a lot it'll be a lot where do i stand on an oreo cookie are you the guy who did the oreo render because the guy who did that oreo render would ask that question i like me good i like me a good oreo i don't buy them but if they're around i'll have me in oreo what software would i recommend for creating sprawling landscapes um i recently got into a program called uh world creator and it is unbelievable i'm using it for a render that i'm working on that you guys hadn't seen anything yet it's just like a low-key backseat render i'm working on that one i use world creator and it's really cool it lets you shape the landscape and use filters to like get the most realistic looking environments possible it's crazy i used it for this too with the whole but i eventually took that hole out um necco why do i have an extra 150 frames in my render well that's because my um my render is going to be kicking off the render montage videos it'll also be ending it so what i want to do is create a tone create a vibe i'm going to do some sound design for my piece and get people like seated down looking at something really cool and then it's going to cut to all of your guys's so that's why why mine is a little bit longer is so that um it essentially sets the tone and it sets the vibe and i need a little bit more time to do that i did it with the last render challenge as well i made it i think a little bit longer and i slowed it down a little bit but you guys definitely without question needs to be 150 frames 30 frames per second do you think we can hit a thousand submissions i absolutely do think we can hit a thousand submissions what else we got what else we got y'all any other questions yeah that's a good one um thank you guys for joining me um downloading a model or creating from xero what do you recommend for beginners uh it depends on what you want to learn guys i have learned a whole bunch by creating models from scratch i've also learned a whole lot downloading models and placing those models in my scene like that's that's you'll learn a lot more on composition you're not trying to i like the way blender guru said it he's like if you modeled the book stand and the in the the books and the coffee table and everything like in all the little details you'll certainly feel a lot more satisfaction in your final result because you've done everything from scratch it'll take a lot longer but what blender guru is saying is that you are trying to present a arc viz style render you're trying to present an environment all right and just because um you know if you modeled everything from scratch that's amazing but i don't think there's like an issue with downloading assets the assets are there for a reason uh for you to download and for you to use people make assets for a reason because they know that people don't have all the time in the world now if you're making a video game there are some times where you can download the assets for games other times it might be something you create from scratch as well it just depends depends on the situation if you're beginner wanting to learn how to model then certainly model your own stuff if you're a beginner trying to create interesting landscapes then make as many interesting landscapes as you can you want to iterate and you want to you want to get through as many interesting landscapes as possible you want to do it as many times as possible because you're going to learn through that experience and if you're sitting here like doing one environment every year because you modeled everything you're going to learn a whole lot i promise you but if you want to really like make your education as potent as possible to specifically working on environments then you need to just be creating environments constantly so it's it just depends it certainly just depends um while i do a stream with people maybe one day maybe one day but not in the near future [Music] how many submissions were there last time there were 125 submissions last time this time last i checked like 20 minutes ago there are 733 so there's going to be probably a thousand submissions and it's going to be awesome the final montage video is going to be huge and probably an hour and a half long will everyone be included in that render montage um yes everyone will be included in one giant hour and a half long render montage but i'm also going to be doing a top 100 render montage as well so there's going to be both so just depends on how much time you have you want to watch 100 uh you know an hour and a half long thing absolutely put it on at a party put it on the background put it up on the big screen and let it play you know while you work get inspired that'll that'll definitely be for that i'm gonna have music going for it custom music um not custom music but uh specifically i'm going to choose music that fits the tempo of the renders the top 100 montage will have custom music written for it it's actually already finished so i can't wait for you to guys hear that in two weeks where do you submit if you uh go to the discord to go to the info channel on the discord you'll see where to submit how do i select certain things as if it's a group of polys um you can select the polygon and hit u w or you can hit uf and use that tool to select chunks basically little parts what's my dream project what's my dream project to work on something that i am extremely passionate about with my friends and family that is the dream project um whatever the story may be as long as as long as i'm super passionate about it and my friends and family who are working on that with me together are super passionate about it then it's gonna be the best thing ever i know that for a fact hassan i'm not gonna play music in the stream i'm leaving that to you you can play whatever music you want over top my voice right now um i think the vibe would get a little repetitive if i played music on the stream but i have not uh i've gotten that request a lot certainly so guys i appreciate you very much um thanks for hanging out with me if you guys want to get some internet security for yourself check out nordvpn you know they're down in the description they help me out on this stream today made this one possible um if you guys click that link down there it's gonna help me out it's gonna help me do more of these and it's gonna
