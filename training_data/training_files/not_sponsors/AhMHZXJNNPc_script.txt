[Music] are you having trouble figuring out missions in starborn let me help you i'm nocturnal this is starborn the way that missions work in starborn is that they have a central mission point and hints which are hexes around the outside of the mission as you can see here i've got a few hints and no missions showing at the moment however these are all level one missions and i know this because these hints only extend one hex from the center so level ones are fairly easy to figure out basically all you need to do is grab your scouts right click on the center click explore and click send scan now go ahead head out there if there's a mission there it'll pop up just like it has now we've got a level one mission here and we're good no more hints because we've found the mission and if we were to do the mission now right click explore and it gives you the mission and the requirements one assault plate one escort fleet and a minimum of this much firepower now there's a couple of other things about missions that i need to mention uh secondly is these hexes here you can probably already figure out from what we've got here obviously two missions one is here one is here and this lighter patch here designates when there is overlapping in missions so uh we've got that here we've got this also happening down here you can see again with a little bit more experience you can see that there's a mission here right in this hex a mission here and then that's overlapping with this mission here which is also overlapping with this mission here and we've got another one that is not overlapping either of them over here so uh as your tiers of mission go up so do the number of mission hint hexes leading out from your center point mission now this is where things get a little bit tougher because when you've got level two or especially level three or higher missions it's a lot harder to figure out where the center is when there's so many more mission hint hexes around them that makes for a lot more overlap and it just makes it harder in general to find the last thing that i want to mention here is with regards to missions and the amount of scan strength you need in order to find them outright now this is an important one and if you go to any hex and go to explore and info it tells you down here that your mission hint stealth values which is also the probe strength that you need to show them up is just 100 for a level one mission that's just for the hints though if we scroll a bit further down to actually outright uncover that level 1 mission requires a minimum of 200 probe strength for level 2 500 level 3 600 etc so i can show you this now we'll just go to our buildings here and take this comms array up to level five now if we uh if we have a look here it says that we've got a scan strength of 200 and you'll notice that once we hit 200 this mission suddenly just appeared so uh that's because we have enough scan strength now on the base to automatically show up that mission if we were to take that even further up to a scan strength of 10 now look at this we can see all of these ones around here they are all level one missions um and uh make it a lot easier to find than having to use the hints now the uh the final word on missions and this is actually a pretty important one as well is that when a mission is completed a new mission will be spawned within four hexes of the old one and it may also have a chance of increasing in uh difficulty or interior to uh a higher tier so uh that's it as far as missions are concerned i hope that this has cleared things up for you and look forward to seeing you in the next video
