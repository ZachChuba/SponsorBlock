for all the sweat and the upcoming heatstroke I do think I deserve like a like and subscribe I'm just saying I'm currently here in Salvation Mountain in California and a 40 degree heat making your video on the shallowest and most vain topic of all it's the story I'm not happy with my life choices of how I got here right now because it's so hot and this topic is definitely not my favorite but I'm gonna show you how to use Instagram not just for the prefactor because there's a lot of videos out there on how to make Instagram really pretty but this one is about how to use it effectively for business purposes because I'm a business person I now see my social media as a business and I think you should too in order to stay sane and if this is not a business for you then you should see Instagram as a creative outlet that is all it should be so to kick this off because we are an Instagram land I am gonna reference my friend Jesse before this whole Instagram story thing I never used to go out and just shoot for fun basically every day he built up his entire career basically at the beginning through doing amazing killer insa stories so now he is transitioning to YouTube but that is besides the point I just love what he said though create content for the platform every single time don't regurgitate stuff that you've built for a different platform and put it onto a different platform it's just not optimised for it you want to optimize in sasori's for insta stories to get the best best best results from it so what kind of results are we actually talking about with these insta stories well I saw my insta stories for those each right now with the swipe pops to sell a product you can make easily thousand dollars just from one swipe up in 24 hours and with the swipe apps you can literally send thousands and thousands of people to watch your videos as well which is very very effective oh yes you should definitely concentrate on insta stories when it comes to the business perspective I freaking love that even the tires I painted it's so freaking dope this place is actually really really amusing amusing amazing my favorite Instagram apps that I recommend for you guys to get the 8-millimeter app for really nice vintage a delicacy feels why do I say that in so many videos now unfold putting two elements together I'm making your insta stories really pimp and professional kira-kira golden shiny stuff it's it's nice an actual edited DSLR footage I think this is the most effective and most beautiful but also the most time-consuming keep your insta stories to about 8 max like nobody wants to see those dashes at the top like don't be rude no one's gonna watch it it actually affects the conversion how many people watch your insta stories if they see too much straight up they're not going to watch it even eight is a bit too much so six to eight is roughly max you want to be pushing yet do the wow factor people I don't want to laugh be impressed by the beauty or learn something from your insta story so don't just put up crappy stuff put an effort into it wow people and you're gonna see the results the fastest so the same principles apply to insta stories as does for photography and Instagram and YouTube everything is the same you want the best possible lighting when you're using your is the story so don't do it in bad lighting or at nighttime no no no no no no no no no no if you're indoors find nice lighting go to the window Instagram is a visual platform if you want people to watch your stuff it's got to be pretty if you have something to say to Instagram you don't film it in one location like this is boring but if I move around for example that's already interesting in itself or if I do a little snippet here and I do a little snippet here and then I'll do a little snippet here already visually this is so much more interesting and people are gonna listen to you more because they're engaged because it's brilliant as the rioting and because we all have oh yeah we have the attention span of goldfish so if you want to keep people's attention you need to try really hard and visually doing it one of the easiest and fastest ways this video is sponsored domain or website so use your insta stories as a sneak peek as well for example youtubers if you've just released a video show people either using a really nice creative designed image saying that you've released a new video or show snippets of your video in the correct format full span on the screens that you've released a new video otherwise if you posted a new photo also do a sneak peek on your insta story drive people to see your photograph sometimes people only watch insta stories and not your photographs so you can do like a very small interesting sneak peek of your photos and get people to like and engage with that so I'm not gonna lie the longer I'm in this space the more annoyed I am at myself for making a video on this topic because this is actually such a beautiful space and there's so much love and the man that created this you literally just wanted to show people that god loves them the catch is that so it's all about love and Here I am like in story but you can use instance stories for the good so I'll just tell you so let's just go with that for a second here are a couple of ground rules which I think are really important this is what I would absolutely 100 cent do and stick to when it comes to Instagram firstly no one gives a [ __ ] about your ransom I'm sorry to say what you can do if you have a lot of rants and it's constantly in your mind and you want to get something out as a filmmaker my recommendation is save your rants don't just talk to them on Instagram because you're not gonna get through to anyone doing rants what you can do is create a passionate point of view into a short film and share it on YouTube it's gotta go so much further I am drip drip dripping with sweat it is so hot the next point is the smaller you are as an instagramer a creator unfortunately the harder you have to work why well because you have to impress people you need to give them a reason to follow you the bigger you get the less reasons you need we can get matching the yawn say for example putting an instant story up of her life like behind the scenes people would be like oh my gosh I just got an inciting to Beyonce's life but the smaller you are the more you have to wow people unfortunately that's the truth of it lots of people say that their life is not exciting enough to make people drool over their life and have something to put up on the insist or ease the thing is I learned that if you want to be an interesting person you have to become interested in your own life as well and Jessie for example he's just like a normal dude but he made the most insane insta stories out of his everyday existence he just made it happen he made it exciting and fun and you can do that for yourself as well but the biggest thing is do not act like anyone else like you are unique for you you are weird you're quirky or you're like serious and quiet and introvert extrovert it doesn't matter you have to rock with what you have do not copy because comparison is so with so do you boo and you're gonna find the best results out of that that is going for an individual or person stick to what the business represents sick - what you represent that is the most important ingredient of success and finally I just want to say a couple of things about Instagram one for your own sanity do not over share I went through this stage and that's why I now I see Instagram and my whole social media thing as a business it is a business or if it's just for fun use it as a creative expression do not get caught up in it because it's gonna drive us crazy and everyone experiences this so if you're not having fun doing something just don't do it take a break take a breather do it for enjoyment a really big thing when I use my insta stories and my Instagram as a social media person and I'm passing on this knowledge knowledge if you go to a beautiful location like this like scope it out have a look at it first enjoy your first and when you've done that then you take out your phone and you film a few into stories in your desired app and your desired style and you put it away and you edit it later at the end of the day get the full enjoyment out of this experience that communally on have already walked around this beautiful space and enjoyed it for what it is before I even took out the camera now I'm doing this video in a second I'll take some photos and then that's done but don't forget to live most important thing of all so I spoke to a YouTube representative the other day and they told me that I must say subscribe and like this video so apparently does help after all so make sure you like and subscribe this video if you do enjoy this I'd love to have you part of the family and check out my Instagram if you'd like to see more I've taken some beautiful photos at Salvation Army Salvation Mountain if you'd like to see and until next time blah that was really lame these just got into the car turns out it's a 120 degrees Fahrenheit outside that is 48 and a half degrees that is by far the hottest I have ever been in same here whoa
