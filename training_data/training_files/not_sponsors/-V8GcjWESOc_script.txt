redesigned 11 inch iPad pro starting at $7.99 and if you demand not only power and performance but the biggest screen size you can currently get you can go all the way up to the newly redesigned twelve point nine inch iPad pro starting at $9.99 that's still five or more stops on the flow though with room to fuss with the options in between so if you still need help making up your mind let's go a little deeper if you need an iPad and that's all you really know or care about if you're just starting out with tablets or looking to upgrade after a few many years if you just want to be able to do everything that an iPad can do from reading to watching to communicating to working to playing and you want to be able to do those things on the same iPad for several years to come then get the new iPad air it's got a 10.5 inch wide gamut Retina display with true tone ambient color temperature matching which is slightly bigger than the original iPad it also comes with apples a 12 Bionic chip set the same one in the iPhone 10's three gigabytes of memory a lightning connector touch ID biometric fingerprint sensor two stereo speakers a seven megapixel 1080p front-facing camera and an 8 megapixel white color F 2.4 also 1080p rear camera you can get it in silver space grey or Apple's current Capri gold with 64 or 256 gigabytes of storage and with just Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi and cellular so you can connect and share that connection to or from anything anywhere it's also compatible with the first generation Apple pencil Logitech crayon and Apple smart Keyboard for drawing and typing they do increase the upfront cost but also the functionality in other words the iPad air can do everything a modern iPad needs to do starting at the same price as original $4.99 if you need a first or just a new iPad and price is the most important feature to you if you're a student or a teacher or just want an iPad to work and play with part time something that does all the iPad stuff but just doesn't cost as much get the new 10.2 inch ipad 7 here's what you give up the screen is a bit smaller standard rather than wide color with no true tone so it can look slightly bluish or yellowish white depending on the lighting and non laminated so they can be more glare but it's every bit as high resolution and even though it's physically smaller it's ever so slightly heavier than the air it also has an older 810 fusion processor same as the iPhone 7 and an 8 megapixel standard color eff 2.4 also 1080p rear camera you can get it in silver space grey or the same coppery gold with 32 or 128 gigabytes of storage and with just Wi-Fi or with Wi-Fi and cellular it's compatible with the first generation Apple pencil and Logitech crayon and now for the first time the Apple Smart keyboard as well here's what game savings sure you get slightly less but if you don't need more you're also gonna pay a lot less starting at just 329 if you love everything about the iPad air but just want something smaller something you can tuck away into a jacket pocket or sure even the back pocket of your non skinny non hipster jeans that you can easily take everywhere and do well most things with then check out the new iPad Mini here's what you give up it doesn't have a smart connector like the air you can't get a tiny smart keyboard to go with it though it'll still work with any standard Bluetooth keyboard here's what you gain it packs all of that air tech and performance into a device with a 7.9 inch display that's only about two-thirds as much as the air that means it's got almost everything that's great about the new iPad air just in new iPad Mini shrunken down size starting at 399 if you need a new iPad and you want it for quote-unquote real work bracket close bracket TM if you're a pro photographer videographer audio producer or engineer designer or musician if time is money and power is worth any premium then you want the iPad pro here's what you give up the new iPad pro with its all-new design loses the bezels so there's less padding to hold on to but more palm rejection so it's not really an issue that also means it loses the home button and touch ID and replaces it with face ID which is less obtrusive but sometimes also less convenient and there's no gold finish option because pros are just way too serious for that here's what you gain a pro motion display that can dynamically ramp down to save power or up to 120 Hertz for silky smooth scrolling and animation apples a 12 X Bionic chipset that adds two extra performance scores three extra graphics cores an extra gigabyte of memory in the 64 gigabyte 256 gigabyte and 512 gigabyte models and three extra gigabytes six total in the one terabyte of storage model and yeah that one terabyte of storage model also in addition to USB C which provides support for all sorts of accessories including displays you get four speakers for stereo sound in every orientation a front-facing true depth camera with portrait mode and a 12 megapixel F 1.8 4k 60 frames-per-second rear camera with quad LED flash few you can also get Wi-Fi or cellular and the new iPad pro also supports Apple's a new second-generation pencil which connects magnetically to the side of the iPad pro and charges inductively it also has a new soft touch finish and you can tap it to change tools or do other simple toggles and there's a new simpler smart keyboard which also protects the back of the iPad it comes in 11 inches which is similar in overall size to the 10.5 inch air and a 12 point 9 inches which is the biggest iPad canvas you can currently get but thanks to the new design doesn't really feel that big anymore it's literally maximum iPad starting at $7.99 for 11 inches and $9.99 for 12 point 9 inches thanks notion and thanks to all of you for supporting the show ok I know that got a little complicated especially towards the end there so I'm gonna rewind and bring it right back to the beginning if you just want an iPad you can take pretty much anywhere and do pretty much anything with then you have the new normal the new baseline the new 10.5 inch iPad air starting at $4.99 if you absolutely have to have an iPad but you just can't or won't pay that much for it then you have the new 10.2 inch iPad no adjectives added starting at 320 million if maximum portability is most important to you and you're not only willing but eager to give up some screen size too then there is the 7.9 inch brand new iPad Mini starting at 399 if you want more power and performance but still a good amount of portability and premium is no problem then there's the newly redesigned 11 inch iPad pro starting at $7.99 and if you demand not only power and performance but the biggest screen size you can currently get you can go all the way up to the newly redesigned 12 point 9 inch iPad pro starting at $9.99 and if even that's still too much get the 10.2 inch iPad 7 at least that's how I'm
