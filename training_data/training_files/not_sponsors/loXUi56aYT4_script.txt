this episode is sponsored by the great courses plus this year's potentially one was groundbreaking and important discoveries ever made the wheel and its axle of course today it's so common and ubiquitous that we hardly think of its importance but this design is found nowhere in nature it had to be completely invented by humanity so today I'll be making this leap myself as well and attempt to literally reinvent the wheel and use its revolutionary concept to build a few tools there were direct developments from it everything we use comes from 8,000 generations of collective innovation and discovery but could an average person figure it all out themselves and work their way from the Stone Age to today that's a question we're exploring each week I try to take that next step forward in human history my name is Andy and this is how to make everything be sure to subscribe and turn on notifications so you don't miss the next step in this journey the challenge of the concept isn't so much the wheel part rolling things is pretty straightforward and can be witnessed in nature see acts afford to spin on that's a real challenge that's why the wheel likely wasn't invented until 3500 BCE after metal tools have been developed the more finely shaped the wheel and axle to the necessary sizes another event at this period that also helped drive this invention literally the domestication of horses and other pack animals in the Americas they had no easily domesticated animals to harness and the wheel never really took off and massive empires would be built in Ronn without the idea even spreading there's evidence showing they figured out the concept of the wheel but only ever used it for novelty toys however there was a good several hundred years from the invention in the wheel to its use with carrots and other forms of transportation the first driving force for the wheel was pottery likely first developed in Sumer Mesopotamia making it symmetrical ceramic containers and other items led to the first forms of the potter's wheel just a brown base they'll be slowly pivoted and allow the artist to quickly reposition their work this then evolved into a slow wheel that could be slowly turned while working on the item then after a few more iterations is turned into the fast wheel using a full axle to allow complete and smooth rotation next there was the eventual attachment of what is called a flywheel which would assist in maintaining momentum for another example of the flywheel let's make a tool I'll be needing in the rest of the builds a pump drill but first today's video is check it out at the great courses plus com / HTM e previously Annalise made a basic bow drill for fire-starting which could also be used to bore holes for a slightly more powerful version of construct one they utilizes a flywheel [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so with the addition of one of the utilizations of the wheel while a flywheel which by adding the ceramic disc and attaching it to the spindle it acts as extra weight that'll capture rotational inertia allowing her to continue spinning that allows it to wrap back up the other direction and then you can kind of cycle back and forth so this should make this a little bit more efficient than the bow drill a little bit faster to use and the flywheel was previously used actually with the drop spindle that Annelise made before to help her with the twine this will make a lot easier to drill holes to the concept of flywheel something that'll be useful for a lot of other things including the potter's wheel vote I'll be making next now with a push drill I could add it to my assortment of other Bronze Age tools I previously casted made before the assortment of axes chisels now a rated digger and Hammer I also finally had some success at casting a full-sized sod now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] with all my tools now to make my own wheel the potter's wheel was one of the first examples of industrialization in human history as its invention greatly increased the ability to produce pottery the importance of this tool becomes much more apparent to me since we did the reset as I've quickly realised ceramics is very versatile and one of the few materials that have been mastered at this time period where we're still before the invention of glass steel and the widespread use of many other metals for my design I'm gonna pull for me slightly more modern style a Japanese kick wheel which I previously used before and one of the first videos we made I'm making a ceramic bottle one of my patreon supporters Dax has previously built his own Rome we have a great guide to help me build my own the design is fairly simple the wheel head is attached to a flywheel with the use of tie rods and then the whole wheel sits on a mounted rod with a round rock between them acting as a bearing so first to get started I'll need to collect some wood several small and straight trees for the tie rods in a large log for a wheel head and flywheel [Music] [Music] my initial instinct was to use a slice from the log for the wheel head has it already be a circle whoever attacks has directions pointed out that the Rings are likely to break and read much better to use a cross grain wood so I'll need to hew my log and just some flat boards all right so it kind of roughly went through and hewed this log on the two sides so you get somewhat flat I wanted to do that mostly to reveal what was on the inside and see what I wanted to use it's got a fair amount of rock to it actually it's kind of a risky take when you just grab a dead tree from woods it just made a little bit easier to do the hewing since we concentrated mostly around here actually got some nice ball team patterns which would work it's actually seek out but I think it's still salvageable some parts are softer than others this area seems to be where most abroad is where this knot is I also want to avoid just cuz it's really hard to cut so there's wires right here we can use that for the top of the wheel and then I'm gonna use these two pieces here cut into two put them side-by-side to make a wheel on the bottom and yeah [Music] boom one pizza perfect actually [Music] now for the tie rods they'll connect the wheel head and the fly wheels together [Music] but they're right [Music] [Music] nevermind it's not the right side that way [Music] [Music] it's not quite a little bit there we go let's get that height glue in there [Music] [Music] [Music] oh look a snack for later but then the glue holding my boards together broke so I'll have to reglue that again later but for now this might actually make cutting the inner hole a little bit easier [Music] too bad the mounted rod I need a strong and super straight pole for it the best option I could find was actually what used to be your Christmas tree which I previously cut down for our Sigma celebration [Music] slipped up [Music] [Music] maybe the easiest way to mount the rod is you bury it deep in the ground so that offers a secure and solid base alright so we weren't able to actually bury it landlord wasn't too fond of us digging a bunch of deep holes so we're gonna do a kind of a modern assistance with the mounting and use a little bit of imagination to make this work and now this is the mounted rod that the whole thing will sit upon and in between I got a round River Rock they lacks a ball bearing so I'm gonna grease that up so that some of the olive oil we previously pressed and he's a little bit can't get the sink spinning [Music] [Music] there's a little bit of wobble as a whole and the flywheels a little too big so you try wrapping that area of the post with some twine to picking it up the bounces around less all right so sons will be working with wet clay on would put a little bit of waterproofing by applying a layer wax on the surface [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] rope is usually wrapped around the tie rods so there's no risk of your foot accidentally getting caught in the spinning wheel [Music] and something looks like it actually works feel that make a little pot here it spins I think those those are the benchmarks of success for this project it's a bit of wobble but it I'm actually surprised how well it does work it actually spins pretty well they also talked about adding cob to the flywheel to add extra weight and that would help it's been a little bit more as it is right now it's actually pretty good there's really important invention in the history of humanity kind of tell why it took a while to do it they suspect it took so long because they needed metal tools and mastery of carpentry various tools that I used were somewhat effective a lot of work effective we didn't have an ideal starting Wood was definitely a challenge we had to find a deadlock that was a little bit rotten full of maggots apparently made things a little bit harder and using some dull Bronze Age tools milling of this to get squarish was really challenging trying to do anything with actual precision refusing such imprecise tools is really hard have some definite room for improvement at wobbles the circles are definitely not perfect but technologies I developed out of the wheel are ones that will help improve this I mean just the fact that I can spin it now means I can almost use it as a lathe itself and I was invented pretty shortly after the wheel and that could help with the the mounting pole and the other poles to actually get them perfectly syndrich low even with a little bit of wobble a little eccentricity to the actual shape so it's pretty effective I mean the real challenge now is the extra pottery skills which I don't have the only pottery I've really done before this five years ago into episode I'm making an 8 ceramic bottle and we went up to st. John and learned from a professional Potter he ended up doing most of the work you kind of just held my hands literally as I did it I'm through some of our old footage and we put in our secondary channel so you want to see a little bit better of a look at how much he ended up helping me how much actually did myself he check that out on a secondary Channel we're going through some of our old content and new content and pulling some of the extra stuff that kind of didn't quite make the cut so in the end this took about 37 hours to actually complete you probably use a few more hours of refinement and everything we're gonna take many more hours in that types of learn how to use it probably ongoing learning process it didn't manage to make a little pot I feel pretty proud about but 37 hours today's a minimal age that means it's about a $300 pottery wheel its own except we're gonna do some spicy chicken wings and try and cook them up using the available technology of the Bronze Age after that our next major milestone is going to be written language which was invented shortly after the wheel itself they're gonna try and embed my own language thank you to all of our supporters on patreon I'm going to try and make you up some custom pieces for all of our $75 plus patrons thanks for watching and thanks for support you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe and check out other content we have covering a wide variety of topics also if you enjoyed these series consider supporting us on patreon we are largely a fan funded channel and depend on the support of our viewers in order to keep our series going thanks for watching
