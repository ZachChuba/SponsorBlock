description below and use the promo code what if after twenty two hundred and fifty medical trials involving three hundred and eighty thousand patient volunteers your wishes and your prayers have finally been answered we found a cure for cancer what if that were true how would it work how many lives would we save and would there be any side effects this is what if and here's what would happen if we found a cure for cancer your body heals itself but that's not our answer that's our problem the trillions of cells that make up your body are constantly copying and dividing themselves to become new cells that will replace the old and worn-out ones but when an old cell refuses to step aside that's what we call cancer it can take many forms but at the center of it all is a bad cell that doesn't go away when it's supposed to and then it divides and conquers in 1971 US President Richard Nixon declared war on cancer today were on the brink of bringing it to an end more than 250 years of cancer research so far has led to significant advances in cancer patients quality of life and life expectancy we've reached a point where some of the most commonly diagnosed cancers have a survival rate of over 90% after five years nonetheless cancer remains the second leading cause of death around the world it's time for a cure in 2019 an Israeli biotech company declared that it had a cure which it described as a cancer antibiotic the company developed a molecular toxin that could connect to a series of cancer cells and destroy them all in just one treatment of course this claim raised many eyebrows first of all because it's hard to differentiate good cells from bad ones there's a risk of hitting the wrong target but more importantly this cure hasn't been tested on humans luckily that's only one potential cure among several ideas that are being tested another treatment might include self-regulating nanoparticles that are designed to kill cancer cells meanwhile scientists are also working on ways to stop nutrients from feeding and growing a malignant tumor whichever method might actually be able to cure cancer it still doesn't mean we'll eradicate it after all it's just a cure it's not a vaccine which means new cases of cancer will still occur knowing there's a cure some people might decide to live more dangerously they might not be as inclined to quit smoking or to eat healthier unless they couldn't afford to continue their bad habits the US has the best cancer survival rates in the world thanks to sophisticated medication and technology but all that comes at very high prices often costing hundreds of thousands of dollars if a company did develop a successful cancer cure we can almost guarantee that it wouldn't be cheap the economic impacts of this discovery would affect pharmaceutical companies around the world as well as people in about 70 different medical professions people in developing countries might not even have access to the cancer cure meaning that their lives would barely be affected by this breakthrough at least not immediately while a cure for cancer might begin as costly and exclusive it would still be among the biggest milestones in medical history and we could probably employ the same research techniques or technology to fight other challenging diseases so if you're a doctor or a scientist who is watching this right now get back to working on that cure but when it's time for a break or a little inspiration we'll be waiting for you right here with another what-if
