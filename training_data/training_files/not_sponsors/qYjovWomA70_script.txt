[Applause] captain midnight [Applause] this video is brought to you by squarespace so i want to start by saying that i went into vox's video why the marvel cinematic universe feels so empty with an open mind i think there's plenty of things the mcu could have done better through the years and i think vox is generally pretty thoughtful and into video essays in fact their video on lettering and comics is something that i've gone back to over and over again it's well researched has way better editing than i could ever hope to pull off and is just an all-around great video this one though well i mean at least it's also well edited look i found this video pretty baffling it gestures at some legitimate criticisms of the mcu as a whole and i'll be sure to point out when i think it makes something that kind of approaches a good point but overall it's a really weird mess that conflates a lot of marvel history in a really strange way that while maybe not being wrong exactly is at least really misleading and if this response video seems kind of disjointed and all over the place it's because the video i'm responding to definitely is jumping wildly between old time radio golden age comics the mcu and frasier with only the thinnest of connections before i start to respond though i really encourage you to check out the video for yourself i've put a link to it down below so you can judge for yourself if i'm being fair so alright with that being said let's get into it you've got me all right got me in perfect position [Music] so after the host phil edwards introduction he immediately says something very suspect in my mind go back to 1939 and you'll find the likely birth of the marvel universe it's in marvel mystery comics number seven these characters aren't that well known today but here betty tells namor that the human torch exists this is a weird one because he's right in a way this is the first time that two characters who would later go on to be in the marvel universe crossed over with each other but calling this the likely birth of the marvel universe seems kinda like a stretch at best and sort of flat out wrong at worst first of all the company wasn't even called marvel comics yet this was back in its days as timely this isn't really what we think of as the marvel universe he goes on to compare this crossovers to others of the same kinds kind of going on at the same general time frame using the example of the green hornet and the lone ranger crossing over on the radio in the 1940s and the universal monster movies crossing over with abbott and costello and i think that's a totally fair comparison i can see the similarities but then the video pulls what i think is a bit of a sleight of hand the time spider-man got his comic in 1963 he was spending time with the fantastic four and promoting guest appearances from the hulk and this was also when the marvel universe's problems started did you catch what they just did here he conflated spider-man and the fantastic four crossing over as the exact same thing as neymar and the original human torch 20 years earlier treating it as though they were basically the same thing and stan lee and company were just continuing the universe set out by those late 30s comics and i'm sorry but that's just really not true first of all it completely devalues comic greats like jack kirby and steve ditko who helped pioneer the marvel universe as we know it today and who aren't even mentioned in this video the marvel universe that kirby and lee started in fantastic four was completely unprecedented in comics at the time vox treats it as exactly the same thing as superman and batman meeting but in my opinion that's kind of misleading first of all marvel hadn't kept publishing superhero comics for most of the 1950s they were focused on things like western and romance comics in the post-world war ii landscape most superhero books had died off except for the biggest name which incidentally weren't at marvel what lee and kirby did in the fantastic four is what most people would call the true birth of the marvel universe creating a living breathing universe whose crossovers were very different than that of just a small appearance by a fellow hero or two it carved out an entirely distinct world one where the problems the fantastic four faced in wakanda could spill over into iron man and spider-man's new york and vice versa and even though older characters like namor the original human torch and captain america were eventually worked into the continuity of what lee kirby ditko and the rest of the 60s marvel team had built make no mistake what they built was very unique from what came before and lumping it in with that early timely stuff is a pretty big oversimplification in my opinion anyway now let's talk about snow globes and don't say you're my partner i lost my partner bucky died because of me that's why i won't have another partner so the vox video takes a very sudden turn out of nowhere and pretty soon we're talking about the tommy westfall universe fan theory if you don't know basically the 80s tv medical drama saying elsewhere has a famous ending where it's implied that the entire show takes place inside a snow globe in the mind of an autistic child and since saint elsewhere crossed over with a few other shows and those shows crossed over with even more shows pretty soon you have this really fun fan theory that says everything from arrested development to the wire to i love lucy completely exist inside the mind of this boy insane elsewhere what does this have to do with the mcu well nothing really but okay let's be charitable to the video and try to explain what they're getting at here the video goes on to say again with that editing that i'm so jealous of that the crossovers between these shows were more for business purposes than any artistic reason we don't want frasier to exist in the same universe as the x-files so why would we want iron man and black panther to except um okay this is where the video gets kind of peak goofiness to me frasier and the x-files are great and yeah i agree with vox that i don't need them existing in the same universe they also occupy radically different genres the sitcom and the supernatural mystery so it makes sense that they would never have a reason to meet iron man black panther captain america spider-man i mean it almost seems goofy to state the obvious here but they're all superheroes occupying a genre that yeah has some variation like you'd expect a spider-man story to have differences in tone from a thor story but they're still in the same vein that superhero action genre i think it's really obvious why this is nothing like i love lucy and the wire being tossed into the same universe but i take their complaint about artistic compromises needing to be made in order to maintain a shared universe a little more seriously i think they really almost have a good point here if i was them and i was trying to prove their problem with marvel's interconnected nature i would have pointed straight to the big crossover events through the years that forced writers and artists to grind the stories they want to tell to a halt in order to accommodate these larger narratives which have really been delivering diminishing returns lately now that's a criticism of the way marvel works that i could get behind but they don't do that instead they compare the marvel universe to the forced and hacky crossover of happy days and morgan mindy in the 70s and look as anyone watching my channel probably knows there's a massive and obvious difference between a one-off sitcom crossover and comics where everything is attempting to exist in the same universe these two things are clearly not the same thing and it's also worth noting that unlike most of these shows fantastic four and the x-men just to name a few were created by the same core group of people now of course thousands have added to it through the years but acting as though mr fantastic talking to professor x is just as contrived and forced as like alf talking to the cast of law and order is really goofy and disingenuous it completely erases the authorship of stan lee jack kirby and others who definitely intended it to be this way oh and by the way i'm over 1300 words into this response and have you noticed that i've barely touched on the marvel cinematic universe once weirdly it takes up surprisingly little time in vox's actual video i think because it's easier for them to poke holes in the much messier more expansive universe of the comics but here they are finally ready to get into it try on the rocket quickly correction i'll launch my own rocket so now we get to the real meat of the argument here the mcu requires scenes like this one that phil points out in ant-man where the characters give kind of a strained excuse for why the rest of the avengers can't be in the story and he's not wrong a lot of mcu movies have scenes like this and sometimes they can feel clunky and forced but then he says these heavy-handed editions are about getting crossover hype not about telling a good story and i think that's kind of a reach i'll be honest i'm not the biggest fan of this movie but this scene is in the film to maintain the reality of the universe that the mcu has built if i lived in the same universe as the avengers and i had a huge problem i'd probably want to take that problem to them too so it makes sense that scott would do the same it helps the mcu have internal logic and feel like a real place so i think vox is being a little unfair here then the video really loses me with its next point it points to spider-man homecoming as a good example of how to use the mcu but for all the wrong reasons it's cool when peter parker's classroom has a picture of bruce banner in the corner but it's not a transformed universe it's like quentin tarantino including the imaginary brand of red apple cigarettes in multiple movies it's cool it's not a coherent intertwined world he's saying it's good because the references to the rest of the mcu are more small easter eggs than anything else and i like those small touches too but it ignores one huge thing the entire story of homecoming the reason spidey is facing off against the vulture at all is completely built off the foundation of the mcu movies that came before it adrian toombs is angry because he feels like tony stark's company has screwed him over on the cleanup of new york after the avengers his legal business is entirely built on selling jitari technology left behind from that battle literally the villain's motivations only exist because of the events of earlier movies vox is trying to play it off like homecoming's references to the rest of the mcu are only skin deep when if anything homecoming is more indebted to the existing continuity of the mcu than the vast majority of marvel movies it just uses that in a smarter and more thoughtful way than older entries like ant-man another mcu movie that vox conveniently doesn't mention at all is thor ragnarok i mean come on this thing is a pretty direct crossover the hulk and thor teaming up does it feel like there are happy days in mork and mindy example from earlier where the two are shoved together for purely commercial reasons with no artistic merit to be found i'm guessing vox didn't want to have to make that argument because most people kind of agree that ragnarok was a really fun creative movie that used the pairing between thor and bruce banner really well when you look at that movie it's really hard to take their comparison to the tommy westfall fan theory universe seriously anyway then vox moves on to a point that made their comment section very angry add aquaman to that poster if you didn't know dc owned him would anyone notice the mcu has no rules beyond corporate ownership it's a superhero hodgepodge i get his point it is weird that iron man and doctor strange exist in the same world but i think he's kind of missing the appeal of that structure the marvel universe is a lot like our own except more fantastical in every way one of the elements that i think attracts people to the interconnected universe concept is that in marvel comics it doesn't matter if you're an average teen a genius inventor a norse god whatever there's always something weird and outside the boundaries of reality around every corner every legend you grew up with every monster you're scared of and every power you can imagine they're all there existing together at once playing off each other having their own stories that could play out among the stars or on a regular street not that different from yours or mine so yeah vox is right the marvel universe could easily fit a guy from atlantis into things in fact in fact they already have one that phil mentioned earlier but in my mind that's not a weakness that's a strength and it's why this fictional universe flaws in all has engaged people's imagination for decades now [Music] it's working it's just like water skiing on dry land next up vox positively cites the fox x-men universe as a better way to build an interconnected universe and look i like a lot of those movies and i'm not even the type that gets really hung up over how weird and nonsense the timeline for that series is i think phil has one decent point here too that the brand management of disney probably wouldn't let something like logan get made but and even tonal experimentation with deep integration to the x-men mythology come on that's a bit of a stretch no x-men movie has ever integrated its universe as elegantly as like homecoming did in the mcu to cite an example from earlier and i think even fox's willingness to change tones is kind of overstated logan and deadpool and maybe first class notwithstanding the vast majority of fox x-men movies have this kind of similar blandish bryan singer visual style and tone now don't get me wrong i like x2 as much as the next guy but come on acting like the fox movies are some sort of bastion of experimentation is just wrong there's a sameness to a lot of those films that vox is accusing the mcu of and to be fair to vox their criticisms of netflix's take on the mcu is pretty correct i've been a little let down by how many of those shows pay lip service to the events of the movie without often examining the actual effect that the events of those movies would have on the people of new york but citing the x-men movies as a more thoughtful counter-example yeah sorry i'm just not buying it and lastly this but right now would anybody be surprised if disney forced a marvel star wars crossover um yeah phil i mean i would through the course of this video vox throws a lot at the viewers radio dramas fan theories the x-men the fawns but what does it all add up to i think a pretty simple message crossovers are outlandish and artistically bankrupt that's an opinion you're free to agree with or disagree with but to pretend that the universe kirby ditko lee and so many others created is comparable to the shallow crossovers of a few 70 sitcoms seems a little ridiculous to me you know one of the things that i've always engaged with most in the marvel universe is the total sense of possibility there's always something new out there to discover offer code captainmidnight here's a special tip for the fellas and girls who have not already joined captain midnight's new 1940
