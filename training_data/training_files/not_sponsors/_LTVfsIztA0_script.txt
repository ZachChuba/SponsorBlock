price drop or a coupon code more on this later [Applause] what's up guys salut welcome back to the fried rice series where i'm trying to perfect the ultimate ciao fan at a restaurant level for that in the previous episode i bought a super professional laden but i also bought this beautiful authentic cantonese wok i also built this stir-frying practice rig for me to just be able to try unfortunately none of this is worth anything if i don't build a solid primer a theory so here it is oops now when it comes to learning new skills new culinary skills youtube is my go-to okay like for example when i learn how to wrap up the world's best omelette by chef and legend jacques pippen [Music] i love a little drama when i did that i used a youtube video so my guts right now are telling me to look for a chinese stir-frying tutorial on youtube [Music] the situation here is a little different and a little more complicated you see i've got two main obstacles on my row first of all authentic chinese cooking is not that common on youtube westernized chinese food you can find this everywhere but authentic nah second obstacle there are a few channels who do authentic chinese cooking but they usually focus on home cooking recipes i'm looking for restaurant technique tutorial it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack right here now i may possibly be the luckiest on earth because i've managed to find one stir-frying tutorial on youtube it has english subtitles hosted by a super legend made chef chef wang he uses a cantonese walk over a restaurant stove now as much as i enjoy this video i'm basically looking for more details for example how should i position my fingers how should i place my body how much force should i apply also about the motion it would be so useful to see things being actually tossed in the walk and i'm missing all these little details it's gonna be complicated to make progress but remember this is not my comfort zone this is not an omelette video of me i need more perspectives on the subject we are talking about china the most populated country on the planet so very likely the country with the greatest populations of chef there should be hundreds of tutorials like this one on youtube on youtube on youtube on youtube youtube is completely blocked in china you can't access them in china youtube block in china on youtube extension thank you karma for sponsoring this video on youtube [Music] i need to find the chinese equivalent of youtube translate it to english tried a few research in english [Music] oh no fair enough i guess i just have to learn how to speak chinese then means [Music] ah well there clearly the problem with this app [Applause] so instead i decided to start with english term get them translated and then use this output ah in all fairness it worked so-so i guess the closest i've found to start frying tutorial is this video i copied the chinese characters and reverse translated the chef turns the pot with great momentum the roar of the fierce stir-fry the action is chic and i love it somewhere in this sentence lies the key to unlocking this mystery stir-fry didn't work out before so i love it not right action is chic undecided turn the pot um [Music] that's what i'm talking about hundreds of tutorials on the subject well i guess the only thing left for me now is just to uh watch them [Music] after having spent hours and i was searching i have found three hidden gems let me introduce you to number one chong yuan meishi as known as the gourmet champion i call this guy the boxing champion you'll understand why in a second rarely seen a kitchen the two handles should not be at the same height the furthest away from you should always be slightly below the other one and also this guy is all about building some muscle memory that's why he is my boxing champion because he's always practicing two hands one hand the other one so basically i should start practicing with two hands first like this down up pull down and pull and i should try to feel the weight of the walk the momentum the inertia it's almost like this hand is moving in a circle and then allegedly once you feel comfortable with two hands and that you have a very symmetrical movement you should be able to switch to one hand and keep the walk in a straight line which i'm failing at at the moment this guy also explained how to hold the ladder with the index pointing forward [Music] i love this guy if the first video was all about the move the momentum the rhythm this video is more about your interaction with the walk through the handle first of all i need to use a towel for this like a small spongy towel every chef has a specific and personal way to fold that towel but in the end it should always end up being very thick and have some sort of a spring-loaded action to it the cloth must be sparkingly clean it's more than just a tool it's also like your reputation as a chef i like when people just share a little more than just what is obvious so why do i call him el professor being talented is one thing but being a great teacher is another thing he's calm he explains things in a very clear way and yet he remain very casual in his own speech i shouldn't be holding the work handle in the center i should be holding it on the side what he called the triangle the thumb needs power to resist the handle while the index finger will be used to put some leverage into this i'm gonna have to use all the other fingers as a support underneath and this way i should be able to lift that up looks simple but i'm shaking like crazy looks like so that's for number two now let's talk about treasure number three the hau meishi gongzo shoe but i call this guy poke face [Music] this guy is just like on another level the stance the balance the core strength this guy has out of this world so what i have understand the most about this video is the importance of the stance of the balance of how you distribute your whole weight how you position yourself compared to the wall that's impossible it says i should be holding the wok with the ladder with two pounds of rice from one minute i just want to see where i stand in all this three two one sorry man the pain in my wrist and in my thumb i'm definitely not pokey look at this this is the poker face i told you about this is him having the best time of his life and here it's him in atrocious pain what can you read on his face nothing i should position myself slightly on the side in order to have a bit more room for this arm to move more freely i should stand about 10 centimeters from the walk be straight have a poker face which is going to be hard for me the shoulder should lead the elbow the elbow should lead the wrist i love this even though for me at this moment it makes no sense i'm making micro steps at the moment i'm so happy i'm so glad i'm so relieved almost that i didn't let the language barrier stop me because i'm french in the first place i don't speak like this so i can't see why language should be any barrier for me it shouldn't be otherwise i would never have discovered these immensely talented individuals it really is a small world after all i need now to to put in some dedication and some perseverance and i need not to give up halfway obviously easier said than done this is it guys this is i i have no excuse left no more i've got the gear i've got the walk i've got the ladle i've got the practice rig and i've got the knowledge i know how i should be moving the walk i know how i should be gripping the walk and i know finally how i should be standing how i should balance my weight and my strength with it now obviously the only thing left is just to practice practice practice and that is exactly what i intend to do in the next episode so in the meantime you take care [Music] bye-bye [Music] so
