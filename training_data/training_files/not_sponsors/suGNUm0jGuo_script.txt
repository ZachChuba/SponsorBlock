the shape of humanity's past present and future is intertwined with nature our lives are directly shaped by the animal world and vice versa many thousands of years ago our prehistoric ancestors we're forced to protect themselves against the larger animal [Music] bees impact our food production bats control insect populations and without baby monkey going backwards on a pig I don't know where we'd be as a civilization [Music] yet it is a special relationship with a few key species that really allowed our species to take off this is domestication probably food was one of the first uses to which animals work foot [Music] I'm just heating Amir Wiseman animal logic second nature before we get into and now back to the show domestication is the process in which humans change a wild species by selectively breeding favorable traits it's how we go from a hulking wolf to a chatter in Chihuahua be careful a fella if you don't fold in those ears you're gonna take off in the breeze by selecting which specific animals can procreate you can fine tune different breeds to look or behave a certain way have a rat problem breed dogs that are primitive adding eat a helping hand with your livestock breed dogs that have strong predatory instincts but don't treat catalyst prey need a cute gift for your kids breed dogs with shorter fatter and uglier faces domestication obviously is an all dog but they do exemplify the extreme range of development that can be accomplished via domestication which can oftentimes be unethical [Music] greyhounds have been bred for speed Alaskan Huskies have the job of hauling heavily loaded sleds the wire-haired pups terrier are quick as a flash on the getaway the collies good temper and disposition together with his size and strength make him one of the best of all watch dogs for safety domestication has had an irreversible effect not only on the species we domesticated but on ourselves as well the rise of domestication through the world saw a marked shift in human culture in society we moved away from hunter-gatherer & nomadic lifestyles and instead became herders and farmers before domestication hunter-gatherer peoples depended on species that were abundant in their territory in Europe they ate a lot of red deer in the Middle East and Asia they eat gazelle in North America they ate bison and in sub-saharan Africa where species were more diverse and abundant they ate a wider range of prey despite their popularity none of these species were successfully domesticated of all the millions of species on earth we have only been able to domesticate a handful this is because there are six characteristics that an animal must have in order to be successfully domesticated one their food must be cheap plentiful and ideally something we don't eat this is why herbivores are far and away the most successful domesticated species while not many carnivorous species have been domesticated - they need to grow fast domestication is a game of inputs and outputs an animal that eats a lot but doesn't give much meat milk or eggs isn't a useful animal 3 they have to be able to reliably breed in captivity this rules out a lot of species or they have to be calm and passive enough that we're not fearful for our lives around them 5 they have to be comfortable enough around humans that their fight-or-flight instinct doesn't kick in in stressful situations and 6 they have to be social solitary species are much less likely to accept humans as part of their group these six characteristics narrow down the millions of species on the planet to about 50 s that we've been able to domesticate everyone who has and loves a dog thinks that his dog is the best dogs are not only our best friends but our oldest friends they were the first species that we domesticated the ancestors of dogs diverged from gray wolves between 20 and 40 thousand years ago and we first domesticated them between ten and fifteen thousand years ago waltz made great candidates for domestication because the hierarchical structure of their pack mirrors human societies quite well wolf packs have dominant members and subservient members and so what dominant human could fit into the social order quite well becoming the packs alpha member over time the aggressive dogs would be kicked out of our packs and the helpful and more subservient ones would be kept and allowed to breed and soon they were domesticated developing floppy ears and curly tails as domestication syndrome kicked in come on go away domestication syndrome is an interesting consequence of domestication in most domesticated animals the species will see a shift in appearance as well as behavior this includes things like having shorter faces smaller teeth smaller brains color changes changes to ear and tail shape and more frequent breeding cycles cats are one of our oldest companions although we never really domesticated them they domesticated themselves well here is mother cat at the kitchen door I suppose that you are still hungry cats have been found in human grave sites as old as 10,000 years stone-age cats have even been found in areas to which they are not native like Cypress meaning that we brought them there the variety of wild cat from the Middle East feel as Silvestre sly becca is thought to be the origin of all domestic cats the main reason that cats began to hang around with us lowly humans was agriculture as we started farming our grain-rich Lin began to track ting rodents the wild cats were then attracted to the rodents thinking I can haz rodent and like dogs followed the commensal path towards domestication they realized that they could get more food by sticking with us and we found that we could get help from them killing rodents controlling pests and eventually getting us fake internet points with dank memes while dogs were selectively bred to be different shapes and sizes to accomplish particular tasks like riding herding and hunting cats weren't the cats that could tolerate human environments basically selected themselves to be the ones we kept they allowed us to keep them around the species which man has domesticated is shown by this small cube most of these were domesticated by man before history began sheep and goats for the first livestock to be successfully domesticated this happened around ten thousand five hundred years ago followed by cattle and pigs about five hundred years later in South America about 8,000 years ago they had a much smaller and a much cuter domesticated food source in the mountains people domesticated a small fat and apparently delicious rodent called the guinea pig they were domesticated so well but they are both an excellent food source and greatest pets around the same time in China a large group of farmers were able to turn mallards into domesticated ducks but it would be in South Asia where the king of domesticated poultry would arise the red jungle fowl is a species of bird that was domesticated simultaneously in different areas of Asia and by 1,000 BCE they had spread across Europe and Africa the chicken chickens are specialists in meat production here is one dressed and ready for cooking these birds were so successful because they could survive from their own foraging chickens have no peace so they swallow their food whole and supplied humans with both meat and eggs they could also lay eggs very frequently and those chickens that laid eggs the most often were selectively bred for that characteristic [Music] domestication altered the course of human civilization and there was no species that was more important to us than the horse horses have carried us through war peace feast and famine while they have been used for food it's as transport where they really hit their stride and until the Train was invented the fastest way to traverse land was on horseback it was from a saddle that human civilization became globalized horses were used to transport the product of another domesticated species but this one isn't a mammal the silk moth caterpillar these larval moths have been domesticated for at least 5,000 years and reused to fuel China silk industry [Music] unlike domesticated bees which aren't terribly different from wild bees silk moth caterpillars have some striking differences from their wild counterparts first of all they are bred to be silk producing machines domesticated silk moth caterpillars produced ten times more silk than wild ones they also grow much faster require less food are less stressed by humans and are more comfortable in cramped spaces they have been purpose bred to be beneficial to us as spinning begins he expels fluid from each of his small glands to a tongue like depositor on his upper lip this fluid upon contact with the air forms a single filament or a strand of silk unfortunately like with a lot of domesticated species it's come at a cost adult domesticated silk moths have lost their coloration and they are completely unable to fly for every domesticated species there are thousands in which domestication didn't take zebras are a good example of this while they may appear very similar to horses they have one key difference that makes them untenable for domestication they are adapted for life in highly dangerous habitats they live in sub-saharan Africa a biome filled with large predators always on the lookout for large prey and so the zebra has always been much too skittish for domestication to work easily the most disappointingly undomesticated species is the moose many people have attempted to domesticate moose over the years including king carl xi of sweden and stalin in an attempt to establish a moose cavalry but unfortunately for badassery everywhere they have always failed this is because moose don't fit the six requirements for domestication like other deer moose don't like being approached their huge size makes them hard to handle and dangerous to interact with they are incredibly aggressive during rutting season and finally at the slightest hint of danger they are uncontrollably panicky which is too bad because riding a moose just might be the most intimidating thing you can do if we take our Mounties to the next level fortunately there is at least one badass instance of moose riding even if it is photoshopped though there is one species that is flaunting the rules of domestication the Fox rule number six is that the species have to be social but foxes aren't but a lab in Novosibirsk Russia for the past 60 years has been breeding red and silver foxes selecting for friendliness and slowly the foxes have started showing domestication syndrome and are definitely friendlier than their wild counterparts it is estimated that today nearly four-fifths of the people of the earth as shown by the dark portions of the continents still depend upon the power of animals so what should we talk about next as always don't forget to let us know in the comments and please subscribe for new episodes of Animal Logic second-nature every other week thanks for watching I'll figure it Donn's and wolves make great candidates for domestication because the hierarchical structure of their society mirrors our what mirrors ours ours mirror mirrors ours try saying that that's hard mirrors our I can't say without a weird leg like accent back in my neck here like a town crier
