the noida feast update recently released adding a large amount of new content probably the most major change is the introduction of a new eating and drinking system most powders and liquids can be ingested resulting in a variety of different effects both good and bad also ingesting too much now results in rapid so to celebrate this feast we're going to eat and drink everything well everything obtainable that can be ingested anyway to help with this I'm gonna use the cheat UE mod so that I don't have to hunt down all of these substances over the course of days or weeks for the more rare of the substances anyway it's gonna be quite a large feast so let's begin speaking of rare substances we're gonna get started with this one right here a urine jar which has a one percent chance of spawning in the mine's seed number one four four one seven zero six six seven three has one of these down and to the left of the entrance to the mines thank very much to user block gun from reddit for supplying me with this seed anyway now let's take a taste or two or three okay so it makes me sick food poisoning you're feeling sick nothing stays inside ingesting urine yeah but it's sterile and I like the taste also right now might find a flask of this around Seema which is a seasonal event happening in Noida probably around the end of April the beginning of May to celebrate the Finnish holiday of that both which takes place on May 1st and Seema is a very lightly alcoholic drink so even drinking an entire flask of it only makes drunk for like seven seconds anyway now we're really gonna get started we got acid and then whisky and then blood and then fungus blood so starting with acid once it makes us poisoned for 30 seconds a poisoning slowly degrades your health at 100 max HP we take two per second leaving us with an HP of 60 boom all right now whiskey if we take one sip of whiskey we get drunk for 30 seconds drink too much aiming is disturbed okay but what if we drink an entire flask of whiskey oh boy it poisons us for 235 seconds oh my god 240 seconds drunk we're wasted actually the poisoning went away drank too much aiming is disturbed drinking more will make poisoned okay well and we see double obviously and we're throwing off all over the place drinking a flask of blood is not too interesting on its own but with the vampirism perk it makes for a pretty handy healing potion the results of drinking fungus blood are the same as eating solid fungus it uh makes a little bit in harmony with the magic but what if we drink the whole thing oh boy 480 490 seconds almost of yeah all right now for worm blood which obviously if we drink the whole flask gives us 500 seconds of wormy vision you're seeing things more clearly which allows to see the entire screen without the all-seeing eye perk and it also allows to see in the dark drinking cement does nothing it just makes full get out of here drinking lava you're burning inside or it was like eight seconds I'll get out of here drinking liquid fire or just a fire flask your insides are burning for nine seconds drinking berserk gives 15 seconds of berserk per set drinking pheromone gives 20 seconds of charmed purse if drinking healthy 'm gives 7 seconds of regeneration very very useful lively concoction now 7 seconds of regeneration same thing okay one sip of invisibly 'm makes sick for 20 seconds one sip of concentrated mana gives 20 seconds of mana regen let's put accelerate a.m. to a little bit of a test right now as we find some different scenery so drinking accelerate a.m. 20 seconds greased lightning however staining yourself with it seems to last much longer however if are in a hurry and you're afraid of the stain washing off then drinking it is pretty handy for just a quick 20 second burst of speed picking a single sip of regular polymorph een polymorphs into a sheep for about 10 seconds taking one sip of chaotic poly morphine polymorphs into anything at all or again about 10 seconds taking one sip of teleport adium teleports in the direction of your cursor one single time now ambrosia is a pretty interesting one if we try to drink it it just makes us sick so no more swimming in lava or acid which makes me a little bit sad but it's fine the interesting thing is as we all know if we stain ourselves with it then it protects from all damage or however long have the same on including the damage that happens when explode from overeating and over drinking meaning can potentially use this as a means of attack perhaps now for some worm pheromone one set 40 seconds of worm food do feel like your future worm food flux iam one sip gives us 10 seconds of confused feel confused alchemic precursor one sip ten seconds of poisoned and 10 seconds of food poisoning and draught of midas one sip gives us another 10 seconds of poisoned and 10 seconds of food poisoning interesting now for oil one set five seconds of poisoned and 20 seconds of food poisoning toxic sludge once a 10 seconds of poisoned poison one set 12 seconds of poisoned imagine that not quite unobtainable but pretty rare piece suit one sip of pea soup gives 30 seconds of gassy you're feeling pressure inside oh nice lamb Abul gasps next slime 20 seconds of food poisoning slush nothing just like drinking water just fill up your stomach swamp which is the greenish liquid that forms on top of water in the fungal cavern and jungle five seconds of food poisoning void liquid absolutely nothing it would be cool actually avoid liquid emptied your stomach instead of filling up your stomach and now for vomit food poisoning 10 seconds brine nothing just fullness burning powder nothing just fullness evergreen seed flasks nothing just fullness gunpowder nothing purifying powder nothing solved nothing sodium nothing next freezing liquid flask Oh gives us 20 seconds of chilly you're feeling cold inside movement is difficult meat this fullness green slimy meat ooh that gets us set worm eat and eat it really nothing and rotten meat that gets a sick and poisons us grass gives us gas snow makes us slow cheese yes please we could literally eat our way into the moon now whoops spray a little bit of Ambrosia on us though and here we go no big deal let's get ready to rumble nice alright finally let's see if creepy liquid does anything no no it just makes a little bit fuller
