Oh would you look at that today is my birthday so to celebrate here's my birthday gift to you something I should have done a while back to tell you the truth hey guys Master coax here and yes it is my birthday today but instead of having some cake or muffins and going off to party as if I'm like parties I'm here today with you to maybe go over something that I probably should have done a long time ago you see back when I did part 13 of whatever Alice turned good I plan to then cover the end of Z in some way that was more than just your typical water story and so I commissioned the artist kitty hands to make some comic images to help illustrate a particular scenario in which encompassed a particular part within the law that wasn't so easy to actually do we live in a very turbulent and uncertain time within Dragonball I mean for decades the peaceful world saga better known as the end of Z of course has been essentially the de facto conclusion of the manga based timeline of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z as written and planned by a carrot Ori Armour yes Dragon Ball GT carries a story on sort of asked us the game Dragon Ball online but h78 forest the agreed conclusion of the official timeline in terms of the manga and the anime series Dragon Ball Z but now with super and it's very very destiny looming over us this period of Z is now kind of endangered with the possibility of it being overwritten or dismissed as obsolete within the main timeline of events although the odds of this actually happening are still pretty low since we're being prepared for boobs debut and also toe is not gonna deny it exists otherwise they're gonna lose money out of it so yeah I couldn't wait any longer today I want to talk about this period of Raddatz and formally introduced adult ranch as well as explained finally as to why she has Super Saiyan 4 as some of you from the GT stories and the series of videos I've been a little puzzled as to how she got the power in the first place but screen and thank you for listening let's presume that some time has passed between the latest part of Raddatz turn good whatever it is pre GT over this time the dicta has become much less prickly since the days of part 10 where he had reached full rage mode and fought rabbits with that classic Super Saiyan 4 vs. blue duel which ended in a draw and was then the beginning of the reparations between rabbits and Vegeta their relationship by now things have cooled down a lot and the Prince is now looking for a way to redeem himself without seeming nothing like his character like he's a simpering coward kind of like a rat heads am i right he has a good idea which he pitches to the kids well I say kids they're now like in their teens and unlike the main storyline they're actually going to age up instead of being forever table-size like the original but g2 proposes that he will train the three of them together as they seem to come in a package I hate to split you up because quite clearly you can't seem to exist without each other trunks is getting very bashful and ranch is prickly up at the thought of being dependence but Goten gets what the GTR is trying to go for I mean this is go ten of course he can see the best in almost anyone guys relax the Jiva is serious he wants to help don't you miss the Vegeta first off you can drop them mr. routine it's not becoming for the principal Saiyans that being said but gia does appreciate the good word from Kakarot skit and so the jitta begins to train the three children but in his own way he will teach them the power of Super Saiyan 4 and ensure that his way of learning things will carry down to the next generation yeah he may be feeling better towards rabbits nowadays but that doesn't mean that desired to be the better fighter and being the top dog of all the Saiyans hasn't disappeared that's still there however it's becoming clear that despite his support Goten throughout all of this isn't really adjusting well to the jitta style of training not for a few weeks but jitta calls him out on it but doesn't act nastily hey goteng I think it's time you went to train with Kakarot what but mr. Vegeta I can do it I told you to drop the mr. act I can tell that you're the only training with me because your friends are the last thing I want you to be as a suck-up like Raddatz can be branch throws him an ugly look from behind go and train with your dad I can tell you would be much better suited to his training be true to yourself do what you want to do instead of doing what others want to do Goten looks a little surprised but deep down the guy is right he had been struggling with the ideas of vegeta straining and Super Saiyan form it didn't feel right to him for some reason Goten thanks for Jeter throws honesty and apologizes to Ranchin trunks for wasting their time but they both hug him and tell him it's okay they look forward to hanging out with him afterwards and seeing what yeah the results are of his training I see how it compares with that Goten heads off to train with Goku and of course sometimes Raddatz and ranch in trunks continue their progression to Super Saiyan 4 with Vegeta over the years that follow branch and trunks is relationship into a full-blown boyfriend-girlfriend affair with Vegeta's ulterior motive for training them coming to the fore become quite clear he can keep an eye on the two of them and make sure that nothing funny happens and also make sure his son behaves in a way best suited to the son of the principal Saiyans it goes to show that ultimately Vegeta does care about his kid and maybe his possible future daughter-in-law still that would mean he'd be brothers of sources of that tall o Raddatz who would you just shut us to think about but what he doesn't shudder at is the aptitude of his two students ranch and trunks are able to toughen up and when they are then exposed to the blood slave cannon to coach Super Saiyan 4 out of them they are able to transform ranch with a little more ease thanks to the fact that she had her tail already and when they gaze upon their Super Saiyan 4 forms for the first time they are amazed and also freaked out by the abundance of hair all over them oh please says unimpressed Vegeta also in the form is that your only concern give me a break Vegeta then tells them to keep this part of the training a secret he doesn't want anyone to know that these two can transform into Super Saiyan 4 just yet he wants to wait for the right moment to reveal it to really grind Raddatz as gears this time for more playful purposes rather than just for pure malice progress I guess as the kids become adults their personalities change slightly as Goten and Trunks grow up they still sort of revert to what they are like in the original timeline in the end of Z with trunks growing a little bit more reserved and respectful and Goten becoming much more confident playful loud in fact Goten is even more playful now that he's been given more opportunities to show off his own identity for once not to mention the fact that rat it's sort of encourages all of this and he's being nurtured quite well in that regard and that's ranch her mother's side has definitely given her the drive to show her strength as well as her good she has become quite assured of herself as well as tall that she got from her father she's basically shot right up to being almost as tall as rabbits about six foot tall or so towering over most of the dragon team except for her dad and piccolo of course her personality has changed a little too with age has come a more eccentric mood when not in battle she's basically acting a little more like her father in terms of being a goofball but thanks to the influence of Vegeta and launch she can be serious and gets what she wants whenever she needs to with trunks she knows how to push his buttons and get him going okay let's get to the end of Z proper World Martial Arts Tournament is upon us and by this time Pan has now become a little girl and it's taking a part in the contest with Grandpa Goku looking to maybe train her much more seriously nowadays if she does well in the tournament Raddatz has actually backed off a little in this time in the last couple of years really gelling well with all of this peacetime he still likes to Train sure but he would go and have some more fun with his sons daikon and mu Lee who are now in their teens and love spending time with their dad the three of them often go on trips around the planet having fun not having any cares despite launch wanting Raddatz to get a proper job of course when the tournament comes the boys failed to make the top 16 thanks to their unlucky matching which saw daikon being beaten by big sister Raj who were never hauled back and Murali up against pan but it's his sensitive nature that causes this he let his five-year old cousin win just to be nice we get to the top 16 which sees pan win against wild tiger like in the original Goku wins over Raddatz and Vegeta getting through as well captain chicken thankfully also gets through and there's also a couple of extra guests careful acaba and kale have come to take part as well kalila instigated this trip as she wanted to fight raunch again and beat her for the second time in a row thanks to that same pride and all and growing rivalry between them you know that stuff we talked about in part 12 they meet in a sixteen clash and cauliflower wins wait massacre doesn't watch those Super Saiyan for surely she could have won right well yes in theory she could but remember she had promised to keep this power secret the GTR told her not to reveal it yet and so she would respect that and not use it also she didn't resort to Super Saiyan 3 either as she promised herself that she would never use it again after what happened but Cleveland did and therefore she won thanks to ranch simply restricting herself as we get to the final we are then down to the GT vs. Goku with Vegeta having beaten Khalifa and Goku winning over pan not wanting to hold back but still going a little bit easy since he didn't want to upset Gohan in this final we get the ultimate battle which the crowd absolutely love it's a pretty intense tussle which sees Vegeta come out on top and win the fight because he gets to use Super Saiyan 4 and Goku doesn't have access to all - instinct so therefore his blue power could only go so far we then get to the grand final between Vegeta and mr. Saturn now like in the original there is an understanding between the Dragon team and mr. Saturn that would see him carrying on to win the tournament forever in exchange for favors or cash all until the day the chat wished to retire and pass on the crown to somebody else unfortunately for him but Jesus add no intention to follow this trend in the grand final Vegeta wins within a matter of three seconds the crowd are aghast what just happened mr. Sutton gets up and walks over to Vegeta looking furious hey what do you think you're doing huh I thought we had an agreement as if I'd agree to something so demeaning I'm actually doing you a favor pal but either then turns to face mr. Saturn who is quivering with anger if you come back and win next time people will love you even more you'll be the underdog and if you get somebody else to agree to your little understanding the crowd will Herald their saviors return to glory even more than you're just constantly winning you'll be more popular than ever mr. Saturn thinks for a moment and beams yes that's a good idea I'll do that thanks for dinner you are so smart would you take ignore the compliment and just sinks off to collect the prize money and trophy meanwhile bomber and chichi are cementing Vegeta's defiance despite the paycheck whilst launch and Raddatz are in hysterics watching mr. Saturn fall to Vegeta like that that had been the best thing that they'd seen all day and that was even after seeing a grown man in a chicken suit being tossed out of the ring by a little girl pan related to that launch congratulate span by saying oh yeah major great and stay with that one kid I salute you Goku feels that pan did very well out there also so well in fact that he offers to train pan full on from now on take it up a notch but here comes another twist panda clients Goku's offer she would much rather be trained by her cool aunt Raj ranch and trunks whip around in surprise but pan is certain in what she wants you are so cool ah there I want to be cool to watch them blushes yeah I guess I'm pretty cool trunks being the nice guy that he is box is up by saying ranches indeed pretty awesome and ranch sees through this though and knows that her boyfriend is only saying this so that he might get some later she is totally getting trunks flustered and teasing him to no end she's in total control here trunks is beat red right now and covers pans ears who is totally unaware of the situation by the way and throughout all of this Goku is a little confused and even a little sad goat and then comes over to cheer him up trying to comfort him by saying that don't worry he will train with him even more and together they could get really strong this does perk Goku up and the two of them hug it out Gohan is then worried that pan might end up bothering Raj but Raj isn't that worried she gets on well with pan and the two seem to already be clicking Khalifa asserts this - you're gonna have a blast maybe next time they come visit how far is he both and probably win again Raj doesn't take too kindly to that so to try and gain some cool points with pan she decides to show the kid secret something she wasn't supposed to share but now wants to especially if the two of them are going to be training together she wants to be honest with her potential new student naturally pan wants to know this secret as adorably as possible and with Raj being subject to her cuteness obliges showcasing the super Sam for power by powering up to it epically in a corner of the tournament grounds ront then expose its the properties of the power to pan saying that if she trains hard and once her body is fully ready for the powers of four she could have this power to some day and this just makes Pam all the more excited to practice with her pan then promises ranch that she will do her very best and not let her down now just as ranch powers back down Raddatz rounds the corner having sense this Super Saiyan for power but mistaking it for Vegeta as he has no idea about Raj having this power - she affirms his supposition and tries to brush off the comment and with that Raddatz then suggests the three of them go and get some ice cream as he's now pretty bored he also took launches word so it's free ice cream - but she then finds out and is running after them pretty angrily we part company with the group as Raddatz hurriedly grabs ranch and pan under his arms and carries them away and that's where we're going to be leaving things for the end of Z so what do you guys think does this answer some of your questions do you feel that this is a nice alternative to the original end of Z leave a comment below and let's get this discussion going and I shall see you in the next video catch you later
