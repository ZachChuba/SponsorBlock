hey guys with my japanese buckets alongside gonna set up somewhere make some noise see how we go look at this shibuya is always crazy it's summer as well which is awesome it's like it's always like a festive feeling here even though there's no festivals it's just people lots of people let's get back to shibuya and play some buckets i'm like about two blocks away from the station lots of people here i like this spot i like this spot because it's not too crazy at the station i mean if you block if you block the roads near the station because people are watching you get in trouble so i need a bigger area like this ah been a good echo lots of energy we've got the party bus going behind me the only annoying thing is is that screen behind me it can be a bit loud they are like uh they've got ads and everything running they're non-stop you can hear them now but so i gotta fight with that while i bike a drum but other than that i like this spot nice hard ground the tiled floor is good to play on as well something i do want to try with these japanese buckets is playing doubles on the bass drum part recently as you might have seen i played like single uh doubles a lot on the rim because you get more rebound there it's very easy to just blast them out but i've been working on my doubles trying to make them a bit stronger i did the whole video on it um so with these japanese buckets hopefully i hope that they have more rebound in the part with in the middle of the bucket that i use as a bass drum the other buckets i've been using there's pretty much no rebound there so you have to muscle it through every time you want to play doubles but if i can play doubles on these japanese buckets it'll be like dub like a double bass drum sound which will be cool i'm looking forward to that see how well i can blast them out it'll still be a lot more tiring than just playing them on the rim of the bucket but i'm excited if i can't play him today if i can't make him clean or really good just means i just have to practice practice them a bit more until i can get it right [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Applause] so [Applause] [Music] uh [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] so [Applause] the hard thing about like especially the summer in japan is so humid you sweat a lot so you got to get used to like sweaty hands and um and being able to control the drumstick with a sweaty hand it's hard but i'll get used to it
