good has that ever happened for my dudes has anyone ever got a third aged pickaxe with a bloodhound are you serious was it sorry what did the mimic give me then mimic gave me the third age pickaxe mimic op i got nothing from the mimic until now the milk strip just gave me a third age pickaxe that's insane crabs right you deserve it dude nah i don't but that's funny how much is this legit one dude i'm not poor anymore oh boys just just i'm shaking a little bit look at this i haven't shaped playing iris in a while oh you can't quite see it because when you when you kill the mimic you get like so much red text you get like the kill you get the extra reward and all that i didn't even see the pair i saw that pickaxe i was like no way and then the pet i was like you could imagine if i noticed both at the same time i might have just exploded we did it it's over 422 kill card after piecing out for two months we come back with the bloodhound and authority check we break this baby in look at that look at that nice crusty pickaxe beautiful talk to him come here i'm still shaking look at this you can't even see that i got it all dude i know what caused it we did it with the wrong med it was all the ruined metal lung it was always the rune med always has been yes we got the pet and third age pickaxe in the same clue slap me with the fish slap me thank you wake me up am i dreaming i did not do it i can't feel it i might be dreaming yeah legit is that the rarest drop in rs history and it happened to me i'm honored that's the rarest clue in rs history i don't know because of the mimik but maybe look at my handsome papa is that what it costs to uh ensure thank you look he looks so ugly in the future i can't like hit insure him i don't want him anymore take him pet is now insured awesome no don't shut him in let him out he needs to be free there we go beautiful puppy come let's go let's take him on a walkie oh look it's brothers come here brother brother give him kisses get that filthy mole out of him put him back under the ground where he belongs hey boys do you want to see my cash deck i really needed this 1.4 bill man because look at this 115k cash deck i mean i don't want to sell my early i just wanted to keep that that's 900 ml right there i guess we'll wear the 30s pickaxe and we'll open up the rest of these hard caskets how how does that sound dude can you imagine if i get third age from this hard closer now can you imagine if we get 30 is there any third age hiding in here is it any oh that was close dude oh it made me oh it was kind of the right color what's that a thieving bag do you know how many bloodhounds you could fit in this baby isn't that wait hold on isn't the pickaxe like the most expensive third age item you can possibly get or is it like third day's druidic cloak or something it is like a mess clue time yeah sell pickaxe i'll keep i'll keep it for a bit but eventually i'll probably sell it because i mean i don't really need money but it'd be kind of nice to see it's that time again where we're gonna wait we opened it by the mimic should we we're gonna go back to the mimic see if we can get some gl's this is where did we drum roll before we got the pet i forgot we'll drum roll are we gonna get another pickaxe now that is something i'm more comfortable with look at that beautifully standard a nice solid 400k now i'm saying a whole lot less than 1.4 bill much more comfortable with that good stuff uh i'm pretty sure even if i got like a third edge plate body from these hard cat es kits it can't top what's happened two ah heck yeah another master clue another chance of salvation we're gonna break in the third age pickaxe it's it's been sitting dormant in that cluster for golf golf darren who knows how long let's smack it no longer a virgin pickaxe it has been broken in oh there it goes again the third use here it goes are you ready oh there it is oh i didn't see it yet heckin good boy look at that rare papa thanks shlotsa oh my days i just i just ran away do you like my pupper mental you you wanna cease something more mental hey look at this yes yes i do [Music] holy holy guacamole that that's what i said i said no way too uh we we're all gonna drumroll again it's simply necessary that's the only way we get luck is using the drum master me oh dang it it's average that's fine though um i can't expect lot right two hard caskets you want to give me another mask clue oh good meme thanks man i thought that was another bloodhound then but it was a goat sniff my casket you silly papa come here sniff the casket what's in there my dude give it a good sniff what's in there we gave it a lick did you see that what the heck's in there huh drum roll give us something juicy hey boys this is this is this is activating some deja vu you know what i'm saying all right blood puppy we're going in you ready all right bam bam bam good luck thanks man good time good job mr ellie i'm very disappointed you give me that mahogany blank i can't find the zelda music so here we go give me the third page that's all right that's fine that's fine that's fine heck yeah dude 293k and that's nearly 1.5 bill casket unless we get a master clue you ready boys last casket of the stream 100k it's fine it's fine i already got something really good so yeah let's let's sell the loot minus spa the third pickaxe because i want to keep that for a hot second bananas put them in the bank we don't need them in there right goodbye the first different tree of roon don't mind the helicopter or someone lawnmower i can't tell the difference basically the same i'm gonna sell the pages the blessings and the good dehyde see how much our cash deck is rocking up then moving on to the the junkier things of the loot tab i think we're about to hit 10 mil oh boy this is from 150 hard clues and like some masked clues by the third age package oh green cash deck i can buy that man a bond who predicted a third age and then i got the finished pickaxe i can buy him a bond now or not yeah i'll wait for the full cash and then i'll buy him a nice next bond that's everything there's probably some stuff that got mixed up in the main tab like runes in there but i'm not gonna pick those out i'll take the you seeds and the how birds in there oh i just yeah i finished selling everything so 150 hard clues and the stuff from the master clues by the expensive stuff or that expensive thing 18 million we didn't get any mini uniques other than fetish pickaxe obviously and blood puppy let's whip those out look at that ain't it beautiful we did it boys wrote the bloodhound is complete maybe but i'll probably still do master clues but like i don't know what's cool well look a third inch pickaxe on the floor amazing that's what sodium does um yeah well i guess this is where the series ends i guess i don't know i'll probably do steel clues i do still like doing clues and i want to i want to finish off the collection vlogs for every single clue so um i like a roommate give me give me that room do that roommate oh i no i missed again give me the rune medal please oh i got one i'm so happy all right that satisfied me i'm satisfied the next series will just be like oh i say next series the next passive clue scroll series will just be like uh finishing off the collection log uh all right uh collection log clues so let's have a look at the question mark so why i want to complete this oh goodness easy clue that's gonna be a grind look how much it's missing uh so yeah that medium clues is done i completed that collection log that's a bad like six range of boots ten of the other ones that's funny hard clues uh half oh yeah yeah i'm not gonna go for all the third age but everything but gilded in the third age i'll probably go for oh you get robin hood hats from this yeah that's like a fair bit to do still elites oh those will be awful i got when i did my elite grind i got like nothing i got like no uniques i swear then masters yeah i barely barely scratched it even though i've done so many masters i've reached all these are like dumb rare and q tops and mummy legs they're like dumb rare like dum dum dum dum dum rai but i want to somewhat complete them maybe i'll always look at that beautifulness hold on that is pickaxe bloodhound amazing completed i'm calling massacres completely because i are you kidding me all right well that's it i think that's everything hope you enjoyed watching i sure as heck panicked when i got both of these at the same time oh my goodness it's jakey but the next day after i finished recording that video so i know a lot of you including me uh would be interested on the actual chances what were the actual chances of me getting a third aged pickaxe and a bloodhound from the same clue now mr c baby or at cedar rs on twitter broke down the math for me so to get an unspecific piece of third age from a mimic casket along with a pet from the same mimic casket is one in two hundred and seven thousand but i think it's fair to calculate uh specifically the third age pickaxe since it's the most expensive piece so to get specifically the pickaxe and the pet in the same mimic master clue scroll it's approximately 1 in 4.7 million and getting them a mix is a 115 chance so if you take that into account and you calculate uh so if you take that into account and calculate the odds from the start of the clue scroll then uh it's a whole lot more rarer than 1.47 million it would be like 150 million or something that's a rough estimate i'm not i didn't actually calculate that so yeah pretty heck and rare is the uh the tldr of that pretty rare pretty much oh i think i'm pretty confident saying like the rarest thing ever to happen in probably all of runescape history ever probably like this is rarer than triple uh this is rarer than double or triple third age in one clue like just to put it in perspective it's rarer than that so i'm pretty sure this is the rarest thing ever to happen anyway sorry yes back to yesterday jakey and uh yeah a good meme uh tell me what you want to see do you want to see defense tank videos you want to see i'm taking new bossing videos do you want to see more clue scroll videos who knows uh yeah let me know and i'll see you in the next video [Music] you
