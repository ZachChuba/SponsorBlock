you starting her my starting I'll gonna start I don't how to start it I'm bad about this you gotta start it [Music] hello hey guys welcome to another episode we're doing a an Alfa Romeo an Alfa Romeo and just Giuseppe that the amount of Romeo Giulia de Julio ti yeah alfa romeo giulia TI kind of like a Ferrari but a cheaper for are you guys gonna say it's a budget further I've really budget for our yeah these things starts at 38,000 something some that is about budget yet 38 grand is the starting price this is the TI though so it's not it's 38 the TI starts at like forty one thousand forty or forty one thousand and then with options they can go up into like the low 50s okay and then I'm pretty reasonable so pretty reasonable then the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio which is like they're really sporty version goes up to 70 plus thousand dollars you're getting a little spicy this is the julia was the first mass-produced Alfa Romeo that the company has sold in the United States in over 20 years Wow welcome back which is crazy yeah they took like basically a 20-year hiatus came back with this and the 4c and those are the only cars that are selling right now stell vo SUV oh that's right and the stealthy Oh duh so they're doing this the stell vo and the 4c or the three that they're selling right now yeah there's a lot of rumors of an 8c coming out which is maybe going to be their supercar but that'd be cool those are just rumors I have seen quite a few of these and I've seen a few stell vo as well I think it may have seen more still view see I think this the cool thing about this and at least in comparison to its rivals like BMWs or Mercedes or Audi's or Lexus's or Acuras is these are so much more uncommon yeah three to one takes a little bit then it starts to go ed sorry that's the turbo lag turbo lag and 60 there that's not bad that's not bad it's quick yeah once it once it really catches up cuz at first its sluggish and then the turbo spools up you're like okay yeah that's turbo lag is pretty serious yeah start but I mean it's what he expect yeah it's expected you know yeah let's start with the most noticeable thing how about this red interior yeah it's bold I love it it's a bold choice but I do like it a lot now do you know what paint scheme this is is this their Quadra pearl I think yes this is the color I expect out the 4c so many times online because I love that car and I always picked the Quadra Perla really over read over the ran yeah and after seeing it in person I don't know that I would do that yeah it looks really nice in the Sun but in the shade it just looks like a plain like whitish car not even like arctic white it's just kind of like a cream almost yeah so not my favorite color exterior kind of bland but as soon as you open the door you're like oh look at all the red it has got like a BMW style gear selector yeah it has nice cars I'm moving to this weird I don't even know what to call that like egg-shaped shifter yeah with like a crystal thing on it yeah it's a nice design yeah it's fine I mean it's the same as a lot of cars it's got carbon fibre ish bits like around the shifter around diversity I guess yeah and then around the the door handles here like this thing has a bit ago yeah it's peppy it's not bad I was flooring it there though yeah now I will say that it doesn't feel like you're going as fast as you are in this car yeah this does a good job of making it feel like a refined smooth ride regardless of the speed you go yeah it's always comfortable yeah that being said you have a nice infotainment system it seems like pretty average time you do like how its kind of blended into the dash there that was not like just a rectangle that's sticking yeah hovers hovers it's just like integrated yeah into it which I do like driving position is good I do think I don't know how I feel about this the paddles here that you have to downshift an upshift if you want to set it in manual mode or on the column yes there on the column they're not part of the actual wheel itself which I've never driven a car like that before so to me that's a little weird it's unusual to get used to I it's a cool idea because it of thinking there is that you can shift at whatever no matter where your hands are on the wheel yeah ultimately it is a cool idea and I do like it yeah and I like how big they are they're not tiny little fat they're enormous these paddles are the biggest paddles I've ever seen in any car I have ever driven it's like a boomerang it really is like a boom there are two boomerangs on either side of you I love it a huge you can very comfortably fit five people you can even fit somebody a little taller back there easy yeah we had our driver was driving this and he's how tall it 6 feet six foot yeah and he put the seat way back and I sat behind him and I still have plenty of legroom you have good trunk space great role-based you could easily fit two of me this has a turbocharged 2-liter four-cylinder engine yeah and it produces 280 horsepower so it's like it's enough to get out of its own way happy yeah yeah you're not gonna cause any trouble on the highway or anything it's one zero to sixteen five point two five point two so that's a tenth of a second slower than the base model model three I mean it's it's a sedan this is a business sedan yeah this is definitely more this is like a GT car yeah in a way it's like an entry-level GT car yeah I would say almost cuz it's very refined this driving experience is very smooth yeah it's very comfortable you don't really worry about much this is very minimal wind noise you don't really hear a lot yeah that's what I would say that's the word that comes to mind what I'm thinking about this car it's it's refined yeah quiet it's respectful yeah like I I do like let's see how do you do this thingy you figure it out yeah back you go so those have a cool nifty little sunroof yeah bright you just opened up the blind yeah so there's a there's an automated blinds and then there's an automated sunroof I wish the blind was manual the one in the back is manual they've got two yeah and it is nice it does block out a lot of the Sun it looks a little cheap but yeah I mean can't complain can't complain to my dad is there I do like the sunroof and the whole glass panoramic roof no I love it it'll display I like that they did that oh the turning radius is not so good that's so great that's worse than the Mustang worse than the uh worse then this is pretty long if a long car or long car does this half couple there okay so there's surely okay so there's none right here you do have USB and auxiliary ports you do have USB auxiliary ports and a little bit of storage right in here yeah totally not very much so there I believe the cupholders are here it looks like what in the door are you gonna be able to put there that's not even a small drink most place there is there's little cup holders here on the door bins but you can't really fit you can put like some water bottles there there are no cup holders right here in the front that is not acceptable and I honestly don't really even see any in the back is there a divider like a seat divided no well there is yeah there is well that thing down you can reach it oh boy everybody look at him struggle watch him there we're cupholders okay cool so there are couple of that back so as a driver you just have to turn around completely unbuckle and reach back to that divider to get your drink reasonable I know that's that's pretty weird wait a minute what's the Oh does this open this open we're idiot all right well yeah those will fit your normal size drew okay so it does have cup holders in the front we're just stupid we are [Music] oh it's another one of those cars that shuts up it does yeah it's I think that's a little weird the MPG on this is 23 miles per gallon in the city and 30 on the highway that's reasonable which is pretty reasonable and that engine shut off probably helps with that probably but I think can't be much I think that's such an annoying feature overall like driving manuals most of the time when I come to a stoplight and the car shuts off like I stalled it but yeah this is an automatic and it's just so if you're used to driving automatics most of them do that these days that's just something that if you're coming from an older car or a manual it might seem a little weird yeah does help a little bit with fuel economy so if that's more important to you there you go yeah you got that not it not a big deal that's a nitpick I will say after driving it for a little bit I feel a little bit cramped here really yeah and I think it's these these bolsters on the side they are yeah they do well hugging you and coroner's date we could actually yeah which you don't really need to it yeah if I had the choice of a sports sedan in this segment I might take this over the model 3 for a few reasons that's interesting it's cooler on the inside this is way nicer than the model 3 is on the interior I enjoy having a manual mode even if it is shifters yeah I do enjoy the engine noise and I do also like that this is an Alfa Romeo and it's a little more kind of like a little prestigious like it's a little more exotic yes a little more mysterious and it looks a little cooler on the outside I would agree with that so I'd probably take this over over a similar Larry a similarly priced Model 3 so like in like the 35 to $50,000 model 3 range I think I probably would take this over it that's tough I'm torn because on the one hand I love the interior of this car and I love the paddle shifters and I like how it sounds and I like how refined this is but I also really like the model 3 I do I do really like the model 3 - if I could have the $70,000 model 3 then I would papi yeah I would definitely take that yeah but we haven't driven the $70,000 model one of these yeah so fair fair enough and I probably would take the $7,000 one of this over the model for quite possibly I think I would this is like dad cool yeah it's got cool and there's nothing wrong with dad cool it's just like when you're driving around in your minivan and you see this you're like hey that's pretty cool that's pretty that's about it it attracts no attention yeah no one looks at this no one notices no one thinks anything about it I still when I'm driving like hey well if I'll see an Alf alt point at it but a Alfa Romeo because they're still kind of uncommon they're uncommon yeah but they're not that cool yeah they're not particularly cool really so kind of man yeah although less nonetheless nevertheless nevertheless you talking about okay so now that we've pretty much covered all the bases we're going to get into the ratings and the scoring do it most exciting parts so like if we always do starting off first with performance how do you feel four and a half four and a half Wow yeah it's pretty harsh I mean it's not terrible but I'm comparing it to its peers you know let me amend that a little bit it's not I'm being too mean I'm gonna give it a five and a half because a whole point higher hopefully not that's actually what I was going to give it a five and a half that's all I was like a four and a half cuz I'm thinking below five is below average and this is not below average yeah it's not what he means it's it's good it's peppy so next up practicality which is how reasonable it's reasonable you have good backseat space you have a good trunk space you have a tiny tiny lip box and do you have cup holders they were hidden but they're challenging to discover it gets pretty good gas mileage 23 City 30 Highway yeah so seven and a half how do if I to go that high nothing wrong with for the average business guy businesswoman you got a suitcase duffel bag and you've taken it to the airport all that will fit very comfortably in the trunk of this car it's a coffee I'm guess I'm gonna give the practicality of 6:00 yeah a little harsher just because it's no like truck or SUV true definitely true you can't haul anything like there's there's a lot you can't do with this so that's valid I want to give it too high of a score so I think a six is fair though yeah next up value which at the base price of 30 38 yeah great value yeah at this price what is what do we say this was this started at with starting at 41 but I mean looking yeah in the cabin here with option this has does have options which bumps it up to about 50 yeah pretty decent but I personally I think would look elsewhere it has a nicer interior than the Model 3 but not as nice as the BMW or Mercedes the German rivals yeah but it does have kind of an aura of exclusivity being an Alfa Romeo true which i think is kind of cool I honestly I think the values of five I think it's like generally averaged because reliability might be an issue for me long-term yeah so I think a five is fair I agree I think that's a fair score I think mostly it comes down to personal preference like for me the cabins a little bit busy I like how the Tesla's are a little bit more Spartan yeah and they're probably laughing at us because like how we cut corners that's why it's so Spartan but yeah I prefer how it looks this is a little too cool to me okay so what are you gonna give it I'm gonna go to five as well five as well all right cool factor which suffers yeah I don't think this is a particularly cool car I mean it kind of is but you can give that a five - you know I I might give it a five also actually like pretty average yeah it's not uncool next quality like nothing in here really screams cheap to me no but nor does it really scream lecture but it doesn't really scream extremely pricey super luxury either yeah I'm almost tempted to go with a yeah I think I'm gonna go a little bit higher than the five on this well I think I will - I'll go with a five point five I'm gonna go just a little higher I'm gonna go with this I'm actually gonna go I'm gonna end mine to a six oh yeah six for sure all over the place on this I know we are and then the final thing is fun factor the paddles respond quickly like shifting gears is quick it's precise handling is pretty appropriate yeah for what it is it feels good the turning radius stop is Mille - Nate yeah that now I guess kind of affects a lot of things more than just everybody so unpleasant to drive if you like if you miss something makes me nervous yeah it makes me nervous to like do a u-turn yeah this I don't know I still think it's pretty decent I'd give it a 6 on the fun factor it's all over the place I know I'm gonna give it a five and a half five and a half yeah fun factor because it's quick enough for a business sedan but it's not putting that big of a smile on my face yeah this it does the job it's designed to do really well it's a nice quiet refined well tinted comfortable ride and it goes faster than some other cars now let's add the scores together and see what the average is which is thirty four point two five okay the average score I think what's kind of interesting is we rated this higher than what we did last week which was the 2009 howdy r8 yeah but I think the reason why we did that is because we rated this pretty average on a lot of stuff in the r8 we wrote where we've rated very highly on some and very low on others yeah exactly and this was like pretty average like clear across the spectrum yeah decent car I think so I think it's a good car comfortable get you to working back get in style not much more to say than that yeah not much really to complain about yeah it's fine all right well this was our first Alfa Romeo hopefully we get to do a 4c in the near future that'd be that'd be a blast that would be amazing and we're gonna leave you guys with one last twisty run I'm gonna get stuck behind the person in about two seconds again so yes is your first time watching thank you for stopping by we hope you stick
