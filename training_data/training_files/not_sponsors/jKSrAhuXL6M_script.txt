hello I hope you're having a fantastic day it's fury back in the October 21st update of annoyed too we can see in the changelog that NOLA games added a secret wormy thing what exactly does that mean well that's what we're gonna find out today worms got to love the cute little bundles of Earth eating energy until they inevitably which is exactly what then prompted the developers to add the worm crystals as a means of preventing this from happening too often and it is with these crystals that the secret wormy thing is connected however this is definitely one of the most difficult maneuvers to pull off legitimately in game and that is because we have to get a worm crystal from its home down in a holy mountain all the way up to the sky altar above the starting mountain which is definitely way easier said than done if you're of the opinion that the gold biome to the east of the world is a waste of time then probably would not want to try this but if you're anything like me and derive a lot of entertainment and enjoyment from all of these other crazy things that this game allows to do well this is definitely one of those crazy things so as can see I've been preparing the area in advance why because there are three main difficulties of doing this one can't simply pick up the crystal - the crystal will break if shoot it or hit it with a tentacle too much and three you're gonna have to kick it and it defies gravity so if kick it too hard then well goodbye crystal that's why I'm painstakingly shooting water and then freezing it above and to the sides of the area to create walls and a ceiling to hopefully prevent the crystal from flying off into space I know this isn't the most efficient way of doing this but I was having fun could also use one of the Mist spells to help slow the crystals flight and I heard the circle of buoyancy spell works as well but I haven't had a chance to test that myself anyway once this is done we just have to go down to a holy mountain with any spell that can cut through the brickwork and then we can begin our journey let's do it [Music] [Music] and now finally after kicking that thing around for the past nine minutes or so it's the moment of truth that is not what seek oh but it is the worm rain nice that's mo my god chaos and now it's time to go on a worm hunt especially these large worms right here we got a cluster of them it's the large worms the big mommas have a chance have a pretty good chance of dropping a heart like this and that's basically the reason for doing this putting all that time in to kick in a crystal all the way up to the altar above the mountain just her chance to increase your HP a bunch they are absolutely destroying this place the mines have been turned into like Swiss cheese and what's funny is something I'm noticing is when freeze them the large ones the health bar actually falls off of them like he freezes the health bar to like it's an actual part of the worm anyway so I'm just gonna go around and here in the mines maybe even lower than the mines into the coal pits and hopefully I can get them all and then we'll see how much HP I have afterwards because I have already got a lot after about another 10 minutes of searching I have concluded that I have found them all and I have a max HP of 1766 now I'm gonna see if it can be repeated yes it can be repeated interesting this is something that might do if were planning on going on just like a huge exploration run along with the gold biome so could use that to get 250,000 gold to buy pretty much whatever want except for a bunch of perk rerolls and then can do this and repeat it a few times to stack up a bunch of HP especially if have the perk that increases the amount of HP gain per heart could end up with just like a crazy stupid amount of HP the most thing thing about this is that can actually repeat the same worm rain event in all of the parallel universes as well I've actually been doing this working on a save to help me record a couple of more difficult videos and I'm closing in on around 10,000 HP right now which is just more HP than I'll ever need but it's fun and impressive to see your health bar go completely off the screen so if are planning on going on a huge exploration run like this one in which do pretty much everything and visit the parallel universes etc this might be something that would want to do to gain just tons of HP in order to remain alive for as long as possible anyway I hope guys enjoyed the video and I'll see in the next one have a great day
