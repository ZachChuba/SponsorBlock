hey friends welcome back to the channel if you new here my name is Ali I'm a doctor working in Cambridge and this is yet another study with me video where for some reason people seem to enjoy watching me go about menial activities like washing the dishes brushing my teeth and occasionally doing some work the evening starts at around 6:40 p.m. when I get back home from a hard day of stamping out disease and saving lives I procrastinate for half an hour by making a cup of peppermint tea trying on a new t-shirt and beneath that I bought to hide my receding hairline and getting rid of the scraggly beard that had accumulated over the past week work officially starts at ten past seven and for half an hour I'm starting the muscles topic of human physiology by scoping the subject what this means is that before I try and read understand will memorize anything I'm going through the whole topic and trying to categorize the subject into different headings that means that I get a rough overview of everything in the topic and so when I come across specific bits of information I can hang them in the relevant place in the overall structure this is one of the most important and underappreciated parts of effective studying back in my youth are used to relish jumping straight into a topic from page one but now that I take the time to scope the subject first I find that the understanding of the subject comes a lot quicker in these videos lots of people comment asking what specific apps I'm using and while I'm a sucker for productivity apps I don't think there are many cases where the specific app actually makes much of a difference good notes versus notability OneNote vs. evernote todoist versus things it's all basically the same stuff and the important thing is how we understand and apply the general principles of productivity and effective studying rather than the specifics of which app we're using the only exception in my recent memory has been using notion which I won't talk about in this video but I think the design of that particular app encourages our brain to think in more interesting ways and I'll link some of my specific notion videos down below if you want to check those out anyway in this video to make a point I'm specifically not frolicking with notion the new hot girl in class instead I'm using the bolding middle-aged but reliable Microsoft OneNote and typing out all the headings and subheadings from our lecture notes I'm using a split-screen setup in PDF Expert which is a PDF reader app for the Mac with the type of lecture notes on one side and the overhead projected diagrams on the other side which I think our lecturer used to increase his street cred with the students clearly so this is what I do until 7:45 p.m. when I switch over to keynote and begin working on preparing the teaching session for my physiology students I start by building up the basic story of neuromuscular transmission and for each point here I write some questions that I'll ask the students to answer during our supervision the reason I'm writing questions rather than notes is because a they've got the notes already and be active recall ie testing ourselves is the single most effective learning technique ever and I've got a lot of videos exploring this in much more depth if you haven't come across it before but just as a quick reminder if we're currently unhappy with our grades or how much time were having to put into studying for our exams chances are we just aren't testing ourselves enough and if we were to focus our study efforts on testing ourselves with the book closed we'd magically find that our grades will improve and by the way this isn't just my opinion it's backed up by decades of research published in peer-reviewed academic papers which again I explain in much more depth in my other videos about active recall at 8:15 p.m. I get off my proverbial soapbox having been focusing quite intently for an hour and I lounge on the sofa figuring out what to order for dinner I decide on a palo ad astra Romana pizza from Pizza Express and then feel bad about spending so much money on a completely unnecessary takeaway to the money especially if you watch my own classes from 9:00 p.m. I do much of the same thing where I go through the lecture notes really slowly making sure firstly that I understand everything that they're talking about and secondly writing some active recall questions in my keynote for the students if I wasn't interested in making a teaching session out of this I'd still obviously be writing down the act of recall questions again because it is the single most effective study technique ever but I'd write them down in OneNote or notional Evernote or whatever note-taking app I was using that month in fact one of my friends ranked second in medicine in the whole university out of 350 incredibly bright Cambridge University students and the only thing he did to study was write active recall questions for himself and then just go through them repeatedly I'm working on a video where I explain the strategy in depth so if you're keen to find out more then please sign up to Skillshare with my

read a physiology textbook on my iPad while stuffing my face with slightly cold pizza pretty quickly I realized that cold pizza is not ideal and so I give it a quick blast in the microwave which of course makes it taste much better don't at me from 10:00 p.m. I find my concentration beginning to waver and so I make myself some chamomile and manuka honey tea and then lie on the sofa reading the book nerve and muscle here I'm using the app notability to read the PDF and making occasional notes in the margin to help me understand what's going on I also flag up some bits that I think would make for good reference material for the essays that's me and my students will have to write sorry my students and I that was terrible by 10:30 p.m. I decide that I've had enough and so I brush my teeth wash the dishes change into my pajamas scrubs and head into bed for an early night I read on my Kindle for around half an hour these days I'm reading the fantasy book of Rouen which is part of the faithful and the Fallen series by John Gwyn and then I call it a night so that's it for another study with me video I hope you found that at least somewhat useful if you did please do me a favor and
