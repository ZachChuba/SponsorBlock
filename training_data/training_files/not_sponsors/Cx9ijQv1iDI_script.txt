so it's Friday night and you're you're growing out you got this great idea yeah you know what man we should play some retro games because the emulation isn't dying because of Nintendo lawsuits anyway fortunately you're a well equipped retro gamer you've got all kinds of controllers for all kinds of amazing retro consoles and 64 SNES original nests yes Coleco Wow but there's only one problem even though you've got your emulation PC all set up and you got your retro art oh can you turn this oh wow this is terrible everything is terrible you're gonna have to come around you got your retro arch all set up with all your games and everything then you're like huh how do i plug how do i plug one of these into one of these if only there was a solution oh there it is and we're gonna tell you about it after next purchase so go check them out at the link below [Music] so this right here is the bliss box in the box you get the Bliss box adapter which has got one USB B so a USB to be at the back then it's got four HDMI connectors now here's a funny thing that a lot of people don't know there is a huge difference between physical connection standards and electrical connection standards and while you might see an HDMI port that's totally normal HDMI port and go okay so that's a touch for video right you might not always be correct and I have seen HDMI used for all kinds of things I've even seen it used for PCI Express that was pretty weird in this case all they needed was some kind of cheap standard connector that they could get that had enough pins for everything they could possibly want to connect to it and can you walk us through what are all these some of them are fairly recognizable I don't know if they're all labeled that's nice this is nice this is nes this looks like gamecube is the Coleco they ship you the bliss box and then this entire bouquet of adapters so that you could have four controllers for pretty much any retro console you would want and you don't have to go with even the slightly different experience that you might get with something like an 8-bit dough controller wait this for me oh wow this is from us Ness MIDI yeah oh so this is first party yeah alright then does this have an adapter to know oh that was insane we did not think of that so in terms of setup honestly there's not a whole lot you got to configure these dip switches to determine whether you want for play mode or single play mode and then it doesn't require external power you just go ahead and pop that USB in the back it supports a hundred plus types of controllers so everything we've got here I mean with the exception maybe this is pretty mainstream from a retro gaming perspective and it even supports advanced functionality like pressure-sensitive buttons on ps2 controllers in games that support that and it has the ability to detect what kind of controller is in what type of ports so your emulator just with a restart at worst should be able pick up exactly what all the button bindings are without any dinking around whatsoever the last major benefit of this aside from that it's just a single cable solution instead of having a bunch of dongles hanging out of the front of your case is that it is extremely low latency so the idea and we went and obtained this mammoth of a TV specifically so that we could evaluate that for ourselves the idea is that you should have a and as good as original latency gaming experience but I'm not sure if I buy it yet you see one thing we missed apparently you need to reset the bliss box when you change the controller's around I think there was a button here so then every one of them has a button right beside it yet oh well we don't have it plugged in at all dang it when you're trying to reset it and stuff it should say some like kind of yellowy text to the bottom of the emulator that isn't showing up maybe not plugged in there we go wait what hold on I'm just doing mine too is yours working it was working for like a second and then I touched it okay so we had some problems and we have react lived I went home I got mice nests controllers like oh geez nest controllers and my ps2 dual shocks also we figured out what was going on with Luke's PlayStation controller it's mad catz there's also like a fray on the case there's some detection issues there the n64 controllers turns out that was a retro art issue and then finally the Coleco it looks like these are very simple devices there's nothing to really detect but there's a manual override so we're just gonna just gonna try again can we just play some chess games because like the whole thing is it's supposed to be really low latency like there's some there's some part of the USB standard that it's using that mostly gets ignored that's supposed to allow it to the interrupt-driven yeah it's so theoretically it's like the best thing ever okay so can we just do Super Mario World yes absolutely okay because within a very short period of time I should be able to tell I'm like game jam you you probably have more experience here than me but I've also played this game a bunch you calling me old no it's a classic you just were you know part of it when it first came out that's all I kind of zoned out just watching what's going on Oh why'd I do that dang it points for you stupid that's feeling good trying real hard right now SNES tomorrowworld I'm impressed works good versus zero issues from my stance alright okay you pick the game this time you pick the game pick a game where you know how to play it and I don't see I'm not this old we're gonna do this one you hyped me up on this okay we can play another Lynas game I'm gonna be cool I'm gonna be hairy okay good flatland is like pretty into flames have to do flatland which one even am i I'm up here what the heck okay I don't remember any of the control okay I don't even know what just happened there I think having the AI is in here might have been a mistake okay what the heck dude we was at you yeah there you go that's right now you know what's up wait oh boy oh I just picked up a heart I to think and I think I picked up a heart awesome and through a log at me he logs loser oh crap I just got bombed I'm in danger whoa he's got the bomb no so anyway this should probably move on but that's actually kinda the game that I used to play I miss games like that yeah that are just like you can kind of figure it out kinda right away stupid dumb fun yeah yeah okay that's cool I like that so no problem with controllers yeah everything seemed to work fine yep feeling good yeah GameCube controllers are apparently later a thing now yeah okay yeah thank you I heard it sorry which I don't care yeah let's do cleric oh geez what a guy I'm funny to me see yeah whatever I had the crappy analog stick which actually is making more of a difference than it was previously so I've been playing this game with the classic controller on the Wii and I thought I sucked at this game but actually I don't that controller just is not actually very good so wait because I'm perfectly good at the game down 64 control you have right now is better than the classroom oh so much but I mean part of it too though again is muscle memory like there's no way I would have been able to overtake that truck on the classic controller there we go come on baby show me that first place I'm like hopefully I actually hated this controller really I did not realize I just didn't like how asymmetrical they were like it's a weird ergonomic situation here for me are you ready to play some burger time no I want to watch you play first oh I think I'm dead now though yeah so I put one okay so you have to step on something to make it fall go go go you're in okay this seems like the place where I have the most options there on you though I know I just I want them all behind me okay we get to see what this is yeah it is it's free life that's awesome yeah that's right good very good run very good run okay I think we can make it what what so I think really we can draw our conclusion right yeah if the objective of the foreplay from bliss box is low-latency multi controller support then I think there are a lot of the way there there's still some software niggles that a lot of them are as much to do with third-party software as they are to do with blitz boxes implementation but it does mean that the user experience with what with the resetting controllers and restarting your software every time is not amazing yeah and there's the cost issue it is not cheap at fifty five bucks for the box and then seven dollars each for the adaptors especially when you compare it to something like this that costs anywhere from fifteen to twenty-five bucks for a couple controllers I mean seven times two is a lot of that cost but the latency and the ability to have this sitting on your desk and hot-swap controllers as much as you want even though you still have to have a lot of dongle sitting in this drawer somewhere so I think they're on a good path the retro gaming experience aside from our choice of titles actually a lot of fun so I mean Burger Time is pretty mean we're giving it a conditional thumbs up yeah conditional thumbs up still some work to do on the software and the ease of use and luckily all the problems can be software or firmware updated but controller support was actually pretty darn good across the board for us Dreamcast's apparently which is pretty cool yeah ting ting is the mobile check them out today so thanks for watching guys if you just like this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we featuring at the link in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one yeah you like this one and our community forum forum which you should definitely doing implement and floatplane you should join that too and you should probably get a clear vision controllers you can play Bert you should probably not do that at all I am not endorsing because at this time
