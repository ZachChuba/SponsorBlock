the Blair Witch Project was a cultural phenomenon its influence on horror cinema and transmedia is unquestionable given hayek you might in the right place at the right time to capitalize on the growing ubiquity off the internet in our everyday lives when I first covered the historical impact of the 1999 fine footage flick directed by Daniel Marek and Eduardo Sanchez nearly four years ago it was to coincide with the release of atom way guards 2016 sequel ask reboot which came out of nowhere and just last year the sium could even be said about blooper teams surprise video game adaptation it got me thinking about Blair which as a franchise and hi despite having to film sequels for video games over ten books and a supposed television series in the works none of it really amounted to much at least not on the same level that Paranormal Activity cultivated several years later the Blair Witch Project kinda succeeded on what could be cynically described as a gimmick that's perfectly captured the social and technological zeitgeist a sensationalist media and our growing demand for information consumption despite there being way too much information out there that anti blurs the line between fact and fiction the movie itself is secondary to what it represented it worked purely on the idea that no other film at the time looked or felt as authentic that surely it must be real it's so anti cinematic and audience unfriendly that you're left more curious than scared well depending on whether you bought into it or not however the three core mainstream adaptations that followed over the next twenty years are to put it bluntly completely the opposite of everything that the original film tried to steer clear from but does that mean that they're bad well let's talk about it just before we begin since we're talking about people going deep into a forest they probably would have fared better if they like me were sponsored by native native produce cruelty-free a vegan friendly personal care products see if from harmful ingredients such as Body Wash toothpaste on deodorant they sent me this cool wee box of non sticky quick-drying deodorants free from dodgy ingredients like paraben aluminium and sulfate that for me personally as someone who tends to Chief and have irritable skin means that I find it comfortable and smooth to use I decided to experiment and went with citrus and herb all muskmeion I personal favorite cucumber and mint which kind of speaks for itself and charcoal because I don't know I was just curious what charcoal smelt like I guess you can say I feel like a nice home meal at firing eyebots I'll let you test that one eye for yourself perhaps unlike traditional deodorants I find the subtle natural scent to be consistent throughout the day without being overpowering so if you want to try it out for yourself and even help like the channel 3 deodorants are normally $36 but if you use my link and code below you'll get them for $24 which is 33% off isn't that a bargain anyway while you're selecting some tasty flavors for your box let's talk about the Blair Witch sequels so the three adaptations I'm looking at are Book of Shadows which released just over a year after the first film 2016 rebooted that tried to expand on the original story and just for general fear-mongering I have a few things to say about the 2019 video game that I think summarized my perspective on the series and its potential future starting with bucha shadows is a bit of a our docks because despite technically being the most shameless cash-in on the original film success it's also somehow the most complex and unique film to try and make sense off and that already says a lot about it as a sequel to a minimalist supernatural fine food each movie - book of shadows credits its ambitious to say the least instead of simply expanding on the original with bigger production values on jump scares which is more or less what the 2016 film did Book of Shadows goes for a meta film with any film style approach that tries to play into the cultural zeitgeist I mentioned in the opening it starts with a surprisingly introspective introduction by showing us how much of an impact the Blair Witch Project had at the time from commentaries to fan imitations to people banking off a success - even the frustration felt by the locals of Burkittsville Maryland after it became a tourist hotspot and mangled their reputation as a quint peaceful little Tyne after which the story focuses on one specific fan called Jeff who takes a group of people on a location tour off the film consisting of a Wiccan a couple researching mythology and mass hysteria and an obligatory late 90s early 2000s goth chick and from there things get a wild and weird shall we say coffee next year are basically after a night of partying in the forest the group awakened to find all their possessions destroyed and head back to Jeff's home to investigate the surveillance tips only for each of them to begin hallucinating creepy shits because the story needs to remind us it's supposed to be a horror movie it's worrying when a film can be described as both contrived and convoluted you think being a studio Mandy at sequel that was rushed into production immediately after the original became a smash hit would lead it to becoming a shallow imitation of the first film but bucha shadows is one of those rare cases off attempting to over deliver on its premise it's filled with all the typical late 90s early 2000 schlock you'd expect from a cash-in like this such as the awful hammy acting flashy music video inspired imagery and shitty chin fluff goatees but a limits while stylistically it's everything the Blair Witch Project is not the plot itself is actually pretty decent once you decipher what the hell is going on essentially as the title suggests Book of Shadows really tried to lean on the whole Wiccan mythology angle by setting up the revelation that the group huh being marked for death as part of a demonic ritual inspired by such practices however it ends up resorting to melodramatic witchcraft in a desperate bid to be scary and the whole thing spirals out of control to the point of being incomprehensible although it is fitting to the context of the story even if it's clearly not deliverance what is your problem you're with which people lady I'm just here to buy groceries which the film's real twist comes in its conclusion when the group find the Wiccan girl Erica dead and suspect that the pregnant woman Tristan was possessed by the Blair Witch and taunting him this entire time leading her boyfriend to impulsively push her off the balcony to her death after the Blair Witch supposedly manipulates him finally when each of them are interrogated by the police a series of videotapes reveal that the group committed a series of murders while the final team of Christians hanging is distorted to make it seem like the grip deliberately gained up against her and hanged her for being a witch so here's the thing on paper it's a solid concept bots in execution a lot of what director and co-writer Joe Berliner was trying to say and do just doesn't translate all that effectively burning her is primarily a true crime documentarian more so than a conventional director and his style of social justice filmmaking was the me and inspiration for the Netflix documentary aesthetic if that was popularized by making a murderer in fact burning her executive lis produced a fair few of these documentaries and is responsible for both Netflix's Ted Bundy documentary and the Zac Efron film that accompanied it in burning us vision Book of Shadows was meant to be about emphasizing the cultural impact off the original Blair Witch Project it was meant to explore high castes and superstitious and those who felt alienated from conventional society were unified by the film including some questionable attempts to bring mental illness into the equation the opening is indicative of what Burling or ultimately wanted to make and even acts as a partial meditation on the media blurring the lines between fact and fiction it briefly demonstrates the media's growing sensationalization of the truth to the point that a falsehood is misconstrued as exaggeration or hyperbole in fact it represented fake news before fayek news was even a mainstream concept there's even some attempt to address the media's portrayal of fear-mongering violence which feels even more realize today when other fictional phenomenons like the Slenderman led to legitimate attempted murder stabbed 19 times allegedly by two of her friends who said they were trying to impress a fictional internet character called Slenderman I mean it's all well and good burning or saying this spots watching the film you would be forgiven for not recognizing this as the motive the film just does not have the simplicity or subtlety to make its commentary feel genuine and informed I appreciate the idea of higher plays in the cultural superstition to the point it's become a very lucrative industry but then the film gets so caught up in trying to turn its human drama into a supernatural Psychological showcase of [ __ ] where none of its horror feels earned the reason for this is very simple the studio meddled so much with burning us vision that's what we ended up with was a mangled conflict of ideas artisan entertainment of forced bourlingueur to make the film more commercial and less ambiguous by adding more gore and horror elements that detract from berliners themes and while you think the film's jarring style of intercutting scenes out of context and non chronologically was a filmmaking choice it was actually the studio's decision for one thing to apparently make it seem more mysterious and surprising yet all they really did was end up shooting themselves in the foot and making the film more inaccessible and confusing as a result buku shadows was a critical and commercial failure and while it's easy to dismiss it as simply Karma for being a blatant cash grab I honestly think berliners vision could have perfectly complemented the original film and he'll even potentially added to what made Blair Witch a cultural milestone if it embraced the opening aftermath angle rather than the traditional storytelling structure after Book of Shadows massive failure it wasn't until 16 years later that Blair Witch would return with a reboot premiering at Comic Con in 2016 it came as a total surprise to everyone because the studio kept the project completely under wraps with the working title the woods and yes it could have very easily have existed with fight the Blair Witch title but obviously it was done for marketing purposes the story here ignores the existence of book of shadows and jumps 20 years after the events off the original where Heather's brother geum's discovers a YouTube video containing what he believes to be his missing sister and puts together a team to track her down it's pretty much a by-the-numbers find footage flick that goes back to basics and manages to elevate itself by generally kneeling most office cares with a more bombastic provocative and stylized execution [Music] I understand a lot of purists off the original we'll hear it for these reasons but what's so wonderful about wing arts films is high in touch he is with younger modern audiences the film knows it can't replicate the magic off the originals so it doesn't try to nor does it go for the contrived exposition angle off explaining the Blair Witch instead it aims to capture a feeling of dread and discomfort perpetuated in the original while lightly alluding to new information like high staring at the wall stops the Blair Witch from attacking you rounding it off by giving you a few glimpses of a genuinely terrifying creature that at least for me greatly surpassed my expectations of what this Blair Witch really is I always say explaining a creature kills the mystery but Blair which adds just enough momentum to the concept with like completely spoiling said mystery sure it kills the authenticity but you've had over 20 years to realize it's all [ __ ] so I don't think it attracts too much from the original spirit and simply modernize it to appeal to an audience night desensitized to authenticity again it doesn't try to force any definitive answers but instead it gives you ambiguous nuggets of information to piece together your own understanding off the events that transpire such as the inescapable time loop the emphases on tree symbolism and this shocking body war sequence that while slightly out of place plays into how much una pittance the Blair Witch has over the forest [Music] dare I say it's even possible to argue that it makes the original more effective from a conceptual point of view because it adds a greater cosmic angle which goes hand-in-hand with Book of Shadows despite it being treated as non-canon sure we definitely don't need this information but it doesn't hurt it either especially when it's convincingly well executed that you can forgive some of its shortcomings the sign design is especially spectacular while the forest isn't much to look at the film signs ferociously brooding almost the entire time and gets increasingly more otherworldly and unnatural as we get deeper into the forest there is a persistent feeling like something is watching the group the entire time and while there are a few typical jump scares some do legitimately work and add to the disorientation and hysteria ethan Utley leans on the younger excitable cried and even applies a few modern twists like GoPros and drones yet it doesn't really do anything commentated with it like the original day with the whole accessibility of mobile technology all it does is serve to give us multiple angles off events which is just straight-up cheating to be honest although you could say on a cultural level Blair which can be viewed as an indirect contrast to high audience tastes and sensibilities have changed over the years one is minimalistic subtle draw nights even boring while the other has a shorter more hyperactive attention span where it needs to confront its audience more directly to Guillen a reaction hell it's even reflected onto the characters where the originals cast were patient prepared and respectful unlike the 2016 version where the characters are the complete opposite due to high dependent we become on a technologically and globally modernized world so earlier when I mentioned fear-mongering regarding the video game adaptation what I meant was that after playing thus qiyam I can totally see Blair Witch becoming a Cloverfield situation where you take any fine footage story set in a forest slap a few connections to the original on there and voila you're a Blair Witch property that's exactly what the 2019 video game adaptation is don't get me wrong it's a service ibly creepy walking simulator with impeccable sign design reminiscent of the 2016 film and the brilliant climax where you explore the infamous heist but other than the spooky forest totems and a camcorder it's so far removed from Blair Witch on a narrative level the story follows a war veteran called Ellis as he joins a search party looking for a missing child in the Black Hills forests of Burkittsville where the events of the first film took place eventually Alice gets stuck in a time loop and gradually unravels as he hunts down a serial killer while experiencing hallucinations of his days in the military and battling these creepy phantom monsters that look like the creatures from the live-action scooby-doo movie again like Cloverfield if you remove the title it's easier to view the narrative a lot less cynically because the game basically just becomes another cliche flashy psychological horror dealing with grief and post-traumatic stress disorder because that's today's fashionably emotional character traits oh yeah for there is a good dog called bullet that accompanies you throughout so it gets an immediate anat and I I just I don't make the rules that's just how it is yet it's fair to say the dog also plays another cynical cliche to the story off being your cover buffer to depend on when things get scary before eventually becoming a shallow tragic plot point where obviously the dog safety becomes your number-one priority it does have a pretty effective sequence where you find bullet badly hurt and the Blair Witch taught you to leave the dog behind which you can do so if you want to escape quicker or you can spend over five minutes in a repetitive look where the game rewards your tenacity for not abandoning the dog for the record no matter which and then you get the dog lives so thank God for that all your actions do is influenced whether the dog leaves the force side or scared Ellis on the other hand is a pretty standard white Neill protagonist who's likable enough to get you through the story and during several sequences where you're able to get signal on your phone you can choose whether or not to contact your ex-wife jazz and try to rekindle your relationship I think giving you the choice to play Alice as reclusive Lisa pressing his emotions or trying to confront his fears is contextually quite neat but again it's painfully cliched and doesn't really amount to much other than whether you want a good ending or not of course it only makes sense to do everything you can because there's more story beats to discover regarding Alice's character so it makes the option to engage or not seem artificial at best the game's most unique feature is utilizing the camcorder to playback tips that manipulate the environment around you you say your path is blocked by a fallen tree just rewind the tape with the tree falling and your path is clear it's a fantastic feature the plays into the time loop established in the 2016 film along with sequences where the qiam disorient eats your understanding of time and location to the point it absolutely Neels the anxiety of being lost in a forest within ten minutes of starting I was already lost and as such the exploration and discovery of new locations does feel earned and comes close to capturing the emotional beats experienced by the characters in the film's it does make it a little tedious at times but the series is no stranger to it so it's not entirely out of the ordinary naturally the combat is the most polarizing issue but it is kind of forgivable in the sense that the game would not be as threatening to play if there wasn't some element of danger although it would have been more appropriate for the danger to be environmental or utilize the sium technique used in the Slenderman game because sometimes the game just falls straight into complete ridiculousness with these silly tumbleweed creatures that feel something right out of a Stephen King novel the game's big substantial twist comes in the ending where it's revealed Alice was the killer this entire time plot twist straight out of the early two-thousands as you'd expect so while it's era-appropriate i guess it is cheap to today's standards the real point I want to make about the qiam is that it really shows you the evolution of the Blair Witch series as a whole going from a minimalist thriller about a bunch of kids lost in a forest to a psychological horror of a time distortion to a return to minimalism combined with a creature feature to this Frankenstein mishmash of every single hope imaginable a buddy traumatized war veteran turned a child napping serial killer as a journey it actually represents an evolution or rather in some cases ad evolution off mainstream horror it's not to say that genre is feeling if anything it's on format the minutes but with each new major release Studios seem to struggle to comprehend what audiences really want hell they don't even know what they really want we all love a bit of everything sure but mainstream horror sits in a paradox of trying way too hard to show so little an innovative socially relevant horror that tapped into our fear of the unknown is nigh a product of modern complacency to trust an audience to have patience because well as the 2016 film demonstrated younger audiences the demographic willing to flock for cheap scare don't have the patience to embrace what isn't spoon-fed to them so are the Blair Witch sequels good well out of context yes they work independently of each other but in consideration of the cultural landscape that allows horror to truly explore human fragility in an age of increasing domestic fear well these sequels dilute to the core ethos off the original to the points it no longer has atiast
