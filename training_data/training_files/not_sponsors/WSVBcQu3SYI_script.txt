Katzenberg was discussing previous events in his life from being a child and growing into an adult this mixed with the idea of doing a movie filled with animals again after all this was promoting Oliver and company at the time but this time they wanted to set it in Africa filled with all of Africa's gorgeous cultural art styles this idea became intoxicating between the three of them and it was on this one long flight where the seeds were born for the movie which would later become the Lion King during the course of the flight the trio will work together to create a basic storyline version of the eventual classic and excitement filled the Boeing upon completion of the rescuers down under produce at home a Schumacher jumped on board too because and I quote lions are cool and the basic idea that was formed over microwavable airplane grub started to develop into a real story when Charlie Fink the vice president for creative affairs at Walt Disney Feature animation developed it even further whilst all this was going on Disney's animation really started to hit hard and break records with such titles as The Little Mermaid and eventually Aladdin the animators who worked on them were given the choice to evil work on an adaption of Pocahontas or what was then known as the king of the jungle excitement had already been filling up each room in the Burbank studios of these two movies not only being enormous success stories but the Little Mermaid in particular saving the possible closure of Disney Animation and Aladdin doing more than double what that movie did at the box office put yourself in their shoes guys what would you think was gonna work out to be better in the long run pretty much everyone wanted to work on Pocahontas and the leads of the Lion King project had to literally beg people to work on their movie with them governess far as to give younger artists lead character roles for the first time ever in a way of persuasion and of course getting animators that were simply obsessed with drawing animals involved - what resulted was a bit of friendly competition between the obvious gonna do well Pocahontas and a team of ready to go roaring animators pun intended to show that their b-movie could stand up against generic Disney movies filled to the brim with princess love songs yes thank you comments section I know Nala is a princess move on the team is ready to go but before they could get to work changes had to be made king of the jungle king of the beasts King of Kalahari seriously guys this movie had so many different reworkings and titles done as is quite normal for a Disney flick but the original story was completely different than what you know it has originally it was actually sort of a war movie between lions and baboons with scar being the leader baboons Rafiq he was a cheetah Timon and Pumba a childhood friends of Simba and what Simba himself well Simba wasn't exactly a likeable character he was brainwashed by scar and never ever left whatever that early adaption of Pride Rock was called huh if it did go this way perhaps working on Pocahontas would have been the better idea thankfully however he didn't as the movie progressed into something we are far more familiar with the animators got to work designing these awesome characters this actually involved them taking a trip to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to better understand these surroundings and to better get to grips with what was needed from them and they actually had quite a bit of time to do just that as storyboarding and constant story revisions were still being done for a further six months and even then he still wasn't done producers disagreed on whether to make it seem like an animated National Geographic documentary or to turn into a musical George Scribner the director of Oliver & Company and originally the director of this movie actually ended up leaving the project over the decision to put songs into it and from there Don Hahn joined the team who had worked on plenty of amazing movies before this and not only gave a full-on thumbs-up for the musical Lloyd number but more importantly he changed the script to be more focused on leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world and over the next two weeks a final rewrite was done with the help of Gary Trousdale and this became the movie that we know of today as the final title changed from the king of the jungle to the Lion King [Music] after the film finally got underway the decision to create it into a musical just as Little Mermaid had done and Beauty and the Beast Aladdin we're about to become Tim Rice got involved to work on the lyrics and as you all know he was the one that suggested to collaborate with Elton John for the movie well yes that is true but not originally for those of you that don't know I was a mobile DJ to played weddings and what-have-you in my teen years as a bit of a part-time gig and although I appreciate the majority of music that I had to play every single weekend for what they were there was one group that I truly truly hated a group that I hated so much that it gets me just angry thinking about it right now and before the incredible Elton John got involved to make the most popular animated soundtrack ever for the time Tim Rice suggested someone else who a bar somewhere guys in an alternative universe Timon and Pumbaa didn't make fart jokes songs they instead sang European pop music thank God this didn't happen in this reality and thank God Elton John agreed to jump in now with all that said having elton john evolve may actually seem like quite a weird choice and if this movie came out nowadays well I suppose actually it has the new soundtrack actually has Beyonce involved and I suppose that seems far more of an obvious choice for a film like this think of the marketing power guys but back then it was a different time a time when animated movies especially Disney would indeed have big names attached but they were never slapped in your face like nowadays they were instead used in a way to make the movie better rather than heavily promote it and what Elton John may lack in African heritage any fan of his work will tell you he makes up with excellent melodies and better still storytelling lyrics Elton John would simply be told what the song needed to be about and send it in demo form to Disney who would world would African eyes it keeping the core elements intact make it work obviously it wasn't all Elton John as Tim Rice's previously stated was also evolved as was obviously the incredible hans zimmer and one that simply must not be forgotten about was lemo m who performed a lot of the music for the film including without a doubt the most iconic opening to an animated movie that could easily go head-to-head alongside some of cinema's greatest opening themes ever animated or not in fact it was the incredible opening that really did help make the Lion King what it was if he was working on this project I wasn't too sure up to this point after hearing this piece of music you knew it was something new and fresh if the animators the musicians and all of the crew at Disney could pull it off this had the potential to be the biggest thing that they had ever done if for whatever reason you did have any doubts the opening number will change your mind in fact the trailer for the movie was simply this song the first four minutes of the movie you didn't need to know what it was about you didn't need to know what was gonna happen you didn't even need to see the comedic duo that normally helped sell animated movies this was it six months before the movie came out moviegoers were getting revved up with this intro and that's all they had until June 15 1994 and when that day came around oh yeah you could say it did pretty well tonight for two percent the most successful film in the history of the Walt Disney Studios in his television network debut The Lion King The Lion King was a huge landmark in animation history it was released right at a time when people stopped and took notice to what Disney was doing these are not kids movies I mean kids will obviously watch it hundreds of more times than the average adult but everyone that went to see it no matter what the age loved what they saw this plus the movie surrounding it helps take animation and more importantly its reputation far more seriously today when you look at Box Office Mojo and more there are several animated movies that always hit the highest grossing movies of all time and I'm not saying it started with this movie The Lion King heck I suppose it probably started with snow white but Lion King in my opinion Lion King took it further and the world of animation has never been the same since and obviously when something as big as the Lion King hits the massive companies that own them especially Disney make sure you know about it I remember when this film dropped you couldn't go anywhere without seeing some kind of advertisement whether it be clothing posters music toys games you name it Simba's face or Timon and Pumbaa space got slapped on the front of it you got two proper sequels a very slapstick Timon and Pumba spin-off TV show and the more recent kiddie TV show which I got to say I've both pretty awesome as it's the third movie I really liked that one and obviously as this was the heart of the Sega vs. Nintendo era of gaming when a video game of a Disney property attached to it hits the market it results in nothing but great things so without further ado let's see what they brought to the table Gaming wise [Music] there are so many lying king games and I know the one you want to hear about lying King the LCD game yeah right guys journey to Africa with Simba and his friends in the Lion King handheld game Justin to be king of the jungle do help Simba dodge will be sinful hyena and crush the evil star to become The Lion King Tigers Lion King electronic handheld game batteries not included yes obviously something as big as the Lion King got a tiger LCD game everything ended up as a bloody Tiger LCD game heck some movies only got Tiger LCD games and I'm sure I'll cover those when I get to him eventually but now let's get to the real juicy stuff ooh no not yet you see I remember getting the Lion King animated storybook on Christmas of 1994 for my gateway 2000 PC well actually it was my sister's but whatever they had a lot of fun with it as did I lucky for us right you see as merch started to soar for this movie Disney decided to start pushing their popular properties into new fields and the disney story but range started with the lion king and alladin shortly after it was a tight deadline for media station to get the product out on time and it started this whole storybook range that you may remember incredibly badly as most kids that got the software that very Christmas ended up not having it work at all angry parents contacted Disney support which was shut on Christmas Day and when Disney support returns the mail boxes were full of angry parents and crying children I'm not making that up guys literally crying children one report even stated that Disney was responsible for killing Christmas that year for thousands of children a bit harsh perhaps behave that's what it said the issue was basically not enough time testing on particular graphics card due to rushing it out to market thankfully Disney did fix this with future revisions but still quite a heavy blow for Disney and what was a solid piece of software however one good thing to come from all of this was that it persuaded Microsoft actually get to work developing the graphics engine known as Direct X in September the very next year so technically without this we wouldn't have this or this or this no no no no sorry guys that's far too much of a stretch is it moving on moving on here we have a couple of games found on plug and play systems and as usual they are really really not as bad as people would have you believe once again a big thanks to standstill pictures for the footage your in-depth knowledge on plug and plays is that of superiority and moving back to PC in 1995 Timon and Pumbaa got themselves their own game which would eventually find its way onto Super Nintendo a few years later called Timon and Pumbaa jungle games seriously this is a game that constantly gets forgotten about and it's actually pretty awesome I mean its basic as all hell but the animations in this game alone make it a worthwhile purchase if you can find a PC to play it on that is the Super Nintendo version is good too but obviously not as good as the PC original and why is this game always forgotten about you know why it's because of our other game isn't it you see after the huge success that was Disney's Aladdin as in the Mega Drive version of Disney's Aladdin Disney was on the lookout for a new development studio to go off and make a game based on the next big hit however virgin were already popping buttons at the seams developing other video games and therefore they went to find another studio to take on the task which is when Westwood Studios entered the ring virgin went to them this was before the days of command & Conquer obviously to help strengthen the virgin team Dave Perry in his who worked on the original Aladdin game would work on the design of the game remotely and the rest would sort of be a collaboration between Westwood and Dave's virgin team Lewis Castle one of the cofounders of Westwood initially said no due to his wife being pregnant with twins and not wanting to take on such a big project in a time like this but what's convinced after being invited to Disney's Burbank Studios and seeing the first five minutes of the movie even then the top dogs at virgin knew the power of the opening sequence and after seeing Simba being lifted up to the powerful scorer Westwood agreed to take on the project and work alongside Dave Perry and Cole thoughts as soon as it was agreed Dave Perry left virgin and created his own company shiny entertainment and his hair dye should probably bring up earthworm jim the complete history go and watch that after this and see what Dave and his crew did next but for now Lewis was in a tough spot not only was Westwood now solely responsible for the game but worse still was the fact that they had to make the game completely from scratch building their own game engine and development tools along the way as the software made by the now shiny entertainment boys wasn't exactly easy to use and if that wasn't bad enough all he knew about this movie was the first five minutes that it was very loosely based on Hamlet and it was about a lion growing into an adult and with that very simple amount of information the team decided to make things even worse for themselves essentially creating two games one where Simba as a child and another as an adult the team would design a rough level and the animators at Disney would yet again just like in Aladdin animate the run cycles on graph paper faxed them over and the team at Westwood would need to painstakingly pixel-by-pixel turn those floorings into sprites Disney as you would expect kept their cards close and when the Westwood team needed to get more drawings made or to get more info on particular levels they would find themselves having to literally fly to California and go to the studio itself to compare and share ideas it was a scary time as development went on the movie nobody knew if it was actually going to be popular at this point heck previous animated movies centered on animals besides the jungle book had technically been flops and the same went for this that tight deadline drew closer and closer and finally towards the end of 1994 the game was officially released worldwide only slightly later than the film did but earlier than the VHS home release Disney really did put these guys through what seems like hell back then but the end result was a game that was genuinely unique and really well received the game ended up being the most popular single game that Westwood ever made and if you've never played it you really really need to change that The Lion King for the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo is an excellent game with ever-changing mechanics that tells the story of the movie probably better than any other 16-bit Disney adaption however the game is seriously unforgiving I just play through or at least attempted to play through this game for the first time in about 20 years or so and god damn this game is hard I'm not sure of its due to the tight deadlines but those final levels where you are adult Simba really do push you to your gaming limits thank god I've got a mega wedgie so I can use savestates because certain parts of this game are seriously unfair if this game only had a few more months of fine-tuning you really would have something a little bit better if you ask me however with that said it is still a good game that the more hardcore retro platformer fan will get a kick out of it has plenty of areas that change up the gameplay style which is always a good thing and thankfully that first half probably more in fact is actually solid enough that even if you do die early on you will want to pick it up again and again in an attempt to do it better all in all it's actually a pretty great game and a unique one released at a time when platformers worked everywhere if you have a Mega Drive come and get this game don't get me wrong the Super Nintendo version is good too but this was the version to get without a doubt there was also an Amiga port that came out shortly after NES Master System gear and Gameboy - all of which Minh not as good obviously but still for the most part played pretty well for whatever version you decide to get so what else have we got well based on that original movie on the PlayStation 1 ah you got this game and it's not very good at all the best way I can describe it is early 3d platforming and the worst of its kind seriously guys take everything you don't like about those early games such as horrible controls frustrating cameras horrible attacks unfair hit boxes on the enemies everything just doesn't seem to work in this game I've got no real attachment to the game obviously is I didn't own it but after playing it briefly for this video I see absolutely no reason to play it at all however after looking up the ending online this game did in fact end not only with the killing of scar oops sorry spoiler alert but instead actually starts working its way into the second movie the very bog-standard second movie if you ask me seriously the whole thing is so incredibly mediocre just like that second movie and it's such a shame as the PlayStation 1 actually does have some rather solid Disney games and before using this to perfectly segment our way into the second and third movie games I suppose I should also at least briefly mention adventures in typing with Timon and Pumbaa which is surprisingly well done ain't come on I'm not gonna slight a game like this in one video and then pray something like typing of the Dead in another both the same game and if I'm gonna be honest The Adventures of typing with Timon and Pumbaa probably teaches you how to type a little bit better than this game you got Lion King operation pride lands which is set off the scar is defeated and its Timon and Pumba z' job to bring all the animals back to Pride Rock turns out none of them want to come back and you gotta do stuff like sumo fight them to bring them back it's not a good game with that said it's 100% designed for kids but even as an adult it's weirdly complicated and it just looks terrible too right on to Lion King to Simba's prior to game made for PC back in 1998 and it's actually pretty good it has all of those hand-drawn bits the early Disney PC releases have which is obviously awesome and since she all it is is for arcade style games with a Lion King paint job slapped on top the games are basic but quite fun it's full of good voice acting the art is great what more do you want for a budget title based on a mediocre sequel onto the third movie called Lion King one and a half in some places and just Lion King free here in the UK guys if you liked the original you should actually go and watch this movie by the way it's a basic retelling of the story from Timon and Pumba point of view and it's really quite a lot of fun the game however yeah to be fair it's fine nothing too special very very generic platformer that involves you swapping the characters Timon and Pumbaa to make your way through the game one can dig down and the other one can bash through walls it's not bad it's just incredibly basic which let's be honest is probably what they was going for and guys besides the appearance of characters in obvious other games that I've mentioned several times over in other Disney history indie games videos such as Kingdom Hearts Epic Mickey Brandon bejeweled spy tools there really isn't much else to show you except 19 lion guard games which I'm not gonna do the lion guard is a Disney jr. original cartoon teaching primary or to be fair even younger kids the importance of working together and sharing your toys etc and these games are simply stuff like spot the difference in matching games perhaps I will have him for another history in the games video that will never happen but it regards the proper Lion King history in the games well I think we've got it covered now with the release of the new animated movie as stated we are far from seeing the end of the Lion King and as always that's completely fine with me it's come so far that honestly I don't mind what they do of it now and honestly nothing has ever been as good as the original I'm sure your opinion may vary looking at the reviews on that new remake but still I think we can all agree that the Lion King is simply just a great story no matter how it's told the sort of story that perfectly balances the loss of a father in one scene and Puma's fart jokes in the very next The Lion King literally has everything for anybody so much so that well even the ones that are too called forestall like it too making it the very best Disney movie of all time just not in my opinion but will cover my favorite another time hey there guys thanks for now this is DJ slope signing out and hopefully I'll see you all next time
