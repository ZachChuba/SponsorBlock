calm / polyphonic to get 30 days of membership for free on April 16 1972 the Apollo 16 mission launched it would become the second last Apollo mission to land on the moon though nobody knew that at the time at the time it seemed a future in space was a foregone conclusion it seemed that the moon was just a stepping-stone on the way to Mars and Beyond and that's reflected in a song released just two days before that penultimate of hollow mission on April 14 1972 Elton John released the single Rocket Man a song speculating on stardom sci-fi the human condition and mankind's future in space let's take a closer look to get to the earliest origins of Rocket Man we need to look back even further before Apollo 11 landed on the moon before Yuri Gagarin's first space flight even before the launch of Sputnik the first satellite the origins of Rocket Man go all the way back to 1951 when even science fiction was still developing as a genre that year Ray Bradbury released a collection of short stories called The Illustrated man one of these stories was the Rocket Man a story about a space pilot in the story flying a rocket isn't too much of a rarity it's just another profession the profession of the narrator's father that father tells his son of the realities of being a Rocket Man when you're in space you yearn for home but when you get back home you yearn to be out in space again something about this story caught the eye of Bernie Taupin who wrote songs for Elton John he was fascinated by the image of the astronaut as a mundane job but Tobin wasn't actually the first songwriter to be inspired by Bradbury story he has admitted that he took the concept from the psychedelic folk band pearls before swine their song also called Rocket Man was a much more faithful adaptation of Bradbury story when to Jupiter or mercury to FINA sortable my mother and I Coppens take on the story changed the protagonist instead of focusing on the Sun like pearls before swine he focused on the rocket man himself he started to picture what it would be like to be an astronaut in this future with this in his mind he came up with the now iconic opening line of the song copan put that line in his back pocket and sat on it for a few months before developing the song in full in the lyrics you can see how to open expands on the boring aspects of the job this isn't what we picture astronauts as today and it's definitely not what we pictured them as in the 70s eyes our main character isn't a scientist it's just a man living from paycheck to paycheck but the song is more than just the story and that's because token and Elton John had a unique relationship token would write all of his lyrics and then bring them to Elton John who would write the music this is what gives Elton John song such emotional power the music is built around the world is built to play into the power of story my god given the image of space Elton John created a wide-open arrangement he also put emphasis on those opening lines which set the scene for the entire song in fact this is one of the only hits about John's entire career that begins with singing right away there's no piano phrasing as a kite by then when you get to the chorus Elton John uses a choir of backup singers and ascending slide guitars to reflect the lyrics it feels like you're soaring out into space floating in the beauty of the universe [Music] but in John's performance he has a pained loneliness he embodies the sorrow of the Rocket Man this isn't just good storytelling the life of the Rocket Man isn't just sci-fi it also serves as a metaphor for the life of the rockstar in its own way the stage is just as lonely as outer space when you're on the road it's a dozen different venues night after night it all blurs together recommend even sings of burning his fuse out familiar territory for any rock star with endless shows and endless parties this song expresses a human side of Elton John he's not the man people think he is he's an idol that people look up to but at the same time he's just a person working his job and just as the wonder of space can be lost on someone who's always flying the wonder of performance can easily be forgotten in the day-to-day and mundane repetition and that's one of the core messages of Rocket Man it's all too easy to get caught up in the mundane and forget the fantastic around you the other message of the song is of course one of loneliness filmmaker majeeda Dean channeled this loneliness when creating the 2017 video for Rocket Man and created a whole new interpretation of the song in that video the Rocket Man isn't a performer or a space pilot he's a refugee taking a perilous journey to a strange land and reflecting on those he left behind and that's the power of Rocket Man it's a wondrous sci fi piece about the future but it's also just about the everyday experiences of any human being everyone can find something to relate to in it and that's why the song lasted through the 70s it lasted through the end of one wave of space excitement all the way to another now space is once again looking closer than ever we have our eyes set on Mars and Beyond and maybe that means one day soon an astronaut will be stepping out the door and saying goodbye to their family for a long lonely flight and they won't be able to stop themselves from thinking it's gonna be a long long if you want to see just how it is that polyphonic to let them know that I sent you [Music]
