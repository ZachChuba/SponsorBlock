website or online store make it with Squarespace we just saw a guy get hit in the head and he's down split his head wide open the fans have got to control themselves people are getting hurt December 16th 2001 marks a day that the NFL wants you to forget it was a complete and utter catastrophe a day where NFL officiating was a total disaster and showed how scary and disgraceful an angry mass of sports fans can be but first let me take you back a few years to really put this into context [Music] coming up next on SportsCenter artwork the Browns are indeed coming to Baltimore the Browns make a run for Baltimore leaving no joy behind in Cleveland in 1995 Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell had become public enemy number one after he decided to move the Browns to Baltimore after that season to say that Browns fans were upset would be a massive understatement the NFL was created in Canton Ohio which is now home to the Pro Football Hall of Fame that's only an hour away from Cleveland taken away the Browns would be like if the MLB allowed the Yankees to be relocated fans begged and pleaded for the NFL to give their franchise back and after three seasons without a football team Cleveland got their wish only one season after they got them back their former team had already won a Super Bowl after their first two seasons ended in disappointing fashion they had finally gained some momentum in 2001 throughout the first 12 games the Browns have fought to a a respectable six and six record matched up at home versus the Jacksonville Jaguars this was a must-win if the Browns wanted a shot at the playoffs [Applause] with a minute left the browns down by a 5 they need to score a touchdown but more importantly they have to get a first down now it's 4th and 2 if they don't convert here it's the ball game [Applause] his job to hang onto the football gets the first down clock still running now just spike the ball [Applause] Spike's it and the clock stops with 48 seconds remaining and I'm just wondering from what that was gonna be one of those fakes my body was gonna do now here's the dilemma Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin is begging for an intentional grounding which was true you can't fake a spike and then spike it this should be a penalty and a loss of down the announcers are in agreeance this looks like this will be the call on the field even though it'll hurt the Browns they still have a chance to win the game so this is what we've been told [Applause] that the replay officials on the previous play the fourth down play they tried the two buds the referees on the field and they wanted the ref to take a look at where the ball was on the Quincy Morgan reception to review it replay buzz prior to the snap we'll be looking to see if the last pass was incomplete or complete that's the fourth down reception by Quincy Morgan whoa wait that's not our replay works everybody knows that you are not allowed to replay something that happened two plays ago that's one of the most basic rules of the entire replay system time was now going by there was no words from the refs no one knew what was going on players were confused coaches were confused the fans obviously had no idea what was going on but worst of all the refs didn't know either which I've never seen happen in this [Applause] so they say he was juggling the ball and what Bush Davis is saying right now is we ran another play and like I said in the history of replay Gus once another play has been run I have never seen them go back and say we're replaying another play this left everyone on the brown sideline pissed but there was a much bigger problem that had begun taking place following the game one of the side referees came out and said whoa it was scary to the extent that we didn't know if we were going to get hit by bottles or if the fans were going to charge the field Erik Westmoreland a member of the Jaguars team was quoted saying they're throwing bottles from behind our bench so we migrated towards the 50-yard line with the mob mentality this crowd of angry fans was capable of anything one thing was for sure those refs weren't getting off this field very easy with no signs of this crowd slowing down and the players coaches and refs just trying to stay as far away as possible with time still left on the clock out of desperation this is what happened and now they're gonna call it a game to the game they call the game well that wasn't right seconds to go yeah you can I think this has been just a fiasco by the referees today the fans have got to control themselves people are getting hurt it's ridicu you're only hurting yourself my Lords and the officials are pummeled as they head into the locker room at Butch Davis is speechless he doesn't know what to say or what to do so now here's the scenario the refs players and coaches had all exited the field and were in their respective locker rooms many of whom were scared of getting hurt and at least now they could breathe a little oh wait the league office just called they are making the teams and the referees go back on the field and finish the game it had been 20 minutes and now they're being forced to go back out there and have the Jags taking me to officially end it a member of the Browns years later said quote guys were undressed butch had already talked to the team the jaguars player from earlier was also quoted saying this was a big uproar because the coaches were like hey they're still throwing bottles we don't want the players to go back out there the league didn't care clearly and here's another twist some fans believed that they all came back on the field because they were going to reverse the call the head of Cleveland's Protective Services came out and said when they restarted the game I think that some fans believed that the referees reversed the decision as far as the play with the receiver the fans thought that was a football decision this wasn't the case both teams gathered 11 random players to go back out there just for this this was a complete and utter embarrassment from the referees to the Browns fans in the stadium who threw beer bottles and other items to the league office for forcing these players and refs to go back out there and lastly to the Browns owner al Lerner and president Carmen policy for making these comments as I said I'm not put Assizes fans at all because I don't think it's appropriate today it wasn't it wasn't pleasant I wouldn't I wouldn't suggest anything like that but but it wasn't World War 3 I don't see any any terrible criticism that would be called for for the fans I think everybody controlled themselves considering that they spent 60 minutes out in some pretty bad weather getting bounced around pretty hard depending upon how it's depicted people will understand no one got hurt something very weird happened so fine we didn't have the most stable people in the world sitting in the stands and people reacted [Music] but but it wasn't World War so I gotta I'll see you guys next time [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
