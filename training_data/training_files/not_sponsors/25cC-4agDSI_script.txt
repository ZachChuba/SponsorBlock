the video so stay tuned this video is a continuation of my annoying anime tropes video for this one I decided to focus on six more annoying cliches all of which I pulled from you guys in the comments in the first video as I mentioned in the first video these cliches don't necessarily make an anime bed they just feel overused or predictable nothing wrong with enjoying some cliches the power of friendship we're all familiar with this cliche you have the main protagonist in a long and intense battle with the villain and they're losing badly and getting the crap beaten out of them but in the last moment they win with the indestructible power of friendship you're no match for my littlest power foolish main characters it's no use she's too strong we've thrown everything we've got at her no we can't give up we can still win this I just have to remember who I'm fighting for I can feel myself growing more powerful with the power of friendship what are you kidding me you're telling me you could have just conveniently whipped out your friendship power at any point in the 75-minute battle and we wouldn't have had to waste all this time and energy one of our party members literally died during this fight uh should I leave that doormat heroine she's cute she's sweet she's clumsy she sees the best in everyone and she's adornment I see this type of protagonist mostly in shoujo anime and get that she's supposed to be likeable but sometimes she's just annoyingly likeable this type of character seems to let everyone walk all over her until they learn to love her or until her love interest comes to the rescue she's for some reason incapable of defending herself or just telling someone off when they're being rude to her I can appreciate a cute sweet non confrontational heroine but sometimes I just want to see who throw some hands the accidental pervert name a single hetero HD anime that doesn't do this I'll wait you know how this one goes guy walks in on girl changing and gets called a pervert guy accidentally falls on top of girl and gets called a pervert guy sees the wind lift a girl's dress and gets called a pervert guy accidentally touches girl's boob gets called a perfect it's fanservice but it's done so often I don't know how people get excited over it anymore and for some reason even if it's the other way around the guy is still the pervert in the situation the love triangle this cliche is of course not limited to anime it's everywhere but I'm including it in this list because of how often I see it in anime I don't always have a problem with this trope and I actually occasionally enjoy it but only if the story revolves around the love triangle or if the love triangle is an important part of the story it really annoys me otherwise when the story is really interesting and engaging but then the plot has to come to a stop every so often for the unnecessary love triangle that feels shoehorned in and usually it feels like the same formula I'm just an average girl with an average life but I have a problem I have a crush on two boys at the same time hello I'm the sophisticated princely pretty boor that you fall in love with immediately sometimes I'm the childhood friend instead but either way I'm a good boy and will only treat you with kindness and respect my princess and the hard bad boy that comes into your life after you meet boy number one and you'll almost always pick me in the end because my emotional baggage makes the fans go nuts over our interactions I'm also probably a tsundere the thousand-year-old lolly guys check it out my core is just waifu and all her glory waifu she looks like she's ten what are you a closet pet oh no no no she's actually a five thousand-year-old vampire so it's okay for me to think that she's hot hi yes I'd like to report at the beach episode this one doesn't actually bother me that much but it is funny to see how often this anime cliche pops up for no apparent reason whether it's to fill in time between plot development episodes or just to use that's an excuse to cash in on some sweet sweet fanservice the interactions are usually kind of predictable hello today I will be showing you how to bake the perfect cliche Beach episode first you'll need to throw in lots of cute swimwear for your female characters and to make sure they're marketable enough to make your target audience throw money at figurines next you'll need to add a cup of juicy sexual tension one whole watermelon a beach ball some fireworks a heaping spoonful of comedic relief and just a dash of drama bake it in the oven for 20 minutes and there you have it oh and make sure your ludus character is like extra lewd trust me on this one if Wi-Fi or data over charges on your phone let me know what you've been watching
