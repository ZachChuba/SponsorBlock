hey guys and welcome back to another episode of my main progress series where i'm attempting to max my somewhat newbie main account but uh less newbie every day now in the last episode we got another 99 under our bells that was 99 farming one of my favorite skills and i'm glad we got done with now you'll notice that we're actually very close to another 99 and that is attack we have one more level to go pretty much the full level so 1.2 million experience on that one so i'll be working towards that today obviously we're gonna have to do some slayer it really just makes a lot of sense to do slayer so there's no reason not to do always helps up with youtube algorithm and let's get started now in the last episode i mentioned that i wanted to do a bit of drift net fishing and to do that properly you need flippers and i'm going really dry on them so far i think i've killed about 150 of these stupid motors so hopefully we get it kind of soon well that took a long time that took me almost an hour just to get the stupid flippers how many did i actually kill here 254. so we went about four times before the dropper than that one now for a little while now fishing has been my kind of afk activity i do while i'm editing or just don't really want to focus um but i decided maybe this is a good opportunity to actually start really making the dent into fishing and the method i've been really excited about is driftnet fishing so right now we're getting about 62k an hour fishing and about 80k an hour hunter which is not bad i definitely could get better than that now we set a nice milestone fishing level there's 75 fishing no big unlock there but yeah it just feels good to get two skills trained at once it's really good now just for a comparison i'm getting less than that at barbarian fishing and i'm not getting any hunter experience granted it's way more afk but still now after a little bit of practice we're up to about 70k an hour and actually almost 100k an hour hunter uh so it is eventually going to catch up and we're just about to hit another level here both of them are actually at 75 which is kind of nice now i think if i could consistently get 72k fishing and 100k hunter this is probably gonna be the method i do to 99 fishing now after a bit of deliberation i decided that i'm actually going to give back this guy's basil's jaw for those who remember uh in the last episode i literally just swiped this off the floor uh the guy apparently was having internet issues but he was a good sport about it in the end didn't really ask for it back so you know what i'm just gonna give it back i don't really need the 20 mil that badly and i'm sure this guy would appreciate it oh we got another trade coming in here uh what's that about now one thing i've always forgotten to do is to mount the dig site pendant here i just couldn't ever find it somehow i think it's my third time trying to do it now essentially this will just be a direct teleport to adamant and rune dragons they are a slayer task from durodel semi frequently and they're really quick to do so i think this teleport will be really handy man adam and dragons really [ __ ] you up sometimes but we finally finished our task of five to get the loot and teleport out here before we die again turdell be nice to me please that's okay oh my god i still can't get over how good this task is look we're getting 92k an hour that's like legitimately one of the best experience rates in the game for slayer and probably the best non-bursting task i think oh uh i haven't had water fiends in a while definitely not doing that yes there it is guys oh this is going to be a spicy clue opening that's tragic all right guys second master let's [ __ ] do it more live stream oh what's that hey look at that guys an occult ornament kit hell yeah five mil and 30 purple sweets that is a [ __ ] master if i've ever seen one [Music] all right so we've been doing a fair bit of driftnet fishing and we're just about to hit actually level 79 fishing now fishing is actually like my highest resource gathering skill now so i'm pretty happy about that and of course because it's a combo training method we're actually also up to 77 hunter the only reason fishing is higher is just because i've been doing a bit of barbarian fishing as well yeah i'm pretty happy with that progress so far oh my god it finally happened there is a task of hellhounds we've been really drying them i think it's been about 30 tasks like an entire slayer level as i'm really happy to do those also that's a really good way to train my attack it's a long task and i can get pretty consistently at least over 100k an hour attack experience so this should put me well on my way to 99 attack hey there we go another drop from cerberus unfortunately not a primordial but that is the next best thing i think eternals have dropped quite a bit but they are still worth about three mil each so definitely better nothing and that was on kill count 423 so it seems to me that we're pretty much right on drop rate for uniques and now we've gotten one of everything well who knows maybe we'll finish the collection log for cerberus now another good thing about cerberus is that you get a lot of elite clues which means a lot of master clues i think so far i'm up to like six or seven just from cerberus so they're fairly common okay there's another eternal crystal definitely not unhappy with that that is another three mill in the bank considering we're not even at 500 kills yet we already have a primordial at two eternals and a vacation i think and with only two kills left on the task there is another elite clue scroll been a pretty good task actually so far and that is why i personally really like cerberus a lot of clues a lot of attack experience and a really good amount of money per hour definitely one of my favorite tasks still so there is our 200 task done that is a boost of 375 points i'm not sure what i'm going to do with it because we're up to about a thousand now most likely i'm gonna unlock boss layer just seems like the next logical step okay so we finally got around to finishing a master clue we got all those elites from cerberus uh yesterday or the day before we ended up getting in the cult ornament kit this time well we didn't get anything very good 350k in loot now i think my plan is probably to get to 95 slayer and then we'll have pretty much everything unlocked at that point i think i'll go purchase the boss slayer unlock and pretty much just boss all the way to 99. now while i already have 99 magic i've still been doing all of my bursting tasks on defensive mode which has given me a significant amount of defense experience and player experience and i think the next task probably will give it to me and that's going to be dust devils once again there we go actually i haven't trained defense since the 70s actually i've just been doing chaining on defensive mode and bursting on defensive mode okay this task definitely will do it there is 94 defense only five more levels to go till we have max defense one more to max attack as we're approaching mac's melee combat very soon at that point i'm probably going to go get prayer up and then we'll be a hundred percent maxed combat oh my god i ran out of bursting runes but there's only one more left to kill so we're just thwacking his head in wait a second no i got trolled by runelight okay our next task is degnos and we have a really exciting level coming in 93 slayer that is a huge milestone we now have unlocked the smoke devil uh which is a really good task i've never tried before on top of that only means we have two more levels so we've unlocked every slayer monster in the entire game and then we can finally try out the alchemical hydro which i'm really excited to try oh thank you jordel you are finally coming in with a hell out task finally we can do more cerberus and that actually is going to put me very very close to 99 attack we only have about four or five more hours left of attack training oh there it is we've now completed all of cerberus's unique drops uh minus the pet and the jar i think that's kind of exciting actually and the smoldering stone is worth more than page asians i mean like quite a bit more uh speaking of asians there is another pagasian crystal on killcount 578. such a worthless drop i can't believe it's only worth like 100k and that is it another pretty decent cerberus task still looking for another primordial but whatever so in 632 kills we've gotten 52.2 million loot probably pretty average all right guys here we are we are just about to get another 99 on the account how many do we have now looks like it's gonna be our sixth ninety nine so now indisputably we'll have the highest accuracy and max it possible let's go ahead and do it see if we can get a spec on the guard here come on oh that's awkward redo there we go guys 99 attack we didn't even kill the guard come on feels good there we go we are done 13 million 34 512 experience and another 99 down in the account there we go another skill cape on the account feels good now this one is kind of useful not really you can now stay in the cyclops room without the need for getting warrior tokens not very useful but it looks [ __ ] cool i like this one okay the emote is kind of lame i don't know what you're doing boxing or something regardless though i'm really happy to have it another combat cape out of the way and another 99. anyway guys that is gonna be it for today's video i hope you guys enjoyed it a lot of progress done and in the next episode we're gonna start working on another 99 and we're hoping just to snowball it from there anyway guys thanks for watching the video i hope you enjoyed it now before i anyway thanks for watching guys and i'll see you next time
