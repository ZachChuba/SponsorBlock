once in a lifetime a product so revolutionary so unlike anything we've ever seen before gets released and today it's my privilege to introduce to you bigmouth Billy bass the speaking sensation now with that Mazon Alexa thermal takes a 500 has a modern minimalist design with brushed aluminum panels and dual him swing tempered glass doors check it out today at the link in the video description [Music] come on in close come on in close let's have some fun this truly is as Jake put it a marvel of modern engineering so this is big mouth Billy bass who you might remember from such television shows as big mouth Billy bass the infomercial and big mouth Billy bass the other infomercial lip sings to the spoken responses of Alexa that is so cool dances to the beat of Amazon music reacts to Alexa timers notifications and alarms has a realistic appearance okay we'll be the judge of that and includes power adapter so in this box you will find a USB cable it's a micro B oh no types no types disappoint you know what return forget it yeah we should yeah I'm not gonna throw it it actually looks pretty fragile so there's a battery door on the back here you got some oh you got you got your mountain options here you got your two mountain holes here which you can just throw up you know I mean let's face it you've got a big mouth Billy bass in your rec room you don't mind putting a couple holes in your wallet this will be on the wall of the new employee lounge not negotiable not ago not negotiable David the crazy thing about this thing is that it's not even expensive 40 bucks which is less than an echo dot yeah so let's go ahead and plug that there buddy in there whoa Oh loud mouth Billy bat a big mouth scuse me loud mouth whoa big mouth Billy bass he's a nice guy you're you are something you are something else I don't know about this realistic appearance I think it's okay for will be paid [Music] [Music] I don't know oh wow this is great in the instructions which looked you know pretty complete they've got a lot of filler here so first there's the important note then there's the note not to be confused with the important note then there's the caution then there's the warning then there's the if using batteries instead of adapter please follow the instructions put batteries in though in the most verbose possible terms of batteries in we've got the lyrics of the song it sings no way that's the actual instruction so this if this looked overwhelming don't worry big mouth Billy bass fans you can handle this oh so it's not a fish-shaped echo dot I was even more excited about this when I thought that it was a standalone Amazon Alexa enabled smart device so you can basically just put a big mouth Billy bass in every room of your house and have Alexa everywhere but unfortunately that is not the case so it actually synchronizes with your existing echo now in mode oh okay device hey James but I'm never gonna take me down I swear the old bigmouth Billy bass did more than one song am I wrong I don't know [Music] that's it's realistic look James you're just confusing the realistic look for a message it feels okay hey Alexa what's the weather like currently in Surrey at 3 degrees Celsius with clear skies and Sun today you can expect partly sunny weather with a high of 5 degrees and a low of minus 5 plate monstercat well what you can't just play monster it's a record so he just kind of spasms man so basically you just have like a fish out of water on your wall whenever music is playing that's a bad kitty what even is this hey Alexa that's up I love hop hey Alexa start a 15 second timer 15 seconds starting now okay so we need to get a notification cheese should I try message you or something after after the time I don't know but I also wanted so much to get a couple more of these I think hey Alexa are there any games you can play here are three of the most popular games and trivia skills first does it feed the room so he only does some stuff no now he starts yeah everyday question of the day poses a new challenging question for you to respond to from arts and entertainment to literature and science do you want to enable it yes interesting so it's only like top level menus no oh and if you would like for me to repeat a question just say repeat the question here is your first question of the day the topic is history it is worth 4 points in what year did American President Franklin D Roosevelt declare that December 7th would be a date that will live in infamy you can choose from 1917 1939 1941 or 1945 41 41 1941 but I did not understand your response 1941 it's working I know right 1941 that's right oh you have earned your first history badge at four point so all that's left now then is for us to gut poor Billy here and see what makes them tick so what do we got here we've got is it just one motor that drives both the tail and the head how does that work okay so this motor probably drives the tail I guess okay so first of all so here's our power switch so that's just going over to the motherboard here then we've got our speaker which is going off the motherboard here we've got our front button right there that little doodad right there we've got power to our battery holder so that's right there you can see there then we've got other more different power coming in from our micro B what do you see oh yeah they're right there there's our Bluetooth antenna and that's probably even our bluetooth chipset there's gotta be another thing in there and we can pull this foam out not really much what is this just like how does their focus like I like a silicon kind of feeling Oh what does this just pop off it's started the fish I think you know I'm Billy that's what it's for yeah so it's just one scene this one's for the mouth so yeah but the whole body is just how do I mean I'm sure we're gonna have everyone in the comments telling us what very simple eight-point a helical expr but yes it just uses this one motor here for the head and the tail action well that was somewhat anticlimactic does big mouth Billy bass with Amazon Alexa integration really need to do more than dance around on your wall to your music and then mouth along with Alexa sometimes probably not so then I guess that's where we leave it with a song and ifixit.com slash Lynas we're gonna have that linked below so thanks for watching guys if
