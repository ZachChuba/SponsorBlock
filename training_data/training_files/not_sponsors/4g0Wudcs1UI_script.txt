hello this is chef john from food wishes
comm on the web homemade cheese curds that's where i'm making your own cheese
curds at home is not fast or easy and one thing that makes it seem even more
difficult is knowing that could just walk down the street a couple blocks and
buy an entire package for just a few dollars but I realize for many of you
potential poutine makers that is not an option so I thought it would take one
for the team and actually show how to do this yourself and first up we're
gonna transfer a gallon a whole milk into a sterilized pot and we'll go over
that along with all the other exotic ingredients in the block-post
but anyway we're gonna transfer our milk in one pot and then place that over
another pot that has a few inches of water in it creating what we call in the
business a bain marie also known as a double boiler and what we'll want to do
is slowly bring that up to ninety degrees Fahrenheit give it a stir once
in a while at which point we're going to add two of
our remaining three ingredients the first of which would be some calcium
chloride which we have to dissolve in water first so if yours comes in
crystals like minded we'll have to crush those against the bottom and keep
stirring until it's totally dissolved and what we'll do once that is
completely dissolved and we have our milk at exactly 90 degrees as well go
ahead and stir that in and stir for about one minute and then once that's
been stirred in we'll go ahead and sprinkle over our mesophilic culture
which very long story short is the bacteria that turns milk into cheese and
what we'll do is sprinkle that over let it sit on the surface for exactly one
minute at which point we'll stir it in for exactly one minute and I don't think
it really matters but the cheese makers really want to use sort of an
up-and-down stirring motion although I forget why but as long as we stir that
gently and thoroughly for exactly one minute we should be good and then what
we're gonna do is cover this and let that culture do its thing for thirty
five minutes and basically what we're doing here is given those microorganisms
enough time to get down and reproduce before we add the last major ingredient
the rennet which we're gonna want to dilute in a little bit of water and
whilst our culture that turns the milk into cheese
it's the rennet that's going to make this mixture coagulate to form the curds
so what we'll do once our timer rings is go ahead and stir
this in it continues stirring for exactly one minute
at which point we're gonna cover that back up and set our timer for 45 minutes
or until we achieve what's called a clean break which means if we tear or
cut the curd it separates cleanly with the break
filling with clearway which is exactly what can see happened around that
thermometer but the official test is done on the knife and if are at the
clean break stage that knifes gonna cut right through very cleanly sort of like
you're going through gelatin oh and I should mention after 45 minutes if
you're not at the clean break stage just keep it at 90 degrees until are and
if your curd is cutting as nice as mine we'll go ahead and slice this into cubes
and I usually shoot for something about three quarters of an inch square but I'd
say anywhere between a half inch and an inch is gonna be fine but anyway we'll
cut that accused by slicing one way and then turning the knife and cutting
across the other and then I actually like to do a third cut where we hold the
knife at a 45 degree angle and slice it once more like that which is a little
awkward especially when get to the end but as you'll see when we cook and
stir this stuff it's not really gonna matter because we're gonna break up any
large curds with a spoon and then once that slice we'll let it sit for exactly
five minutes and if are to the clean break stage should see a bunch of
whey start to come out and those little cubes of curd will start to shrink and
separate check it out a few things look as cool as freshly cut curds and then
what we're gonna do is raise the temperature of this mixture to 98
degrees and cook it for about 90 minutes or so stirring approximately every 10
minutes so yes don't make any plans for the next hour and a half we're gonna
keep it as close to 98 degrees as possible covered when we're not stirring
and like I said every 10 minutes or so we'll take off the lid and give it a
stir for about a half a minute and during that aforementioned stirring if
see any curves that look a little too big just take the edge of your spoon
and break them down to a little smaller size
and what you're going to notice as time passes as those curds will release more
and more way and get smaller and smaller and the longer cook them the smaller
they'll get and the firmer your finish curds and/or cheese will be so I ended
up cooking mine for just over 90 minutes at which point they looked a little
something like this and one thing can look forward to
tell you've gone far enough is if kind of gently squeeze the
curves together they want to stick to each other which is you're just about to
seize a very important attribute so what we're gonna do after we think our curves
have cooked long enough is transfer those into a cheesecloth line strainer
that's set over another pot because what we'll do once all those are transferred
in there's pour some of that way through
the Kurds into the pot below enough so have like about three inches but you
do not want it touching the Kurds and what we'll do is let that drain for a
minute or two and then we're gonna go ahead and wrap it up and cover it and
we're gonna adjust our temperature to try to keep those cheese curds about
somewhere between 112 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit and we're gonna let those sit
and drain just like that for 10 minutes at which point we're gonna go ahead and
unwrap it and hopefully if everything's gone according to plan
all those little curves have kind of stuck together to form a slab and I'm
very happy to report that's exactly what happened in my case and then what we're
gonna do at this point is take a knife or bench scraper and go ahead and cut
this in half right down the middle and we'll flip one side over the other to
sort of stack them up at which point we're gonna rewrap it and give it a
little press and then we'll recover and let it sit for ten minutes more and
again we're maintaining a temperature somewhere between 112 and 115 and I
should probably mention if have a sous-vide setup maintaining these
precise temperatures is way way easier but I don't and is still totally worked
out but anyway we'll leave our stack slabs sitting for 10 minutes and then
what we'll do after 10 minutes is uncover and flip it over and yes let
this drain another 10 minutes which is definitely going to be just as exciting
as the first 10 minutes but then some good news we actually get to do
something a little different we'll go ahead and temporarily remove
that from the heat and then somehow someway we'll cut this big slab into
smaller slabs which we will then stack and continue to drain over our warm
colander and by the way this is way easier for uses square pan since working with
Halfmoon shape can be a little bit geometrically challenging so what ended
up doing is kind of squaring it off by cutting off both ends and stacking those
and then with that sort of squarish piece left over I cut that into four
pieces although as you'll see not very evenly okay that was not my most precise
work ever but I think as you'll see it really doesn't matter that much as long
as we can kind of stack and press that all together and it's probably worth
mentioning that the shortcut method here is to not do this at all okay some
people just take that slab of curd we started with and just simply press that
with something heavy and let it drain like that with the weight sort of
pressing out the extra way but anyway I thought I would use a semi proper
technique with emphasis on the semi and then what we'll do once that's returned
to our 112 to 115 degree environment its cover that and let it sit for 15 minutes
before uncovering unwrapping and flipping / rearranging all right
theoretically you're just not supposed to flip everything over but you're also
supposed to rearrange the positions which apparently has something to do
with keeping the heat nice and evenly distributed and basically by letting
this stuff drain stack like this we're creating a little extra weight and a
little extra pressure and apparently our curds will come out a little better but
anyway bottom line we're gonna keep them in this warm colander flipping them over
and or rearranging them every 15 minutes and we're gonna want to do that at least
three more times although I think I did mine for I kind of lost count but anyway
what we'll do once we've completed that operation three or four more times is
remove that from the heat and unwrap it and I'd like to transfer those slabs
onto a paper towel-lined plate and we'll separate those pieces and let them drain
for a few minutes and as can see those have shrunken up pretty good
or is it shrunked up or have shrunk tup I don't know add that to the things in
this video I'm not quite sure of and then what we'll do after those sit on
the paper towel for a few minutes is go ahead and cut these into cubes and of
course pick any size want I'm showing right here how big I like
mine but decide I mean are after all a little miss muffet of what size to
cut it and then what we'll do once those are all cut his transfer them into a
plastic bag where they must be salted otherwise you're gonna taste really bad
and by bad I mean they'll taste like almost nothing so we'll go ahead and
sprinkle our salt in and give it the old shake of shaken and I like to do this in
two editions so just saw the first half and I will open this up and pour
the rest in and we'll continue to toss those around until that salt salt sorbed
at which point we'll go ahead and transfer those to a plates
and yes we'll finally sneak a taste which above and beyond having a
beautiful fresh milky flavor featuring a very subtle tankiness these also have
that very interesting texture or something that's slightly firm and
rubbery the kind of sort of squeaks against your teeth at least when they're
really fresh so I really did enjoy that and found it comparable to the ones down
the street I could have walked in got in ten minutes
and been done and if want can enjoy these as soon as that salt gets
absorbed in but I much prefer to age mine overnight by covering them in
cheesecloth and letting them sit out for about 12 hours and they're very very
slight tangy flavor is gonna get concentrated even a little more but
anyway the next day mine look like this and the texture was just about the same
but like I say I think that taste improves just a little more which by the
way reminds me of a very very mild Monterey Jack but anyway that's it
homemade cheese curds we'll go ahead and transfer those into some kind of
airtight container and those will keep in the fridge for at
least a week and then as far as enjoying these besides eating them as is can
also coat them with a little bit of cornstarch and deep-fry them to create
fried cheese curds which today I'll be pairing with some Cayenne spiked ketchup
and that my friends is one of the great fair foods of all time it's right up
there with funnel cakes and if I'm not mistaken the ancestor of the modern day
mozzarella stick or at least that's the story I'm going with and of course if
don't want to eat them as is or fried
could always settle for using them in a poutine which only get to see
for a couple seconds because that's coming up soon but anyway I really do
hope give that a try after give these homemade cheese curds a try very
very soon so head over food wishes account for all the ingredient amounts
and more info as usual and as always enjoy
