I wonder because I can't approach I look away even though I like you The harder I try to get closer The farther our hearts drift away I linger because I can't see you We're like parallel lines But we can't be, I know we'll end up together somehow I'll wait forever I couldn't tell you, but I loved you Like a dream come true, like a miracle If only I could run through time and grow up I'd hold your hands in this crazy world We keep crossing each other, no matter how we try to come together I haven't been able to tell you I like you I see you, hesitating I guess we're still so young The little space between us won't fill We're like parallel lines Someday, I'm going to tell you what I couldn't I'll come for you, forever I couldn't tell you, but I loved you Like a dream come true, like a miracle If only I could run through time and grow up I'd hold your hands in this crazy world Even when we get lost, trapped in time We'll end up together somehow Please know I mean everything I say Even if I don't sound ready I couldn't tell you, but I loved you Like a dream come true, like a miracle If only I could run through time and grow up I'd hold your hands in this crazy world Promise me this, I hope you don't change I want you to smile at me like you do now If only I could run through time and grow up I'll hold your hands at the crossroads I couldn't tell you But I loved you
