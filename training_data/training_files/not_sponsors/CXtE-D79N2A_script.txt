holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] [ __ ] stupid my name is nine rain and i play runescape or at least i used to you see i used to chop trees i used to mind [ __ ] i used to travel the lands completing quests and rescuing hot vampire women but i don't do any of that anymore this is my life now the god forsaken place known as the god wars dungeon because two years ago i made a promise to myself two years ago i began a grind that would defy all odds and would become so cursed the luck was nigh incalculable this is my journey to break runescape before it breaks me and let me tell you i made this game my [ __ ] tony you're a big fat [ __ ] tech [ __ ] yeah i got yo we gotta get the [ __ ] out of here this has got to be the highlight of the [ __ ] series i'm out of here i'm never coming back this god forsaken place i knew that this would be the end of the account this is where it just ends and dies is this thing on are we good check this wolf blushy how cool would that be okay that's it back to the video so here i am a runescape player but i don't play like normal people you see i've got this special account where everything in the boss rates or slayer collection log is off limits until i've heard it myself i don't play a real ironman because i'm not a [ __ ] nerd but i don't play a main account because i'm here to milk this for content right now i'm on a mission to kill general groddor so i can get these two freaking awesome items unfortunately i've killed them 520 times then i don't have these items all i have are all of these items that i don't want so you could say things are going really well but i won't be discouraged except for the time that zelfo's came in and [ __ ] ragged our kill and got bando's chest plate with a [ __ ] rune sword not mad about that at all or the fact that i have two bandos boot drops and that's a useless item anyways i killed grotor 40 more times and i got nothing for it so then i was like what the [ __ ] am i gonna do with my life i can't get the items and i remember i have a master clue in my bank and one of the items i needed for the clue step was bandos boots which i got so i decided i was gonna go kill chaos elemental to get a dragon two hander sword because killing grador makes me want to kill myself i totally forgot about this i got a master clue a long time ago and bando's boots were one of the items thankfully i recently got bandos boots and an obsidian cape however i do not have a dragon two hander sword so i'm gonna go do chaos elemental and see if i just get lucky i could also really use a dragon pick i do not have one of those and that would be nice so you know either drop would be cool okay here we go everything looks good the gate is open i don't i don't like that i'm logging out i'm leaving oh there he is let's kick his ass should be a piece of cake yes okay was the jewel my first that's my first ever chaos elekill i didn't know that hey brother um do we get out here i think there's a decent chance i make it out i think there's a decent chance we make it out [Music] oh my god it's too funny okay if you complain about getting killed in the wild it's your fault it's absolutely your fault cool we've killed the chaos elemental 46 times no luck no luck but i never expect to get the drop we're just here for the lulls to be uh quite honest i've had to run from picares like five or six times i've only died once just because i ran out of supplies didn't have very many when they showed up let's get the [ __ ] stuff measure me brother brother what are you doing climb upstairs [Music] wait wait this guy come here come here [ __ ] poison come here come here get the [ __ ] over here we're gonna he has to he's gotta run energy no no no no no no no come here dude come here bro no no oh my god he was boy he was getting hit pretty like he's almost dead for those of you who are wondering why i'm not anti-peking it's because i don't have an ags or dragon claws so it'd kind of be a waste of time hell i don't even have a bandos card sword at this point i have nothing i have no dragon two hand i have no bando scott sword they certainly don't have tacits or a badass chestplate not even close but do we have two pairs of boots yes we have two pairs of boots which in turn is actually four boots which makes it feel even worse so we got like 40 kills but then the noble warrior bulby messaged me i knew it was time i geared myself up and i got my ass to general garador dude i'm oh my god i'm wearing a zamarrock zamaraki and robe top instead of bottom this time now i gotta be honest i look like i look pretty poggers bro i look like a cheerleader except i also am wearing a football helmet i don't know dude it's kind of weird i gotta see this i i know what i look like do you remember that indoor football where chicks used to just wear like mini skirts and crop top football jerseys and just beat the [ __ ] out of each other that was actually on espn for a little while i look like one of those chicks interesting yeah i'll see you when i see you what if i said there is no god and then the god wars dungeon just disappeared it just went i was like like that spongebob caveman image yeah like no wonder i can't get the drop what the [ __ ] dude that would be an interesting account an atheist only uh account you can't use any like no prayers no god items nothing that has anything in the lord to do with the gods at all you're like i don't believe they exist someone's like praying melee you're like nah i'll hit you'll be fine i think the other person capable of doing that is luke says he as he just showed us that he can defeat six chads with no prayer i heard about that i don't even want to i don't even want to watch that [ __ ] it's disgusting i don't care instead i don't [ __ ] care i don't have a [ __ ] at this point i'm not even impressed i'm like yeah of course that's like saying jesus rose from the grave on the third day you're like okay and oh yeah we knew that was gonna happen i always hate it whenever i'm going on my farm run and i'm trying to find where the [ __ ] my shovel is yeah you can't find it in my head where are you wait a second that's right it's a spade i can respect the fact that the british are not even like [ __ ] upset about the revolutionary war loss at that point they're just like yeah you [ __ ] got us dudes yeah we kicked our asses nope gotta love the brits the french however oh [ __ ] i have kc and i'm still slaying goblins i'm just [ __ ] doing it bro time for the big bong hit here we go here we go bing bong bing bong [Applause] oh my god i felt that in my nuts the big door of bandos as i walked through that malicious portal memories flashed before me my first zenite drop for the amulet of torture the thousands of barrows chest for the carol's leather armor that one time that kid with the slurpee tripped over his own feet [ __ ] despite zalfos's best efforts i could not be defeated over 600 kills deep in a grind that should have ended at 381 but i had bulby chakram and twin at my side when life gives you a slurpee you drink it and when life knocks you down you scream [ __ ] and get your ass back to general grador whoa i was gonna flex my kill count at 644 but this [ __ ] has 660. i bet he's got like four tacits though probably honestly that's 645 kc bobby [Music] what the excuse me my brain just went a little stupid maybe we should just go to world 342 in the role play world and just just have a little talk with the people that are there be like hello and they're like please don't crash and i'm like this is the only world what do you mean and when they protest we'll be like we are role-playing please do not break my merch well i'm going to pretend to be a bandwidth crasher and and you pretend to be upset with me they're like i'm actually upset with you i'm like you're doing a very good job well these people are very convincing he's literally he's reporting me he's reporting i see you i see you're reporting me that's very i swear to god oh super restored um it's mine don't touch it actually you can have that no that one you can't have that one's yours it's not a trap don't worry you can take it it's right there i see you looking at it eyeing it oh i wonder what it will taste like strawberries you can tell by its pinkish color they call it the strawberry restore the new smoothie blend bananas are the key to any good smoothie including the strawberry restore i'm losing my mind barbie gets tall yes that's how i should slice him open [Laughter] yes dude oh the double hammer [Music] that means i can get tacits on this kill it's the it's uh fate [Music] and loop happens the grind was going great we were full of hope and vigor when i started killing general garador i had 94 attack 99 attack is 13 million experience which means we'd gotten 5 million attack experience since i started this hellish grind that's so good i love that that's awesome okay okay now everybody say it with me this time i'm going to do my anime voice and we'll say the thing but i knew what i had to do so i got my ass back to general that's good enough i don't think we could do better than that one two three four five everybody in the car so come on let's ride give me the task that's grim spike i i know you have them i see them they're sticky out of your pants you little [ __ ] boy give them to me give me the treasure that is nice about this room you can get the drops from the minions yeah you can super nice about this room love that it's awesome dude hey dude the 63 spec dude we're [ __ ] him yeah it's not like that though that's not my thing no i'm not in the it's not that i'm not gay it's just i'm not into big orc guys a little bit of monika in my life a little bit of erica by my side a little bit of bobby is what i need [Music] yoink and yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm gonna charge him like a mounted combatant then the one to gear switch into whippah i'm sorry you probably needed to heal i was i got caught up in the middle good good it looks really cool i was excited bro i'm having a good time come now we shall surround the goblins and dance upon their corpses and we shall take their armor off of them and use it for ourselves haha super cool plan hope that one pans out probably not though nothing what why do i even bother getting 99 [ __ ] attack points of 99's maximum in maximum attack i can't hit it with warhammer i've killed thousands and thousands of lizardmen shamans [ __ ] the leaders of all the lizardmen i kill them with my blowpipe which is a very archaic barbaric weapon do you know how exhausting that would be to use a blowpipe like a million times just like [ __ ] blow piping lizardment shamans just sprinting across the room [Laughter] [ __ ] so out of breath time to pray time to pray now i lay me down to sleep i pray to banter as my soul to keep my bcp to keep if i die before i wake give me the bandage chest plate please owns two peachos there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven of them thank you very much bones to [ __ ] you get like miley cyrus and cardi b you're like what the [ __ ] get out of here

damn green wait who's bulby give me tron oh is that actually a character from something yeah i just thought it was a funny way of saying bobby no it's from jimmy detron he's the guy that goes slap slap slap clap oh wait what the [ __ ] does that mean i just sent you the video who the [ __ ] is bulby don't remember that what the [ __ ] am i watching oh my god i gotta just stop it guard was coming to kill us that was amazing huh but his name is bulby yeah that's some even better dude that is such a good name i had no idea i just thought it was weird bobby can you hear me listening to it it's very loud oh my god what the [ __ ] was that sound it's getting lower and slower what's happening bobby oh no anyways that's too much i had to stop it i don't know how many people nowadays but like get that though i don't know i'm gonna put it in my video so probably more now than there were yo let's get that's good 100 100 000 likes on this one and that way people know about bolby the legend of bolby but seriously guys if you want if you want to hit the little uh the little subscribey button that'd be i still have the beer in my inventory no i'm gonna drop the beer go out here stupid beer i'll pour one out for bandos i put the beer at the foot of the altar and now i will goblin salute please bandos bless me so give me tablets give me blow can you hear about me this is where i am right now what have i got i need to leave this is all right it's starting to drag on more like starting to drag on warhammer space i can't follow that up gays are the real misogynists they won't even [ __ ] women like the one thing women are good for they won't even do it oh my god yep clipping that one behind every joke it's a little bit of truth yeah not that one though how are you doing on supplies there bud i'm doing okay um i'm getting slapped right now so i mean give me numbers bobby i need numbers uh one brew four restores uh it's not a lot it's not a lot of balance but we risk it we risk it for content my irl friends risking their lives and money for stupid youtube content hell yes this is how my dream is exactly what i hoped for come now kill yourself bobby do it on screen i'm recording actually i'll also drink this try it with me again you're gonna like this one oh yeah i'd like to tell you as your lips touch the bottom but i do have covered you know the extreme irony of all of this is i told you that one time that that guy came and crashed us for one kill and stole a bcp yeah i can't [ __ ] believe that happened and i'm still here 600 kills later and i don't have one it's his [ __ ] fault it is his i know that's not how rng works but [ __ ] you zelfo's if you're out there [ __ ] you was that his name poor zappos i gave him such a hard time about it let's take a look at the connection oh god it hurts it hits so much bobby and i were smashing out kc but beneath all the banter a dark shadow was hiding holy [ __ ] bobby i just looked i have three dragon stones that's one in a thousand bro yeah i was about to say that oh it's usually pretty right here my rg is so [ __ ] i have three and two boots ever since zappos descended upon this god forsaken land my rng was cursed forever spoon fed on meaningless drops like the two dragon spears the goblin champion scroll and the grad or pet but unable to complete my task so far i'd gotten two pairs of bando's boots the same drop table as the tacitur chest plate but that wasn't all a god sword shard one in 762 three dragon stones one in a thousand a rune battle axe one in 677 two rune swords one in 406 one death rune drop one in a thousand one silver ore drop one in a thousand an uncut diamond one in twenty five hundred two uncut emeralds one and three twelve and three steel arrow drops one in a thousand each and that's when the crashers came kitted out and max gear and sneering like children they descended upon bolby and i we had not to do but retreat road or hadn't seen the last of me but it was time to change things up i decided to pick up where i left off at chaos elemental and see if i could get the dragon two-hander and complete my master clue [Music] no [ __ ] way that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard you can't get the teleport off on that tile jagex what the [ __ ] is wrong with your game i [ __ ] dance around that guy like a clown he looked like a [ __ ] clown oh my god you gotta be kidding me [Music] the real one ye smile lmao let me have it bro man love your vibes can't do it there's no way he just [ __ ] leaves oh my god i love that i love that johnny my man yeah yeah do it again yeah yeah yeah yeah there it is holy [ __ ] this this is not okay this needs to stop now uh uh guys i don't know what to say uh i got the pet you know i should be over the moon to get spoon fed on the pet but i honestly just want the items we'd killed the chaos elemental 103 times but i knew this next time would be special so i geared up and got back out there [Music] i'm pretty sure i could actually wait will i get a skull if i attack him wait a minute no way dude i think i can [ __ ] on this guy [Music] what the [ __ ] holy sh we gotta get the [ __ ] out of here holy [ __ ] no way this kid just got [ __ ] old i got his armored oh god sword no [ __ ] way we hit him through the melee prayer with the bell oh my god this has got to be the highlight of the [ __ ] series wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute the armadillo god sword one of the most powerful weapons in all of runescape and an extremely rare drop for one of the most vicious of runescape bosses this bad boy is the peace deal a resistance of all pk setups except for dragon claws but you can go choke on a monkey nut if you think i'm ever gonna get those but this is no ordinary armadillo godsword pk so let me take you guys back a bit back to the beginning this account was born from adversity i just got my first ever quest cape and not but a few days later i was hacked they took everything so i decided to rebuild my bossing collection log was completely empty because i'd never done any pvm before and since i didn't want to scrap the account and start an iron from scratch i decided to create iron main a main account with no bossing experience and no money in which i had to earn all of the best gear and runescape by getting the drops like an iron man without some of the [ __ ] grinds like gathering supplies doing [ __ ] minigames or doing clue scrolls it was the perfect account for me but there was one rule one small 10 second segment an afterthought that i put in my first video as a joke i can buy my own supplies but when it comes to the elite gear i've got to earn that [ __ ] just like any iron man as a side note if i ever pk something i'm keeping it that's right baby nine reigns got a [ __ ] armadillo cod sword with the one technicality in the entire series i'm the legendary super saiyan of runescape baby pre-bronze man mode armadillo god sword pk unlock like i'm [ __ ] framed the wilderness will shudder cause nine even got the one tick of the [ __ ] white wolf to back her up now this doesn't really help me kill general garador or chaos elemental and is the episode any closer to being done no square one that's where we are square one but with a really cool sword so i got my ass back to chaos elemental and we are dry that is one yes that is 128 kills and yet again i'm a drop rate for an item and i do not have that item holy moly yes okay we take those hahaha hahaha 146 kill count we got the dragon pickaxe sick okay i still want the two-hander but this is rarer the dragon pickaxe is also oh yes this is best in slaughter raids oh and that's ksle kill count 200. we're still drawing on the dragon two-hander i'm just kind of chilling and killing chaos elemental so i think i think i'll maybe give it another 50 kills okay i've killed the chaos elemental 270 times so you could say we're having a good time i mean the drop that i'm looking for is one in 120 eight we're having a good time holy [ __ ] finally there we are 287 baby and we looking like a chad all right let's get how much is this thing worth 132k this guy's [ __ ] check this out he's so boned okay all right well we're just gonna leave now with the dragon two hander acquired i could finally go do the master clue step even though it wouldn't get us closer to getting the bandos chest plate or tacits being able to use the boots for a clue step was just the morale boost i needed i can go do that master clue holy moly dude i will say though we do look quite cool i mean i look like a true warrior of the of the realm of the realm of guillermo look it's a twitch chat member sit twitch chat member so i grabbed the items i needed killed a flamboyant man in a swamp got lost in a shitty dungeon got ragged by this guy went to this place and then headed to the southern end of morton meyer's swamp to gather a silver key from the shades that resided there yes steel red key baby now i can go through the steel door but aragorn you are a steel door's heir all right you pire log boom asian remains burn them silver key brown baby we got a silver key gold door gold door needs no king no is anyone getting the references they're really good we continued the steps to complete our master clue and before i knew it we had come to the end strangely found in a chest many believe these gloves are the best yes sweet i had them on me yes we got the master casket i have literally been sitting with this master clue and these steps for so long please for the love of god give me third age yo wait yo ale of the gods the gods themself have blessed us okay we take those that's a good clue i'm a happy gamer we're gonna we're gonna stumble our drunk ass all the way home yo this is sick we also got the dragon hallie we got the dragon mace baby highwayman you are [ __ ] loser you're so boned come here highway man come here brother boom stand and deliver [ __ ] with the master clue completed and the highwayman defeated that rhymed [ __ ] i got back to my mission to kill general groudor nothing was gonna distract me from my goal look examine the flowers you don't see that many of these of these what what are you what's this statue by the way i honestly don't even know what i'm looking at is that an ogre or a gorilla or is this a nose ring in the nose of a gorilla is that a mouth i literally i have no idea what i'm looking at it's time to get serious i've been screwing around too much i busted my butt to get here and a little bit of bad luck ain't gonna stop me then i never simpster getting restless without content even if zappos and half of my clan have turned against me i know i have brothers i can count on bando's huge son of a [ __ ] i don't care if i have to kill you a thousand more times those armor pieces are mine all right twin we're starting off today it's 766. we can do it oh my goodness this suck is good today oh my god there's a god sword shot of the ground what yeah we take those i have all the shards so you know it is what it is oh no that's like wow you gotta make that real sad do you have sharks or something i have one i don't know if i trust

fault shark chance gone i will avenge you look i swear i didn't eat him i just set him free there's a part of me that just wants to like i'm just gonna make an episode about shark chat like it's probably the most compelling thing that's happened here in the past couple months is that you ate a shark that didn't need to be eaten that's about where we're at this is a shark chance i've ever seen one chili potatoes one on the ground so my inventory now potato chat potato chip i shall call you potato chips potato chan is with me put potato chan somewhere safe where you will not eat him yes i put him deep within my shorts i don't like that oh never mind you're an anime girl character too he's fine potato chip is having a good time get out of there potato jan i have potato chan and i have shark chan i'm gonna sell all my other sharks and chili potatoes so i know which ones are shark chan and chili potato chat i'm not joking so i did that i sold all the sharks and chili potatoes except for the two that i had rescued from jenny gragrar and to this day they're still sitting in my bank i will never use sharks or chili potatoes ever again on this account we'd gotten 40 kills that trip so we are currently sitting at 805 kc no bcp no tacits and no godsword hilt but the day had just begun oh i got a god sword check no way yes nice that's my first drop of any kind ever here was that off of a minion yeah yeah yeah look at that twin look at that i i hit a fat specky boy a fat specky boy is a fat kid with freckles we've got a rude long short drop oh you know what that means bobby

know he's from new york he's like i look really into mine like i'm sure you'll understand as usual okay yeah now that i've given you the proper introduction to this we have a guy out here who's really into moms is like what a segway wait does guardar own assless traps they should make they should make a tassie recolor holy [ __ ] ah shark chan hello talk to me no stay away come here oh sure come here ouch they're beating my ass don't worry i have sharks in my hand oh more shark chan i i i need to [ __ ] go do another thing in this game i'm getting excited about shark drops at your local door

just be like yes today i get to wake up and eat waffles and feel good wouldn't that be awesome like life would be super easy at that point all of life's problems you just i mean like you'd just be so motivated all the time you'd be like yes i'm gonna go to bed because in the morning i'm making waffles oh my god i just got another godsword shard well down's from a minion oh my god we're getting spooned on more [ __ ] at this point [Music] me me me me me come on bobby me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me meep me me me me me me me meep meep meep meep meep meep meep me me me me me me me oh my god we are so dry is this what starts happening at 829 bandos kc i'm about to reach the kc at which i start looking like a gold farming bandos crasher i'm i'm need to sucky again oh sorry me drop many bones a long wall enemy come near see bones and instead of crash he flee for he fear his his life for our many bones on ground but that worked you drop a bunch of bones in front of the door some some bandos crashes come outside the door they're like diablo i'm gonna have to end the trip pretty soon it's getting pretty late that's what i'm saying i have a pretty early meeting in the morning i'll just replace with bobby and we'll play until seven in the morning and get nothing uh what is that right bobby i did not volunteer for that oh sorry what i thought before we liked doing jenny gragra bob balby hates jenny crocker i thought won't be like doing jenny gregor why you know come to jenny granger with me bobby you lie you not you don't speak truth like ben shapiro you don't tell me facts like ben ben only speak true fact ben only speak true fact you however you lie you you vote bernie you just want to steal from me who has stuff when you have no stuff in fact i feel like people who go 800 dry grador should vote for bernie it would be in their best interest life is not fair and i feel like your drops should be my drops oh bernie i could use a redistribution policy right about now okay so i i've done the math uh just for general garador if i was on drop i should have made 125 mil holy yes so i'm gonna look at my loot tracker and we're gonna see how much i've made from general grotto oh oh 20 mil okay that's that's uh substantially less money than a hundred and twenty i'm a hundred [ __ ] meal behind you is today the day dude are we gonna i think today's the day we just three kills first three kills of the trip yeah all three items we're talking a chest plate again and then kill fours the tacits you know what's funny uh we could get six items our first six kills here and i'd still be under drop rates so i'm i'm ready for the spoon corrador whenever you're [ __ ] prepared butterflies are terrifying if you're an anthropomorphic flower yeah i mean i guess uh under those circumstances oh bro i got 20k even oh i didn't know that was possible beautiful what a useless beautiful drop i just [ __ ] whip specked garador take his run energy dude this is the kill bro this is it you can't even run away atkins used a bind heck it's used by give me the give me the [ __ ] drop the whip spec was what we needed [Music] what no dude i've gotten every [ __ ] thing you could get here except okay we're leaving that's it we're not getting 909. we're stopping at 908. oh we got come on we can do one more you think it goes uphill from here you don't think it gets worse okay it's all up from here dude i can't it literally can't get worse right 909 bandos kc there was a 97 chance at this point that i would have gotten the chest plate or tacits but those were only the kills in my name counting the tanks the real bandos kc was upwards of 1500. so to mix it up i had a jad slayer test sitting around so i thought i'd go give it a whirl guess the healers are dead so now we just [ __ ] all right there's the prayer switch hell yeah uh we take one for the boys do i take another one well just no prayer can you hit an 82 he could have hit that yeah he couldn't hit it he can hit like a 90. i know he's just a little [ __ ] like i totally chanced that one holy [ __ ] oh bro i just got the [ __ ] pit oh no chad saw you give the uh you gave him a chance to kill you and so he's like my boy oh my god dude that's so funny i can't [ __ ] believe it dude this is a pet that i'm excited to have i am i am very excited to have this back yeah that's

rain why why do the videos take so long where's the next youtube video well this is your answer we got [ __ ] you're not even going to see any of this [ __ ] in the thumbnail because it doesn't matter because this is a garage or video we've got the ags we've got an amulet of torture the necklace of anguish tormented bracelet sears ring eternal boots and a goblin champion scroll that i didn't even [ __ ] mention from getting kc outside the room because it's not important it doesn't matter all that matters is i get the bandos tacits and the bando's chest plate and then we get the [ __ ] out of here please i'm that seems ruined squareshield that seems rare hell yeah that's a big one that's a big one right oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] how rare oh all right it's another one in a thousand oh we've already gotten multiple one in a thousand drops this trip by the way the 41 death runes that's one in a 000. wait what what's your case c by the way 926. technically you were spooned on that square shield because that's 1 000. okay you know what i think it's time to go to bed i think it's time you just left i think i think i'll see you later guys i feel like the drops have been generally [ __ ]

world as alphas right now get out of there better [ __ ] better [ __ ] hop dude i scrolled up on my friends list and saw zelphos and green and i was like i got a [ __ ] lead bro cabandos that's the command oh gabandos that the angel boss we're not here to get anything in particular yeah we're just here we've we've stopped asking why yeah or even what it just is yeah yeah yeah we've been seeing sort of gabando's enlightenment wait a minute that one that might be the uh troll holy [ __ ] it's so scary why would you do that i didn't i was not i was looking at the uh drop table to see if that was the rare drop table one get the [ __ ] out of me yeah me too i think i just [ __ ] my dx racer oh finally it's not the tacits or the bcp but holy [ __ ] i can't believe we finally [ __ ] got something it's been so long oh let's get these minions on let's get the [ __ ] out of here it honestly looks worse with the hilt because it's very clear i just don't have the chest lighter test like the real reason you go to this boss yo wait a minute can i combine the god sword blade with that i [ __ ] get it bro we'd finally hit a thousand garador kills the date was april 2nd 2021 five months and zalfos ragged the bcp seven months since i began killing general garador and 17 months since i uttered those fateful words we're going to gear ourselves up and go kill general garador with a 1 and 254 chance to get either the tacits or the bcp we were four times over drop rate with my kill count alone i knew it was time to mix things up my friends have carried me this far chakram bulby twin tank in the hits doing the hard work well i could do it too hear that bandos you stupid [ __ ] it's my time now i started this journey by myself and by the gods i'm gonna end it by myself maybe maybe not man that's a terrible idea but i can at least try i i look at i look at the i'm i'm standing over a uh a pond and i look at my reflection in the water and i and i point at myself 99 you stupid bastard you might not have the skill and you might not have the luck but my god you're charming and handsome and and you won't quit i'm gonna solo bandos and i don't care how long it takes i'm getting those tacits and that bcp so i teleported to the top of the mountain as i had done 100 times before but this time i went alone i was averaging four kills a trip sometimes i failed but i knew the only thing that mattered was getting the next kill as i got better my kills per hour improved and luckily being that it was now mid-april runescape's player base was at one of its lowest points in over a year meaning it was easier for me to find a room and less likely i would be crashed as the days went by garador wasn't the only progress i was making and well it wouldn't be a nine rain video without a little bit of farming now would it here it is boom 97 farming holy cow for reference if you're wondering if you're wondering how long this garage grind is taking me i think in the last video i got 93 farming i'm not sure it's been a long time all right die you seedy [ __ ] clear hispory and the pet and the pet no pad trip after trip kill after kill i knew my luck was just around the corner no you gotta be kidding me god no that's not i'm not even that's not even funny at this point i [ __ ] hate this i'm so over this at this point a couple hundred of these are solos the rest are duo and including the about 600 kc that my friends who have been doing with have gotten we have still never seen either but despite our rotten luck there was one thing keeping me sane during all of this and clear hispory boom holy [ __ ] 98 farming holy cow 1.2 million experience left to go we got a chrono seed we got some white lily seeds i've been farming too much but i'm enjoying it and i guess pretty soon i'll get 99 farming i did a few more trips for a total of 1142kc and was blessed with my fourth boot drop and that's when i got the message kaylee was all like hey i i owe you a bandos tank and i was like let's do it but then i was like actually i'm gonna make beard tank he's already geared and showed up and she was like no i'm doing this because i feel bad i'm i'm also geared with hill count outside the room already and i was like honestly you don't need to tank but she was like i actually owe you for ruining your life i didn't really know what that meant at the time but i was like fine we'll we'll go you see kayla was a bit of a wild card known for causing mischief on the discord server but well liked among the clan she'd even proved herself as a tank a few videos back when fighting krill tsutsura like i said i didn't know what she meant by i owe you but it wouldn't have surprised me if she had gotten into some kind of trouble do you have kc yes okay are you ready to do this yeah let's let's go kick uh garador's ass i got my 40kc to enter the room found a world and started killing bandos and then this happened oh my god i'm so sorry i it's on the floor yes it's a valuable item having hayley how could you do this to me i trusted you i'm so sorry i didn't i wasn't trying i i really was trying to make it better for you and i really only made it worse and i feel so awful this is my fate i [ __ ] knew it the second i came to this godforsaken place i knew that this would be the end of the account that this is where it just ends and dies the first bcp sent zalfos in cayley's name five kills into the trip the curse had lasted a thousand kills the curse that was all zalfos is doing unless wait it happened again welcome back cone to it happened again kaylee kaylee told zelfo's to do it the first time oh my god i was the one that told him that that's why caleb felt bad i thought zalfos was the villain the whole time you have your villain congratulations again you see the real mastermind the true evil behind it all and it had been kaylee from the start so i did the one thing that made sense in a time like this i liquidated that [ __ ] cursed bcp and threw it into a group chuck at the duel arena our clan put in all of our savings and sent it our least qualified warrior imaginable conewolf let's [ __ ] go oh oh he's a [ __ ] tank oh my god he's a [ __ ] tank dude he's you're not hitting [ __ ] come on what's wrong with your whip oh with the comeback you tank these bro you tank these one tank he has pit we lost we were rich but it didn't matter all the money in the world couldn't line up the little icons in the collection log i got another few hundred kills as the days flew by two more boot drops and another dragon spear so my claim came up with a plan there was one noble warrior who was a legend for getting his party spoon fed drops his name was bait we were over 1500 kill count and still no closer to completing our goal and thus began the legend of bade i'm gonna go see if i have a beer i'll be right back our supplies were full and our morale was high so i stepped away to grab a little beverage watch this is the time when he gets it now babe stop attacking do it do it i have so many questions oh my god 1580 kill count and we got our second hilt so i went ahead and just finished off some of the minions if i got one that's crazy you should have the third one yeah yeah what the [ __ ] bailey is the luckiest one out of us a god sword shard in the same kc that we got in the hilt that was lucky but you know we already had that one and i've heard the legends of babe he's lucky but come on there's no way that bringing him was the trick all along ah yes true peace at last holy crap give me the [ __ ] out of here 1595k scene we finally got the [ __ ] vandal tested baby holy [ __ ] oh my god this holy [ __ ] [ __ ] gamers we [ __ ] did it the band was tested okay i have to stay i have to stay and see if i can get a bcp i'm so pumped i look so [ __ ] good i'm [ __ ] hot as [ __ ] felt like i'm so [ __ ] hot cohen look at me dude get in on this cone i haven't done the quest someone refuses dude look at how much [ __ ] less fabric is on these [ __ ] praise bandos like what the [ __ ] [Laughter] you know i kind of feel like there's more fabric on the tacits than on the plate skirt yeah but it's it's in all the right places if you know what i mean yeah that's true two years had taken for me to get my ass to this point and only a couple kc with baden we had the tacits and i could feel the power rising within me so i got my ass back to general garador if you get a little uh rambunctious with the cheese stick it comes back with the vengeance i think it's just like i hit holy [ __ ] no [ __ ] way holy [ __ ] 1600 how did you do it yo dude look at me it looks so [ __ ] sick i'm out of here i'm never coming back this god forsaken place holy [ __ ] 1600 kc over four times drop rate for both pieces with a combined kc of 2250 with chakram twin bobby and babe none of whom got a single unique drop from graudor we had gone drier than 99.986 of all players but it was worth it two years of build-up just for one night you know passion [ __ ] with broad or completed i set my sights on the horizon there was still much to do in gilanor before naive was ready to hang up her sword bando's chosen one it all gets to come to light dude that's so sick bandai's completed baby look at that [ __ ] okay i think i'm gonna quit runescape for a while [Music] i thought i would find you here this is where they cast my mother off after she died they say the ocean goes on forever she was a good woman had a pure heart you knew her and your father yes when will it end all of this all i do is fight [Music] there's more to life than killing monsters yeah like living out your days and nobody on a farm you get to pick you or what you want to be it's never too late to choose yeah well i didn't choose this i wouldn't be so sure [Music] did you really die down in that cave yup cool not really [Music] you
