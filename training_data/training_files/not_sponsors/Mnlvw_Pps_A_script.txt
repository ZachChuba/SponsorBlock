hi guys it is time for another sketch book tour because it's been a while and I found my sketchbook lying around and realized I didn't do a sketch book tour of this sketchbook yet so that's what I'm going to do today it took me a year to fill out this sketchbook and it was a time when I wasn't really that active with traditional sketches at least not in the sketchbook but I'm excited to show it to you but before I start the the sketchbook tour hello everyone so the other day I came across my old like term sketchbook and I realized that I did never give you a tour of this sketchbook so I thought now was maybe a good time to do so and show you some of the sketches that I have in this the stickers on the cover actually mainly my own these free at least because I wanted to test the durability of them and these are just some cute stickers as I found some Pikachu's take us that I got and Lois and I sticker from my husband so the sketchbook is a locum sketchbook let's see if I can find selectin 1917 and I started this on September 2017 and finished it on September 2018 so it's over a year ago that I finished this and that's why I can't believe I haven't showed you guys this yet so some of the stuff in here is very experimental and some of it is also yeah well relatively old already so yeah I've been nervous about showing this to you guys so the first page is like a test page so I was testing all of the miners and multiliners and different kinds of brushes that I had and then I had a section over here with a wet tested my Copic ciao markers but I realized that the alcohol-based markers go right through on the other side and not that I didn't expect it but it just doesn't look good so I don't really use markers in this sketchbook so I have some watercolor paper glued orman taped down to these pages they're just some basic color theory and how many experimentation studies so I just thought it was really nice to put them in here so I could all the ways like flip back to the first page and have a look at it in case I was I don't know maybe needing some inspiration or something and on this side I was just testing my watercolors I drew out the palette as as it is with all the pants in them in the correct places and then I just did some tests with some different brushes I drew my brushes over here and made a stroke with each brush represented on the drawing I the the paper reacted like alright to watercolor but it's definitely not a watercolor sketchbook this paper is super smooth it's more like just regular printer paper but it's a little thicker so so it's a very smooth surface since it's not really mixed-media sketchbook for sure it's more like a pencil ink I don't know what I was doing there so here were my prompt this for October 2017 I think I made it to Oracle no spells made it to spells in 2017 and I have some of the sketches in this one as well and I'll show them to you along with the finished pieces here you can see how different my style was back I mean it's not that that different but you know it's it's still very different oh yes here we start this is actually a sketch for a digital piece of widow manga that I ended up making I remember being a really proud of the digital piece once I finished it because I painted it in a new kind of painterly sculpting way then I would usually do and there's a sketch of my character Elle Owen and which mercy from overwatch and just some random gestures and faces remember the set that this sketchbook is very experimental experimental it has a lot of like studies and style exploration and poses from Pinterest and stuff like that so yeah basically all of this is just posters from Pinterest and I also have some undone half-ton stuff in here this Lewis sketch sure actually turned out to be a big big bigger digital legend of Salafis that I did I think I was like my first real painting in Procrit and here are some sketches for the first day of October way too many thumbnails if you ask me but I think I got inspired for some other prompts as well I'll see if I can so this is how it ended up I actually remember that I took a picture of the thumbnail put it on my iPad then I put this paper on top of my iPad and used it as a light boat to trace the thumbnail it worked pretty well and I still really like this little one and over here are just some random inking sketches that I did on a boat once I don't know what's going on with that body over there this page is a little boring this one is the sketch for the second thing Tober piece this this one I still really like the idea of it yeah it's alright it's alright I still really like this one I remember just when I made it I was considering like meaning it really pretty and then get it attitude because I really like the flow of it but I kind of got away from that not sure if I will do it but I still really like this one this page is actually quite funny because this one looks a lot like Lois's style I think but it was actually a style story of someone else I don't remember now who it was but it was someone else and then when I finished it I realized it look like she looked like you know his style I think maybe this was actually a Louis style study and this is Cyrene and I don't remember this one anymore just some random crown girl and oh this one is also for an October that I did it's this one so I think this was maybe the first sketch and this was second and then it turned out to be this one here oh my god I have to go that back down a little over for that one yeah so this one is the sketch for this one that I did for inktober I don't remember which prompted was maybe I can check think horoscope yeah horoscope because my horoscope is Aquarius and I wanted to do like a horror Aquarius thing and that's just a little self portrait of an outfit of wall this one is pretty interesting it's actually a Copic paper that I just put into the sketchbook of this which I believe she was my first post on my new Instagram so this must has this must have been in October or something October October because October 2017 was when moved to my new Instagram and I believe this was the first post and some Sailor Moon fan art this one is also a sketch for October it ended up being mirrored this is how it turned out I still think I like the sketch the flow in the sketch better maybe it's because I'm looking at it mirrored and it's actually the same thing but I can't see it yeah you know I ever liked it but there's some reason why the sketch man and just some facial expression study I think maybe just for fun yeah so I have a lot of this kind of stuff like loose portraits just some random sketches and ideas flowers lots of this the more of this stuff here actually poses a face and then some some water color swatch inspiration I think I was just playing with colors and I don't know why I put it in here I think maybe it just didn't know what else to do with it no that's ello and again my OC she has looked in so many different ways she looks so innocent here she's definitely not that innocent some chippies chiba designs think we're getting around christmas now pretty boring page random weird faces poses styles not much kind of more of the same thing i don't know what's happening with soldier's body over here some overwatch sticker design ideas face i was starting to get back into droid guys at this point and I didn't really have a style for guys so I did a lot of style studies from Pinterest and this was kind of like a chibi style I developed for some short comics and some and some profile practice over here and this page is just my niece's page because when I was she saw me draw she wanted to draw with me and I had to give her her own page or she would do this to all of the pages in the sketchbook so yeah she had her own page I think this is when I started to really use the red and the blue pencil again which I will probably continue doing for the rest of my sketchbook I really liked what I really like to work in blue and red pencils I think it just gives this nice sketchy look I don't know but lots of style exploration and face expressions this page is pretty boring just a : profile and a really messy little drawing section in me letting go of a lantern because I lost my grandmother the day after Christmas in 2017 so it was really really sad Christmas for my family and the market roaring of a little girl yes and a lot of faces I remember really liking this one I even tried to make it into a digital painting but whenever I started to clean it up and removed all of this sketchiness she just looked progressively worse and worse so I just decided to keep it like a sketch instead of working too much on it so you start to see the feeling right somebody's a lot of female faces style exploration a lot of blue and rats this is basically my sketchbook it's really not that exciting but I'm really doing have you have it I have no idea what's going on down I remember really disliking it I thought that well heck I'll just leave it in there this is just this is the place where I come to play around for stuff and it doesn't matter if it doesn't always look good Mouse was one of my favorite things in 2017 and this is just something I made for fun but it actually ended up being very popular in Instagram and not that I followed these guidelines at all it was just I think was based on some other guideline I found on Pinterest maybe and I wanted to try it out on my style but looks a little weird I think but at least people liked it here's some character costume design a thumbnail and this one I actually tried to make into a painting as well but I don't think my idea was solid enough because as soon as I started to work on it I didn't really I didn't even know how I wanted to approach it like it did I want to include line art or do I want to just paint sculpture her or something what are the colors even going to be so I don't think I had enough motivation for it but I still like the idea of a Valkyrie with a swan so maybe I will do it at some point but definitely not this one I'm not planning on finishing it some funk nails more faces you know the usual drill heat some gold paint that I wanted to get in there I remember playing a lot with this design I don't think I ever managed to finish the piece I wanted to make for her but sort of like a Ursula Ursula octopus mermaid Cyrene something like that and you know the usual a lot of faces and the occasional little guys I don't know what's happening with the Anatomy over here I think maybe I thought the costume was more interesting to draw enough really paying attention to the details maybe I should have it would definitely look better then just some gesture drawing I took a class online at some point where I got the tip to start with the spine and the hips first to really get the flow of the gesture so like in spine of the character and then the hips and then you have like the posture the general posture and then you work on the rest of the character from there I really think it's a great tip and I still try to apply it when I write do gestures then there are some more gestures here and some outfits I found on Pinterest that I wanted to draw or at least sketch very loosely sketch but as seriously guys I mean it gesture drawing is so good for you I should definitely do it more because you learn a lot from gesture drawing and I think these are just like 45-second practices so each body is I'm only allowed to work like around 45 seconds on them more gesture drawing and the cool thing about gesture drawing is sometimes you get inspired to create something so here's the thumbnail for something I wanted to create some more thumbnails that I for something I wanted to grade and this one actually ended up being colored into a digital piece and here's some inspiration for mermaid 2018 so I just had a big Pinterest board and then I sketched out a lot of things that I thought could be cool but I never really got into MMA 2018 I think this process was perhaps more fun than actually have to create something every day I'm not really good at those draw everyday challenges because I tend to be too perfect to perfection allistic perfect what the hmm too much perfection nation I can't say that word you know what I'm trying to say I overdo myself all the time and I work harder than I should have in these kind of challenges and here are some thumbnails I believe they are based on photos I found on Instagram where I liked the post or the lighting or something and then I just felt nailed it down it's more expression some more guys are starting to enter the pages again with the blue and the red theme of course just two drawings time put type 20 poses of 40 45 seconds on May 15th so yeah 45 seconds to get these gestures and I'm not sure what this is and there's another thumbnail for an idea I got with a girl who stands in the rain and she has like these little light balls coming down from her umbrella so she would be like in darkness but the umbrella would light her up kind of like yeah yeah some more studies from Pinterest and some Styles study from Alessandra but Pooky who is one of my favorite artists ever and this little thumbnail here was an idea for a grownup Powerpuff Girls like fashion magazine I'll put it on the screen so you can see it I never finished it I don't know why I think maybe I just thought it was too boring and not well thought out when I got away like halfway through and I ended up doing some other designs just this year instead so yeah these suggest stories from Pinterest a lot of studies from Pinterest in this book more studies from Pinterest with 2d from gorillas as well guys some facial expressions bill cipher some little rats this one this sketch here was the inspiration for my what was it called the Anglo maiden drawing that I did I'll put it on the screen so you can see it no we're here we got deeper and who I'm a bad gravity falls fan because I can't remember her name right now diverse crush and we're going over to some low watch and Rick and Morty here yeah so Rick and Morty and jump around from or watch some random designs and self-portrait of me right now I mean also right now but back then me being really tired yeah more Rick and Morty oh you had this one I was watching a guy called Andrew J Artie on YouTube and he made these hilarious or watch videos and he would pick a hero for a video and when he picked John Pratt he had all of these amazing puns with John Cresson name and one of them was that if he was a handsome guy he was honking rat so I drew hungred because I thought that was so funny but other other than that some exploration of Russian styles I think you single post-its to cover up the worst things numerous guests I believe this star no wait who know this is not a receive sorry I'm mistaking it's not a no see it's just a random girl and more random girls some eyes expressions you know the drill some static exploration up here yeah I got some some markers in Japan will be weather in 2018 that doesn't bleed through on the other page so I could finally start to add some colors there it's just because they're water-based instead of alcohol-based so there's regular water-based markers and there are some expressions and I actually believe I drew this page on YouTube once now that I look at it it looks kind of boring but I believe I was recording I don't remember right now if I actually put it on YouTube hmmm but yeah space elves my thing spaces and more guys are entering more girls again posters style exploration you know it kind of stopped now to look like the style I have today I mean we're not entirely there because it's still over a year ago I finished the sketchbook but we're starting to get there yes more gestures and poses I still really like this one actually I think I caught for her creation and stuff really well guys oh my god hmm and here's my fluffy flamingo - along with some pet rats and some more style and poses you know the same thing you've been looking at for the past quarter quarter like 15 minutes and this is where I started to use a ballpoint pen I need to know it's not I don't know where to put it but it's just a regular black ballpoint pen that I used and it ended up being my absolute favorite pen to use in the sketchbook and these suggest some poses that I was saving for laters illustrations and expressions style exploration and more of that here with a lot of the written the blue these are most honest I think surprise surprise I think we are almost finished now yeah this is actually the last page so thank you my sketchbook for being here kind of a boring last page but yeah that was my little sketchbook I think next up it's going to be this one that you have seen me drawing a couple of times but as you can see I'm not done with it yet I'm like so far in now so it will probably be at least another six months before I finish this I actually finished I mean I sketched more on my iPad than I do in my sketchbook so maybe someday I should show you my digital sketches thank you so much for watching this sketch book tour even though even if you weren't watching and just like to have some background noise for when you're drawing that's completely fine thank you for listening then and yeah I hope you do it and like the video if you liked it I'll see you next time [Music] you [Music]
