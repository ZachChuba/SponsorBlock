classes for free link in the description Samsung's original sin was not being very original now wait just wait this one has a six cents ending so hear me out I'm Renee Ricci and this is vector I've gone over the whole concept of copying several times on this channel already great artists steal yes absolutely and everything is a remix for sure but the key is the remix the copy has to move things forward to take what is build on it and make it better to iterate and improve everything for all of us and for years maybe for the better part of a couple decades Samsung didn't do that they did the exact opposite of that before the iPhone Samsung copied the blackberry with the black jack sure a lot of Windows and Symbian and palm devices looked similar back then but Samsung even jacked the name they put in black and then blatant it stuck in the word jack blackberry sued and Samsung dropped the word black and stuck to the jack but they were still looking at the mine share leader and doing that rather than asking what else they could do to become the mind share leader to become that how they could make what's next rather than making what could sit next to it on the Shelf rather than setting a course for the future they set out to subsume the present following the iPhone when Apple showed the industry what was next rather than trying to do to the iPhone and later the iPad what Apple did to palm and blackberry tablet PC and netbooks Samsung conscientiously deliberately systematically made their own smartphones and tablets look and work as close to indistinguishably from Apple products as possible back then Verizon Sprint and t-mobile didn't have an iPhone but Samsung made sure anybody who couldn't switch to AT&T could have something anything that was just close enough and they didn't stop with iPhones or iPads either they shamelessly copied everything from icons to interfaces plugs to ports dongles to desktops they clone devices like they had Photoshop stamp brush made manifest on the factory floor and came the Galaxy s3 when Samsung finally began to visually differentiate themselves from Apple the shape was less a slab and more a Riverstone the charging was inductive the sharing a physical tap away and the screen would even ripple like water when you touched it but it was just exactly shamelessly what palm had done with the pre several years before even for those who rationalized a black slab is a black slab it was impossible to rationalize a yellow flower on a blue background icon for photos is a yellow flower on a blue background for photos or the shape of AC adapters dock cables and desktop computers are I mean forget it as someone who marveled at the hands bring trio the blackberry the iPhone the Palm Pre the Nexus one seeing the perpetual lack of originality exhibited by Samsung was yeah Kevin Sorbo level disappointing but let's be honest it worked hitching their design train to apples engine help make Samsung the most successful Android manufacturer on the face of the earth and the only truly profitable one at least for alarm while sure it cost them a little in legal penalties but it saved them a fortune in R&D and marketing it was totally worth it but then again slowly things really did begin to change starting with the note now the first one wasn't perfect far from it screen hardware wasn't there yet and the software was well what everyone had to live with back then likewise a digitizer technology but it was different it felt like it could be what came next even though other companies like HTC had made big phones no one had made anything like the note and over the next few years the note grew bigger and bolder the Galaxy S went far more distinctively to the edge there were still some me to designs but Samsung was starting to develop something far more important and identity now today they've gone from look-alike hardware to Galaxy S 10 and Note 10 from the chronic disaster of TouchWiz to the much more consistent much more mature one UI and while some may say they've gotten boring or repetitive or somehow aren't any longer that crazy cousin Samsung the just through anything everything at the wall to see what would stick that losing headphone jacks and SD cards mean they're hypocrites or sellouts no longer as nerd friendly as they used to be just say whatever whatever else you might say about them it's not that they're copying Apple anymore know that task seems to have fallen to Xiaomi and weirdly Huawei but Samsung is still gonna Samsung even now they're pushing out foldable devices before almost anyone else including Huawei arguably before they're even fully baked given the early issues and continued fragility of the screen technology when I first began this channel I said I would probably never buy a Samsung phone and you know what I was wrong about that over the course of the last year from the Galaxy S 10 to the Galaxy Note 10 to even the vision of the Galaxy fold has blurry and troubled as that still is Samsung has crafted a remarkable redemption story and now even though I haven't yet I can absolutely see myself buying a phone from Samsung one day maybe even the next generation fold just like the note they're going to get better and hey they're already great for Skillshare and thanks to all of you for supporting the show Apple to Mac iPod iPhone iPad Apple watch air pods Apple has produced industry changing products over and over again same with Sony Trinitron Betamax in beta cam Walkman 3.5 inch floppy disk PlayStation there are companies just a few companies that can boast long lists of products that are iconic that changed consumer technology forever has Samsung by virtue of things like the Galaxy S 10 in Galaxy Note 10 inhale appliances earned its place on that list as well that's where you come in hit like if you do hit subscribe if you haven't already and Samsung smashed that Bell gizmo so YouTube will actually tell you when the next video goes live and then hit up the comments and let me know is Samsung now iconic thank you for watching see you next video
