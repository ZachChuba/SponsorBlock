so you're watching your favorite medical TV drama it's getting super intense there's a critically ill patient and all of a sudden he flatlines BAM the doctors on the scene he or she pulls out the paddles and shots clear the patient major Cabot I'm boom the patient's Hardware starts they wake up normally without tooth yours I'm the patient lives everyone celebrates and the doctor is a hero right well this isn't what happens in real life at all so the machine that they used helped revive a patient who has suffered a heart attack or a cardiac arrest is called a defibrillator and it does so by providing an electric shock and allowing clinicians to begin CPR ah stayin alive on TV however the defibrillators must be magical because they work quite differently and have a much higher success rate than they do in real life the thing is is that on TV differe abilities seem to work by restarting the heart of someone who has flatlined meaning that there's no heartbeat and then they get it back to beating again but this actually isn't how they work in actual fact differ abilities stop the heart from beating if it's beating up normally so they are racing revelation essentially and they're not used on a patient who's flatlining but if they are used on the patient let us stop learning then the patient will first be given a round of drugs such as epinephrine to jumpstart the heart into any kind of activity even just a tiny twitch which can then be shocked and then CPR is used to try and get it back to a normal rhythm so you do need CPR to get the heart going again once you've stopped it defibrillators are very common in medical dramas I'm sure you've all seen at least one scene where a patient has been brought back to life with one some medical dramas that are more unrealistic in general we'll use this technique on a flatlining patient while others such as or that seem to prefer to place accuracy over dramatic license volge yeah it's a medical drama but with the emphasis on drama rather than medicine I think far too bogged down in so-called research yeah the producer arranged for us to follow a team of paramedics around for a month but instinctively that felt wrong I mean a month yeah but of course you have shows like scrubs where it's just used for comedy and you know that they're not trying to be medically accurate and just want to make you laugh like in that episode where JT has his first code and Trek gets there first and Chuck's a slot laying patient who actually just had a faulty monitor and was just sleeping and [Music] then another one that's commonly seen on TV is the bear cable method now just in case I'm incapacitated for some reason do you know how to start a man's heart with a downed power line no well there's really no wrong way to do it so there's this episode of mr. bean where he uses jump leads to shock a man back to life and it works on too little but this method can actually sometimes be justified but generally it will actually just induce the need to be different related but it's not just action of the defibrillator that is kinda embellish for both the little on the big screen but a heart attack itself is also generally not portrayed the way it normally happens so someone is going along in their daily life just reading the newspaper when suddenly they have a shooting pain in their left arm and within seconds they stagger clutching at their chest when they drop like a stone to the floor unconscious and probably dead right but in real life heart attacks are not always like that and they can vary in their nature yes of course you can have an instantaneous death with chest clutching dramatics but you can also have it where someone doesn't even realize that they've had one until years and years later when an ECG discovers the damage left behind and of course a heart attack might not show up on an ECG at all which is why they do additional testing in the event of a negative ECG when there are symptoms of a heart attack because only a third of ECGs carried out actually detect heart attack has occurred and while some women do have chest pain some of the more common heart attack symptoms in women include things like nausea dizziness heartburn and feeling faint so heart attacks can really go completely unnoticed and don't always need a defibrillator and of course on the flip side you can think you're having a heart attack when you're not [Applause] and if you would like more medical you'll get $20 Amazon credit amazing so go check it out and if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you'd like to see more hit subscribe a big thank you to my patrons on patreon and thank you for watching right
