this video is sponsored by world warships yo welcome so you're probably wondering what's going on here so as you remember I built my first robot not too long to go whoa hold it right there present-tense Jabril your thoughts are not authorized I'll take it from here he'll guys so not too long ago Destin from the channel smart every day got together with some friends and decide to put on a little event with the purpose of connecting EDU creators and inviting any and all who wanted to come and with some awesome help from YouTube to make this happen the event became official announcing Pinker Khan remember several years ago five of us educational content creators got together and we did this live event it was really fun but people came from like 40 states in 12 different nations for it so clearly there's a lot of demand for this sort of thing we're gonna do something similar only much bigger there were five content creators at that event there's going to be 20 times that at what we're doing here and when I got my invite I immediately thought how cool would it be to create some mega featured video featuring a lot of the creators that you know and love and at the fact that some 3-4 months to think of an idea I was feeling quite good about this mega featured project idea fast forward to the day of my flight and I had the best idea on how I could explain to you guys on what happened see what happened was a little after I got the invite from Destin unity actually invited me to the LA conference I go to that learn how to make a our apps and well let's just say my schedule fill in the chaos after a our ideas invaded my brain so much so that even on the plane I was still experimenting with a are I ended up making this little personal YouTube room portal demo thingy during my nine-hour commute to thinker time so you forgive me right perfect moving on think ik on the event itself was a blast I got to meet and hang out with a lot of cool folk how some really rare conversations eat some really southern food and man I really hope YouTube's willing to help thinker con again for another one because it was quite the dream to come anywho it's now the final day of thinker con and I still did absolutely nothing video wise which when I travel I do my best to try and make some sort of video about it because I mean let's face the facts I spend so much time making YouTube videos that it's kind of like an archive in my life at this point but thankfully Jacqueline from the channel side Joe and I have been trying to do a collaboration together for a couple of years now and we finally had a date on the calendar which of course was last day of thinker gone aka today or at least for the context of this video and so all might think her conne roommates and I loaded into a vehicle and headed over to Jacqueline's workshop on wheels from hell seriously if you only seen the amount of maker equipment that she and Tim stuff into a little hotel room you'd be amazed [Music] [Applause] how'd you grill what's up it's better now before we continue in today's treats and jump into a few matches and now back to the episode with everything pretty much ready and waiting for my mark we start to record something but I had no idea what we started off with clearing up some of the things that I didn't fully understand when I made my first robot and jacqueline explained a lot of really interesting stuff like for instance if you have something like an LED that has two pins it's easy enough to grasp one pin is for ground and the other pin is for positive haven't used batteries all my life it's simple I get it but while looking at many things on my local makers Disneyland I came across things like this servo that has three pins or wires and so I asked Jaclyn about that yeah so you have power and grounds so that's how you get your voltage right and then you need signal because this is not an on and off it's somewhere in between I see so the signal is going to be your other one that's telling that word this is a servo so it turns right and then the signal is it controls essentially the power in which it will turn right so it's telling it how much to go watch the turn interesting interesting indeed so in a snare like this two wires still do as expected ground and positive but the last one is for the signal which tells a servo which angle it needs to be F hmm good to know moving forward but lobby lobby la fast for it's the part you all want to see here is when the idea came to fruition I think it's a it's a bit fitting we're here at think your cotton yeah and I feel like we're gonna have to say hello to a lot of people correct so I would love to use a servo or whatever the case might be to make a waving box okay yeah can we do that yeah yeah we have definitely and we have down in there in the arts and crafts we have either construction paper oh we also have where they call pipe cleaners so you can make like a little a little hand yo to wave to people yeah y'all ready some arts and crafts you're never too old for us to crash right oh let's let's do this all right we need some people to think you're gone that's what was my idea it's a bit too egotistical it's making Destin Destin well you have a blue can make a blue hat little no it's Destin yes it's a great point and so project build robot Destin was in full effect first we need to get familiar with the domain of our components which for the board we're using an Adafruit circuit playground express if you were curious and so we were on a very simple program of rotate to zero degrees and then to 180 degrees ran the program and wait to see what would happen hey Sakura we got a little secure action going on hey very seductive but not the desired effect we wanted so what do you think maybe it went wrong with this like I try to say the program is a checklist for the robot so if you're a robot reading this checklist as fast as you possibly can read this checklist what do you think what do you think they're doing not give enough time to get to the other angle right so you're just rude so you're trying to get back to the other one but you're already at 180 and then by the time you try and get to zero you're already told to go back to 180 so I think there's sleep or a wait yeah okay that makes sense so we put in some weight functions so I'm adding weight in there and then I'm going to just guess to me imma start we start i'd never number you want five seconds and I know I need another weight not have them don't either save it but they turned out to be the wrong weight functions the IDE we're using was make code by Microsoft and because it offered a few different types of weight functions we tried another one called timer that we believe made a bit more sense to use and come on there we go bazinga yeah there we go closer almost so so what we believed was happening at this point was that we were getting too close to the angle limits of the servo and so we made the rotation angle of bit more acute instead of trying to a full 180 we instead narrowed it down to 90 degrees and ran it again and we got it oh wait a second it's the tire functions a bit it turns out our second weight function timer wasn't the correct one either they kept doubling the wait time after every rotation or something like that and so we tried yet another weight function called pause there we go yes high fives all around yeah yeah and buzzing yeah yeah yeah it's what problem-solving is all about yeah cool so we got our we get er we got our Destin's hand without the extra hand it finally worked like for real this time now listen if you are familiar with programming this process is quite typical even if your 30 year programming veteran unless use the same library day in and day out you will need documentation to know the differences between things like sleep weight and pause because it's very likely that different libraries define them differently for the most part there is no real standard for this stuff so shouts in the team for debugging this with absolutely no documentation but now that we have the most important part figured out our robot is pretty much done all that's left now is arts and crafts cue montage [Music] hey Ali welcome to think [Music] [Music] and then we finally finished it now listen I don't know what you're thinking how did you guys get a hold of such advanced cloning technology calm down calm down I promise you it is for sure a robot now all that's left is to go over I'll think you're gone introducing everyone to this exact replica destined let the good times begin [Music] and then we actually ran into the other Destin and boy was in trouble we got confused on which was the real Destin and which one was the robot if we almost accidentally took the real Destin with this back to the hotel but yeah that was pretty much the story on how we turned to youtube creator into a robot following this the event was a great time had some nice chats I was on the panel with some cool folks watch the fireworks finale then the next day I was on my flight headed home back to San Diego not gonna lie I was quite sad that the trip was over but I was quite happy to have a video to edit and share with you guys yeah I'm Destin and you should totally subscribe to generals channel because that something Destin would say totally and I am in no way a rope alright guys that's all from me for this week but before we go a couple of things be sure to go check out my buddy Jacqueline's channel she has all types of Robotics DIYs and they bunch of other cool engineering content link to her channel is in the description also to warships again link is at the top of the description now it's begging time if you haven't already please subscribe and hit that Bell icon it helps out a lot more than you know and real quick I hear a lot of people talking about how YouTube doesn't show my videos to them well quick tip YouTube shows you videos in three different ways the Home tab the trending tab and the subscription tab if you try and find me on the training your home tab my video likely will not be there but as it's been communicated to me it should always be on your subscription tab if you check it but anywho please come follow me on Twitter and Instagram add your own underscore is my handle and it's a great time I promise and if you want to support my work beyond youtube please consider becoming a patron on patreon for patronage and shout out to these top of thrones for their support alright I hope to see you all next week but whatever the case may be remember to always feed it curiosity [Music]
