a second streaming platform that I am a part of more on that later warning this video is full of miss pronunciations of the names of both characters and places in the Marvel Comics universe specifically relating to Thor so yes I'll see you guys in the comments other than that let's do this at this point it doesn't even feel fair to say anymore like beating a dead korbinite but Thor the dark world is not great it is always brought up as the example of a mech Marvel movie and the least great part of the dark world is almost certainly this guy Malekith he is so least great that the only thing that he is consistently great at is being at the top of those worst comic book movie villain lists even though I think you could make a much stronger case for the other emotionless white-haired alien who wants to steal the magic space force particle effect that has been possessing the heroine since the first act one day Dark Phoenix I will get to you and boy is it a shame Christopher Eccleston is a solid actor now I've never seen Doctor Who I know I know I know but I've seen the leftovers I've seen 28 days later gone in 60 seconds and even the GI Joe movie where they all wear Iron Man suits and he is clearly more than capable of knocking a world like Malekith out of the park and in the comics Malekith is an exciting character he has a fun look he does cool magic he's a psychopath he's clever and best of all he's sassy if you don't believe me check out the recent war of the realms event by Jason Aaron Malekith organizes an army of pretty much every Thor villain and almost takes over the nine realms unfortunately Thor the dark world stripped away almost everything that makes Malekith special and left us with the blankest of slates he has no personality no superpowers and I kind of understand why on paper a Thor villain who uses magic and theatricality to take over the nine realms sounds a lot like Loki who at this point in history has been the villain in two out of seven Marvel movies even his look Malachi's traditionally has a half black and half blue face but they took the blue away and replaced it with white which I can't help but imagine has something to do with the fact that in these movies Loki has naturally blue skin since he's actually a frost giant so Malekith is boring and whenever he is a part of the movie it suffers which is a shame because there is a lot about dark world that really works besides the score and the costume design I think the highlight of dark world is clearly Thor and Loki relationship when they are on-screen together the dark world is awesome the humor the drama their chemistry is terrific and the movie needed more of it so if I could make one small change to Thor the dark world it would be this Malekith should be way more like the version of the character from the comics and I know that sounds like a no brainer but I'm gonna explain why I think a more comic accurate Malekith would make the dark world a more successful movie and give you an idea of what this new version of dark world would look like and I realize that the dark world is an incredibly forgettable movie it is so forgettable that when they needed to reference it in endgame the writers added a scene where Thor ran through the plot real quick so that everyone was on board and even though we all saw endgame I still don't expect everyone to remember the plot of this movie so before I get moving I'm gonna give you a quick recap of everything that happens in Thor 2 up to the point where I really want to make changes okay Thor's fighting wars all over the nine realms he wins a battle on vanaheim mrs. Jane and then Jane finds the Phoenix force I mean aether door saves Jane and brings her to Asgard then we learn about the aether it's a reality bending space force that back-in-the-day Malekith tried to use to cover the nine realms in darkness and now that jane has the Phoenix force Odin is oops ether Odin is worried that Malekith will return for it this is especially a problem in my new version because I want to make one tiny change Heimdall cannot track the Dark Elves he has the power to see every soul in the galaxy with the exception of a few species like Celestials and Titans and Dark Elves have it be because their souls are shrouded in darkness or something Thor the dark world kind of does this but I'm going to exploit that role in the future so it needs to be stated clearly early on the Asgardian scientists attempt to get the aether out of Jane and failed then Malekith attacks destroys Asgard kills Frigga everyone has said very serious funeral lovely score and then Thor node and argue over what to do with Malekith Thor wants to track Malekith down and stop him before he can attack Asgard again so Thor assembles a team of Fandral Volstagg and SIF Hogan is absent from this movie apparently he's on vanaheim I don't know if it's like an actor scheduled thing but he's not really part of it Thor is also bringing Jane Heimdall is going to cause a distraction and since Heimdall can't open the Bifrost the team needs to find another way to travel to fartole Heim the realm of the Dark Elves which is where Loki comes in he is recruited to help the team get too far too high with the promise of getting revenge on the guy that killed his mom so Thor Jane and Loki traveled to Sparta han they come up with a plan now here's where the change comes in this time the plan is a little different Loki is going to hide Jane and Thor is going to attempt to kill Malekith himself I think the false betrayal plan that the actual movie does isn't terrible but I found it a little transparent I think this version of the movie is more interesting for reasons we'll get to later so here's the scene Malekith his bodyguard curse and the rest of the Dark Elves are getting their ship ready for another raid on Asgard Thor sneaks up and throws me all near at Malekith at the last second milner goes through a portal and disappears so that's another change I want to make to Malekith I want this version of Malekith to be able to do magic and I want a lot of his magic to be portal teleporting things from one space to another in the beginning of the movie he can only do it over like short distances within the same realm but maybe at the end of the movie if Malekith gets control of the aether he can extend that power and teleport things between realms so me only err disappears Malick turns around Oh sorr what have you done with your hammer I sent it somewhere on this world I know not where but far away surrender Malekith where's your army I came alone and you left a girl behind not likely which means she is here and hidden which means Malekith smiles Loki enough Malekith surrender now I can bring her back what your mother this power I can wield to reshape reality and I can use it to bring your mother back to life you killed her yes well she was a casualty of war and she died bravely I mean to destroy as gods so that I can conquer the nine realms but if you give me the aether now I will restore Frigg as life and let you live on Midgard in peace liar I swear it Loki save your mother like you could not before Loki don't listen to him he's trying to trick you then Loki appears I'm sorry brother No then curse knocks Thor out and you will leave the girl unharmed she means nothing to me so yes once I removed the aether she will be safe Loki uses a spell to put Jane asleep and takes Jane down to Malekith curse let's Loki through Malekith removes the aether from Jane Loki picks up an unconscious Jane and takes her on to malakut ship Malekith orders curse to stay with thor don't kill him that wasn't part of the deal I understand I'm sorry brother then Malekith Loki Jane and the remaining Dark Elves leave that's my big change to Malekith in the dark world Malekith is this emotionless robotic guy there isn't much to him and that can work in specific circumstances comic Malekith has a lot more personality and that makes him an interesting foil to Loki clever egotistical theatrical manipulative this Malekith is pure evil because unlike Loki Malekith has no Thor or Frigga to ground him in his humanity air quotes Malekith should recognize that and use it against Loki so then Thor and curse fight the fight is mostly Thor trying to take hits from curse until he is able to summon male near and discursive right about to land the final punch on Thor me only er flies in at the speed of a missile and kills curse then Fandral SIF and Volstagg Bifrost in and rescue Thor they take him back to Asgard where he talks with Odin and Heimdall you fool you've doomed Asgard and the rest of the nine realms I told you not to pursue Malekith now he has the aether and we no idea how to find it he will be free to use its power to cover the universe and darkness I'm sorry father but Thor has a realization Heimdall you cannot see the Dark Elves that's right their souls are beyond my senses but a human travelling with the Dark Elves perhaps try to find Jane she is in Malekith ship if you find her we can figure out where Malekith is going then Fandral says do you think this was all part of Loki's plan I have spent my entire life with Loki and even I have no idea and the last thing I want to change about the movie is how the final fight plays out I understand what they were going for but I think it ends up feeling very messy the humans are just running away from Dark Elves and Thor is just bouncing around with Malekith I think the idea of them falling through portals in the general chaos associated with the fight is interesting but it also makes this very difficult to track there are no real objectives the fight just happens for eleven minutes until it ends so now in this instance I am going to call on something I never have before called mega ultra high a lot of the times I get comments saying well it's a lot easier to do with hindsight I completely agree what I'm doing is a lot easier than writing the script tooth or two before you know which parts of it are and are not going to work however I'm going to use hindsight so hindsight ii that i am going to draw things from a comic that wasn't even kind of out when this movie takes place because i want the final fight to be a mini war of the realms because i don't think it's very much fun to have another fight where a team of good guys fights a faceless army so instead Malekith opens up the aether thor shows up and tells Malekith to stop doing what he's doing and Malekith he uses the power of the aether to extend his powers to create portals and he brings in some monsters from other realms so he's gonna bring in one of those frost beasts from thor one that actually makes an appearance in this movie let's have him also bring in one of those fire dragons from the beginning of Ragnarok maybe not that big of one but something similar and then maybe something like a rock troll which is another race that exists in the nine realms if you're familiar with the character Olek he is the leader of the rock trolls but in this situation just one big troll made out of rocks kind of like a smaller version of the rock Titan from Hercules or The Rock Monster things from the first Hobbit movie and Malekith is going to use those to defend himself along with his army of Dark Elves which at this point there's like 20 of them left and then Thor staring down these monsters says aren't you going to ask where my army is and then the rest of the Asgardians Bifrost it so the Asgardian warriors and Odin we're going to give out in and fight scene one that's not in a flashback give him an opportunity to be cool so then we'll have Malekith figure out what happened Loki Loki poorly feigning ignorance Malekith whoops thor hits Malekith with some lightning Loki has Jane in his arms and they are running back to Thor Jane wakes up slaps Loki again Loki says I still deserve that but we have a job to do and this is what we're going to do the good guys are going to break apart into four teams each of the first three teams is going to have one or two humans and one Asgardian so Jane is going to go with SIF Selvig is going to go with Volstagg love a little joke where Selvig says oh it's full stag the voluminous and Volstagg could say it's only Volstagg and Darcy and the intern go with Fandral the cute one Darcy can swoon over fan troll which will make it fun when the intern saves her and each of those teams is going to take one of these convergence inhibitor pole thingies and plant it in a specific place so that they can close the convergence and each team is going to be pursued by one of the monsters that Malekith summoned so everything's gonna go the right way he has guardians with some help from the humans are going to kill their monsters or send them back through the portals or whatever and the portals are going to close and then the final team of Thor Odin and Loki are going to fight the remaining Dark Elves and Malekith this will include a showdown between Odin and Malekith which will be really fun Malekith will get some shots in but Odin will eventually kill him and then Thor and Loki will have to stop the aether which has grown out of control and if not stopped will destroy Midgard earth our realm and at that moment Hogan is going to Bifrost in with that container that they used to hold the aether at the end of the movie while the fight was going on Heimdall sent Ogun to nineveh leer so that Eitri could make that container and this is just to facilitate hogan being a part of this if this actor can't film every fight scene so Thor Loki tried to contain the aether from the outside but it doesn't work someone is going to need to go inside to contain the aether which will probably kill them Thor tells Loki I'm going to go inside and stop it Loki says but you'll be killed yes but it must be done then Loki says I'm sorry brother holds Thor's hands and then handcuffs or the same way that Thor handcuffs Loki during the escape you know I like tricks and then Loki is going to use frost giant powers to freeze Thor's feet to the ground Thor I'll plead with Loki but it won't work and then Thor will say I'll tell father what you did and right before Loki steps into the aether he will say I didn't do it for him then Loki is going to step into the aether he is going to use the containment device to contain the aether and he is going to disappear and that's going to bring his arc full circle originally he was going to do more or less what Malekith was going to do but now Loki knows better Frigga and Thor have taught him about selflessness and sacrifice and if Loki sacrifices himself to stop the aether he is defeating Malekith the figurative worst version of himself Loki is redeemed and if Loki disappears into the aether it isn't crazy that he comes back because nobody knows what the reality bending aether will do to him kind of the same way Red Skull is air quotes killed in the First Avenger but then he shows up again in infinity war it's like well we didn't see what happened to him so maybe he died or maybe he didn't who knows and if Loki goes into the aether we can save maybe he rewrote reality and that's how he became king in Odin's place and that can facilitate what is without a doubt the most important change of this movie in Thor to Loki sacrifices himself but it's all just a fake out there is what seems to be growth but in the end it's not really genuine Loki didn't sacrifice himself he was ok but this sacrifice actually happened loki was actually willing to die to save everybody he just happened to also survive so it makes his sacrifice way more meaningful so that's the change a more comic accurate Malekith would make a great foil for the loki in Thor the dark world he would show what Loki could have become but because of the love of his family Loki was able to grow and become more than Malekith oh and one more thing if of your subscription for free it's
