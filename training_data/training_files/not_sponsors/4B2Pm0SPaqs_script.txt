meet swamp lennox my mauritania locked ultimate iron man welcome to my home I've spent over 2,500 hours in one region of the game overcoming obstacles want to go for full guns hear me out [Music] so with that chest I am now 92 chest dry of a barrows item in other words a little over six times the drop rate if I hit a hundred chest dry I'm just gonna end it there I'm just gonna take that as a sign nothin's doesn't exist [Music] I really never expected to end an episode by going a hundred barrels chest dry but at this point I just want to see how dry we could go let's find out 1275 Oh did not last long so I went exactly a hundred chests Wow well I'm very interested to see how things go from here 1275 chests count still missing two pieces my target is going to be two thousand chests which is going to be another 250 hours of barrows hopefully I can get my guns chest plate and chain skirt by then if not I have a plan - why l've 80 nothing the amount of times I am too stubborn to teleport out on one HP and then by some miracle make it to that chest is is crazy safe and sound not even close guys [Music] thirteen-hundred chest down I am really wondering how far this is gonna go I recently checked the high scores for Ultimates I need a little over two thousand chests to be in the top 25 so I think I'm gonna go for 90 range here I'm 300k away I just hit 1300 chest so I feel like it's a good time for a small break that's gonna put me at base ninety combat stats excluding magic of course but I have some might get that at this point and gorgeous about to go to bed 90 range done look at those stats look at him look at him so nice back to barrows we go gonna try to hit 1,500 chest before I take any kind of break like this again 1320 nothing 1325 yes guys the flail of ancient warrior ver acted to fun lucky I'm playing yeah just 1337 nothing 88 magic oh we're getting close to 90 base you know on the bright side once I do hit 90 magic my max hit with Slayer dart bumps up to 19 which is the max so I can do my next 18,000 bears chest like 2% faster which is gonna be pretty sweet but otherwise like having 90 it's actually going to be really sick having all 90 combat stats this is it I feel it okay wrong feeling it has to be like my ninth one man I'm gonna have double-digit farik Helms soon incredible absolutely incredible this is where I got the rune crossbow so has to be something good has to be something good black battle axe [Music] just 1381 whoa whoa whoa guys guys guys hear me out swamp wizard guys swamp wizard I honestly really like it I can wear it while I'm not tanking +60 magic attack that is such a huge difference Wow I mean it's not gonna make like a massive difference in the actual thing because well magic attack is just isn't that important in Paros but from minus 43 to plus 60 Wow $13.99 I haven't seen that one in a very long time Wow well I'll take some variety any day all right there's chests 1400 1400 chests man if you've told me two months ago that I'd be 1,400 barrows chests with only two guns pieces I tell you you're insane all right how do we go to keep on pushing [Music] [Music] got a good feeling get a good feeling it's all good oh oh no not gonna talk about it not gonna say a word everything's fine item on this chest you filthy liar tore eggs ham there's an item it's been a little while at this point the goal is no longer guff ins you know don't be mistaken it is seeing how disgustingly dry I can go for guns and how many duplicate items I can fit into this collection lock that's the only way this works and here's 1450 almost at 1500 chests [Music] 1475 chests have been completed stinky stinky stinky Touareg plate legs whoo that and say what like almost 50 chests dry streak I think I will take it I'm not happy about it but I will take it that is pair number six by the way some rubies would definitely lift my spirits not gonna lie ah yay 636 bolt tips now 1494 nothing good good luck guffin piece I'm about 1,500 chests look at my death runes how do I let this happen I used to have 10,000 how did I let it drain without replenishing I just I stopped getting kill cow and I was like oh I'll be fine I can do faster chests like this and now I'm like almost out oh boy I gotta get on that well didn't expect to be saying this but uh 1500 chest complete without a third gun things beasts wild the world Wow and here's the log at 1500 chests I am an Arabs hood and top away from having three of every barrows item except the two I want boom Aram's hood what the heck I was literally just talking about this yesterday uh yeah I now have three Arabs hoods need one top to have three of every item whoa that happened really quickly 89 magic just a friendly reminder my original goal was 79 and I'm about to have 90 magic in a couple hundred more runs as soon as I hit 90 I'll switch to the defensive casting that way maybe I can get both 99 magic and defense by the time I get these two pieces so 1545 Derek's great axe I decided to log back in and do one more run before I went to sleep and I got an axe cool well good night chest 1554 some mind runes 50 more until 1600 boom another win for Carole's crossbow gang This Is It this is it this is it Oh what for all you curious folk out there that's my fourth pair of Tory hammers 1571 another skirt very expensive item let's check the log real quick that is my fourth Arum skirt [Music] yo Aram's staphon 1597 and that is my fifth Aaron's staff well unless I get a guns piece on this chest no okay it wasn't really expecting that another 100 chest milestone without the plate or skirt definitely starting to feel a bit demoralized why does this sleepwalker have an arrow above its head I'm so I've teleported to this location like a million in seven times I've never seen this is he leading me to the guns this word is Jagex this is a clue oh that is another crossbow number eight I believe and an elite clue which they actually can do but I probably won't do the second step 16:21 very cool Aaron's staff number six 16:29 Wu 1644 tor eggs plate body all right 1650 oh my god oh my [ __ ] god oh my god yes oh my god a third piece it's finally happened it's felt like 1,400 chests and so I got a unique Gunter's piece oh my god it's been more than that it's but 1,500 guff ins chains cart oh my god I'm missing one piece I'm missing one piece yes I am in such utter disbelief that this actually happened it's it's insane to me I got two pieces of the set in the first couple days of the grind and then it took two months to get my third piece that's what I mean though just a minute takes a minute for your luck to turn around let's get this final piece and complete barrows for good alright Gulf ins plate body back to back oh my god can you imagine I had such a weird fee that I'd get it there somehow I would have been incredible oh my god 16:52 what what no no oh my god no there's no way holy [ __ ] I'm done oh my god I'm done on a double chest as well that was so close to back-to-back no way no way what just happened I'm done I could leave oh my god oh it's lagging so bad to just support [ __ ] chests apart I even oh my god I was feeling a back to back it was so close to a back to back I can't believe my head is spinning my my head is actually getting kind of dizzy right now what just happened and in a double chest of all scenarios of all scenarios it's in a double chest with an errand skirt that's so lucky look at this monstrous figure look am I completely filled to the brim inventory oh my goodness I'm sorry I'm freaking out so bad barrels log is complete it's green it's green 25 out of 25 all right all right all right let's calm down let's calm down and restore my stats heal up take a breather guff ins is finished it's gonna take me a while to get over this I love it I love it first thing on the list here has to be to clear my inventory of it I can't work with this this is too much let's start by getting rid of any barrows pieces I don't need like the the Aram's swamp wizard is no more but I'm sorry like I need the space so badly right now so [Music] all right there we go inventory is looking a lot more manageable now I think the next thing has to be magic I know okay 90 magic is useless but I'll be damned if I let 89 be the final magic level I get on this account I'm 150 K away I have so many runes I want to finish off 90 magic and I have all the combat stats be 90 Plus this really won't take that long maybe a day gonna start with some Slayer dart on experiments and then I'll have to get an air staff to use my chaos runes well that was quick that's the last of them so these level 50 zombies drop look at that heal these guys dropping their staff should take me no more than an hour to get one there it is beautiful so I've been splashing my chaos runes around pretty much all day such a relaxing peaceful activity after doing barrows for so long and I'm I'm glad I committed to this because 90 magic is done boom look at that that is going to be the final magic level I ever get on this account all of my combat stats are now 90 plus including magic which I never thought would happen I don't really have any use for a 21 mil worth of chaos runes so I'll be dropping those on the floor for my other account to pick up the blood runes on the other hand I actually need for the theater for nigh locus so that's why I went heavy into stockpiling those during barrows one item left in operation inventory clear and that's the mithril arrows I made these a long time ago during the fletching grind and now I'm gonna clear them from my inventory here's the plan I'm gonna use the rest of my bolt racks to kill swamp crabs and swamp crabs not only give range xp but they also drop willow logs so I can get a willow log drop and craft myself a willow short bow and start using the arrows there we go will the logs acquired oh how I didn't miss this I have to do one temple Trek in order to get myself some bowstring and let's craft the short bow there we go short bow made from scratch let's go use some arrows I've waited a long time for this from Slayer to hunter to crafting to smithing to fletching one final skilling grind remains 55 or blurr the requirement to make super strength potions that's what I need thankfully during all of these grinds I've managed to use my Genie lamps and books of knowledge to get over 60,000 herblore XP pushing me from 41 to nearly 50 this is by far the most brutal skill to train in mauritania and it's why I left it for last it's highly reliant on inventory space it's tedious it's slow but it's time to knock it out for good and never touch another skilling grind again in the past I trained herb Laura through temple trekking I'd gather herbs in bulk clear out space and then use them slowly but as we know temple trekking is a dangerous minigame and dying in it now would be such a devastating setback that I don't want to risk it the plan is simple make enough serum 207 to cure every villager in Morton a hundred times over we're gonna save Morton everybody even though they just keep getting infected anyway but that's not the point I'm gonna collect Airman's from chaos roots and I already planned this out in advance last episode by paying one mill for the free boat shortcuts I think it's a fantastic unlock I've already thought of how I'm going to use it because it gives me a very easy way to get from the chaos druid tower close to a tool leprechaun where I'd be able to note my herbs if you catch my drift I expect this to take twice as long as getting the herbs from temple trekking but I do it with no risk I need to make approximately 1353 serum 207 s to get 55 herb-lore which would take approximately a thousand three hundred and fifty three Terrans but instead I'm gonna try to get around 300 Terrans and go for a respectable 300% return on my investment it's all assumption at the moment but I'm hoping that I can get three Terrans back from the villager reward system for each one that I use [Music] I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone here and at least get started on my mithril arrows by killing some druids collecting some Terrans and getting some range XP 350 k XP until 91 these arrows should very easily get me that I feel and there we go full inventory technically let's go get these noted [Music] all right there we go noted and I got some Aven toast as well just to test out how effective making super energy potions is cuz I can get fungi pretty easily all right let's make this defense potion really quick it's kind of cheap because I was already pretty close to this level the rest of them are gonna take way longer but big one out of the way 50 herblore oh that's a good sample size 60 and 26 just so I can test the waters and see how many herbs I'm gonna need for the full grind now the most important thing is to get that one extra inventory space and get rid of these arrows so that I can drop the willow shortbow 91 range hell yeah man I believe that gives me another max hit with the crossbow ten thousand arrows left should make some decent progress towards 90 - yeah I got them and we are all out of arrows my friends all gone which means we can now drop the willow short bow and have maximum inventory space [Music] oh my god I'm so bad at this game well the day of herb-lore reckoning has arrived so every single trip I'm going to cut down seven logs and then I'm going to burn seven logs while I wait about a minute for those logs to burn and then pick up the ashes from them I'm gonna use my tear mints to make unfinished serum 207 s then we collect the ashes from the logs and bada-bing bada-boom that's the herblore method it is painfully painfully slow but it does work Morton here savior has arrived and he's got seven inventory slots so please be patient thank you sir this is very appreciated so I only got two from using seven there which I feel is a bit unlucky let's give it some more tests that's what I'm talking about look at the floor I'm suffering from success too many things to hold on to and if we put the ashes in the thingy 51 or Bloor beautiful four levels to go I've used pretty much all sixty tournaments so I'm gonna go do some calculations in a second here and come up with how many I need in order to finish 55 just got four rubies from the evil twin random event awesome I've got a new goal as well I'm gonna go for 300 tournaments on the dot and that's assuming I get a one two three return on each one that I use second day of tournament collection and we are one third of the way there 100 terram is noted boom the big ninety-six that's one of the original melee stat goals I set myself 96 attack is done gonna keep training it obviously but seek to have a ninety six out of the way already 205 Terra means noted 1k away from 52 herblore and 253 noted herbs this is gonna be 280 even boom three trips to go much much shorter day 800 slain today topping it off to 300 with three more Terrans took pretty much three days to collect all 300 herbs and that unfortunately was the easy part I'm already 400 XP away from 52 just from cleaning and random potions I've made and a quick level 52 air blower three more levels to go it's been a full day since I got those 300 Terra mins and we're already at 53 mega no mistake I'm putting in some pretty sweaty hours to finish this up to make hunter potions now and we are 14k away until 54 herblore see you in seven hours I did a full hour just to test out the rates paused all the timers and yeah about 2k an hour is what I can get so we're looking at about what 16 17 hours until 55 not bad and boom 54 herblore I can now clean chorim's which is indeed the herb required to make strength potions super strength potions one more one more level until I never have to skill again on this account completely finished let's do this you guys are looking at the final burning flames on 280 XP Oh a as soon as these fires die out there you go we've got one set of ashes and we've got another set of ashes the final set of ashes it is done right here right now I have every skilling stat required to take on the theatre of blood I can now make super strength potions baby it's done all skilling stats are done took about a full week starting from 50 or blurr to get 55 to kxp an hour once I had all the herbs noted and I think it worked out to be like 60 hours for the full thing definitely one of the lighter grinds but it was one that I was dreading for for a while the last two weeks have been insane for this account finishing a two month long quest for this guffin set and then knocking out the final skilling stat I will ever need for anything in this region leaving me with just my combat stats that needs some polishing and one piece of unfinished business but I'll get to that you can really feel how close the final challenge is thank you for watching [Music]
