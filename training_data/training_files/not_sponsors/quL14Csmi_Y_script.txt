- [Dan] Wear safety goggles during use. - What does ANSI-approved mean? - [Dan] I don't know. - Do these count? - [Dan] That looks,
that looks about right. Mount securely before use. Yeah, it looks good. And inspect before every
use. Discard if chipped. Look good? - Looks good to me. - [Dan] I think we're ready. (Pumpkin smashes) (Anvil lands) (Gravel moves) So for some reason, we've
got a lot of requests to do an anvil, which we always thought would be kind of boring, until
we got a slow-motion camera. Inspect it. - No chips. - [Dan] 'Kay. Looks like
we can still use it. (Anvil impacts stone) (Muffled laugh) (Anvil impacts stone) - [Dan] Did we pick a good one? - Yeah. It's real
watermelon, and real good. - Next up, one dozen eggs. - [Mitchell] Do you
wanna hide behind this? (Anvil lands on stone) (Eggs break, anvil hits stone) - [Dan] The inspection. - No chips. I think we're
good for one more throw. - [Dan] Last one. Two-liter bottle of Coke. (Anvil hits stone) (laughs) (Anvil hits stone) - [Dan] Well, that worked
out better than I thought, and I think you finally redeemed yourself from throwing that rock-batarang. - I missed! (Dan laughs) - Maybe not quite, but... (Dan laughs) - I think we got a few little chips here. - [Dan] Ooh. Better safe than sorry. - [Mitchell] Probably dispose of it. - [Dan] Yeah, we should
probably get rid of this. (ambient music) - And what is inside a metal anvil? - [Dan] More anvil? - More metal. (Dan laughs) - Wait! Wait for it! - [Dan] What is that? - It's like a a Bondo, a void in the cast iron, and they tried to pull one over on us. Not today my friends. (hammer hits) Whole thing, just Bondo. - [Dan] Full of lies.
