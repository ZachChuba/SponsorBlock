you know what has gone on gamers in welcome back to the channel hey in this video we're gonna be talking about apex legends in the new season season 5 that just recently dropped this season brought a number of great changes and the roster of Champions continues to grow giving you lots of options for finding the way to play apex that you really jive with now before we dive into cross swords in game one day all right back to apex first off this video contains both PC and ps4 gameplay and I am definitely a an unapologetic caustic mane and a lot of people meme caustically these more like a camping character at camp in your building put it traps that's not really the way that I play caustic and a lot of the really good caustics out there don't play them that way I love pushing buildings and Pio is as caustic and smoking people out if you're wondering if season 5 is worth your time by the way let me remind you that apex Legends is free-to-play you literally have nothing to lose just firing it up and checking it out you won't have access to all the champions unless you either pay to unlock them or play enough to get enough in-game currency to unlock them manually but for free you'll have access to several different champions that are plenty relevant in the current sandbox you won't be at a loss not having access to some of the characters season 5 brings some changes to the original map Kings Canyon skull town one of my personal favorite drop locations is a thing of the past as it has now sank into the ocean along with Thunderdome there's a massive hole and a new smaller Pio I in its place just outside of market now the labs area has continued to evolve as well and there are a number of decent smaller places of interest scattered about the map now in contrast to the original design of Kings Canyon if you're playing the standard trios and duo's playlist you'll be hopping back and forth during your play session from Kings Canyon and the newer map world's edge to keep your experience fresh something old something new so on and so forth the next major change this season is the arrival of a new champion named lobha she's the first sort of femme fatale champion to grace the roster in Apex she gives off major like spy movie love interest vibes as a sort of moral gray woman who's independent and strong can handle herself in a fight her whole identity is wrapped up in her being a renowned thief and all her abilities play to that role her passive ability lets her see items of purple and gold rarity through walls so she knows which buildings and which canisters to run to first it's really strong early game and they're trying to get your initial kit together or if you're looking for hop ups and things like that she also has a jump drive bracelet that she can toss onto buildings into buildings behind cover and teleport to it on command and her ultimate ability is a black market that she sets up and lets you pull items from any death box or canister or on the ground straight to your market without having to go running around and sifting through everything in the area she's certainly an interesting and versatile champion to play and certainly interesting to play against as well and definitely a welcomed addition to the already impressive roster of champions another fun addition to Apex this season is a series of PvE quests that you have to do at the bidding of loba she's sending you on a series of missions to help her with her mysterious goals and settle her scores I won't spoil any of that for you if you're looking to dive into it but know that it's a nice distraction to keep yourself busy another great feature in apex is the reconnect feature if your game crashes or you lose connection momentarily you can relaunch the game and load right back into your match assuming you haven't you know like died outside the zone yet or anything but your teammates can can always toss some heals at your feet and move forward and usually you get back in quickly enough to pick up where you left off no problem if you're a console gamer disconnects do happen a little more frequently I've noticed maybe once every two or so hours of gameplay from my experience although the most recent update I think may have helped alleviate some of that and next up we have the battle pass if you want to drop some cash on the battle pass and invest in the season then there are a number of unlocks for you including crafting metals so you can manually unlock things for the characters you play instead of just crossing your fingers with lube boxes and if you're not sure about the Battle pass you can always just play for a bit and see if this season is for you all your experience will backtrack so you can grab the battle pass and jump forward to whatever level you would have been if you'd picked it up right off the RIP so there's really nothing lost by waiting it out a bit all of that said I personally have really enjoyed getting back into apex this season after having taken the the last few seasons off it's been a great change of pace for me to log on with the guys and snag some wins and some laughs and perhaps the best feature of apex is the speed of the game you barely spend any time in the lobby matchmaking is fast fast fast load times are fast fast fast your boots are on the ground really fast and you're constantly engaged with the game and I absolutely love that another may be more approachable feature for some of the people coming back to apex or are new to apex it's all skill based matchmaking so if you are just new to the game where you're just coming back after a long break don't sweat it you're not gonna be thrust into these lobbies where you have to play you know level 300 players you're probably gonna see people who are relatively new to the game to casual players and if you get really into the game we start to get a good groove for it it's gonna just progressively move you into a different sort of skill bracket as you match me and the good thing about it is skill based matchmaking works a lot better when your population is enormous and this games population is enormous so there's not a lot of outliers in the lobby that don't really match the criteria and shouldn't be matching with you it's it does a really good job of keeping it pretty fair and balanced because it has such a huge player pool to pull from to make sure that your Lobby is pretty close to your skill level so maybe that'll encourage you to dive into season 5 well I hope that you have enjoyed my hot take and a quick synopsis of what this season has to offer and hopefully enjoy the gameplay as well and I think we had a couple more plays here I might let's just let it roll out a little bit so you can see a couple of nice little team wipes and whatnot thanks for watching I appreciate y'all and I look forward to catching you out there on the battlefield but bye get out get out just get out you got quiet for a second that we also focus bro I've got 10 kills Jay all right I have no I have no heel I'm gonna die here yeah you're the best in the game I said does it seem over here look a hospital you only have blue I broke his armor over there yeah cha-cha will get you know really bad there you go [Music] [Music]
