20:20 is looking to be a year for big-budget space games whether it is too few of them coming from very high-profile development studios dismiss game genre then is in a great place however that said many of these titles are existing games that are going to be receiving updates throughout the year and of course they're also numerous indie space games due for release and for those titles do keep an eye out for my upcoming in the space game video for a look of the upcoming and updated space games of 2020 then let's get to air years in the make in and with a budget of over 22 million dollars Jul universe is certainly continuing to generate a lot of interest with both the be term full release currently scheduled for 2020 dual universe could potentially be one of the biggest space games of the year and yes it's very literally aiming to be a huge space game this multiplayer titled is set on a single shared server which the developer claims could potentially hold millions of players with huge numbers of players being the goal then it makes sense that dual universe has a player driven content at its heart from player crated spaceships and buildings to plant driven economics and politics it really is all there is risk to be sure but if it works in the payoff could be exceptional after all my EVE Online has proven that player driven space games can certainly work and that they can hold hub for decades at a time and with the ability to seamlessly travel between the fully rendered atmospheric planets young universe will certainly offer a compelling game world the game has been in alpha access for quite a while now and is covered by a very tight NDA so it's certainly not easy to get a peek at the current state of play with the game however the developers release of regulative Diaries and information updates also the upcoming beta will dropped the NDA and then offer a far better insight into what's going on with the game now if you inter built-in in the space in any form whatsoever and enjoy it player driven politics your universe is highly likely to be a title you should keep your eye on star citizen is not a fully released game however a number of titles in this video fall into the early access camp so I felt it only fair to also include the alpha release of the long-awaited star citizen the recent citizen Khan highlighted the direction the game is heading in and showed off dynamic and persistent economy simulation and NPCs it also revealed the first jump point and the second star system and Brust there's no date on when these things will be in the game the star system roadmap does show a number of new features scheduled to arrive in 2020 this includes major new landing zones the implementation of the fully realized gas giant crusader in addition to the multiple landable modes of the planets micro tech at a Namek mission system is gieux in the first quarter of 2020 year along with expanded multi crew in the salvage gameplay further into the year naturally new ships and vehicles are also scheduled for release throughout the year despite the ongoing controversy around the game it continues to make steady progress with regular improvements and up days let's see then where star citizen is that at the end of 2020 released on PC this year rebel Galaxy outlaw is a fantastic space game that is true to the genres roads have been inspired by freelancer and other titles from yesteryear rebel Galaxy outlaw brings the modern age to those titles in 2020 rebel galaxy will be coming to both the PlayStation 4 as well as the switch mom especially personally looking forward to having an open-world space game on Nintendo's portable console stepping into the shoes of protagonist Juno the player has the freedom to explore the rebel galaxy universe as they see fit multiple star systems and a multitude of space stations players can fight trade mine and explore their way across the game world the game also features a fairly lengthy campaign not to mention one of the most comprehensive soundtracks from any game in recent years those of you then are looking for a fully featured complete space game experience on the switch pebble galaxy outlaw is gonna be great another build everything titled Starbase is due to into early access in 2020 and allow players to build everything from small spaceships to vast fully functional space stations the economy will be plan driven with players gaining the ability to create and join factions which will ultimately lead to ongoing and ever changing power structures across the game world taking on the form of the robot body players will be free to fight explore and build in pretty much any way they desire the entire concept of Starbase 10 appears to offer players as much freedom as possible in their choices of how they want to approach the game developers frozen by now already released a ton of information on the game and release regular videos and dev Diaries on the title the games discord server is among the most friendly and active of all space games so do be sure to check it out if you have any interest at all in the game one thing's for sure Starbase is certainly among the more ambitious space game titles and should turn into a very interesting game elite dangerous is among a few titles in this list where we don't really know exactly what is coming during the year we do know however that elite is scheduled to receive two major updates the first is D long-awaited a fleet carriers 10th of Li scheduled for around the middle of the year and this will feature huge capital class size ships which players will be able to own and move around the galaxy or will in true frontier tradition now the specifics are currently sparse but it will be possible to dock your regular ships with these super sized vessels and it's widely expected the fleet carriers will be able to be used as mobile bases of operations the second update front acclaim is the largest update ever released for a late and this update has the working title of new ever and there is absolutely no details about it at all aside from the release date of the end of 2020 the dangerous is certainly among the oldest space games on this list while it still fills plays and looks great this hope that the 2020 update knocked it out of the park warframe isn't technically a space game poodle Vantage due to change in 2020 with the game's newest upcoming update called Imperium and it will place full of spaceships in the control of players hands and having them to engage in ship-to-ship combat as with everything in warframe though it doesn't end there Imperium now will also allow players to roam around the interior of their ships and will offer full of shipboard in combat this means it will be necessary to repel aggressive NPCs from your ships and also means that you will have the ability to gain entry to enemy vessels in order to take them down from the inside that's one of the oldest titles in this list warframe arrived in 2013 and soon established itself as one of the best examples of a life service game and the open development is certainly refreshing to say the least the Imperial update then is set to change the game on a number of levels making now perhaps the best time ever to start getting into warframe the sister title to star citizen the single-player campaign driven squadron 42 is still officially scheduled for beta release in 2020 however continued delays on the roadmap have led to expectations that the title might slip into 2021 for now however developer CID are still officially aiming for a beta release of 2020 squadron 42 then is set to feature all manner of spaceships as well as first-person gameplay headed by a cast of Hollywood actors such as Mark Hamill Gary Oldman Gillian Anderson and Henry Cavill this title almost certainly is as much of a movie as it is a game and as perhaps to be expected with it being a spiritual successor to the video driven win commander series it's a title that cij are attempting to keep under wraps in terms of story through fears of releasing too many spoilers and where first squadron 42 is certainly an ambitious game and is going to be extremely important for cij ever space 2 is very much a massive evolution of the original titled no longer a roguelike ever space 2 opens up to a full galaxy with hundreds of locations and multiple star systems to explore the visuals are absolutely stunning and just begged to be explored like any true space gay players will have the ability to fight trade and explore as best suits their own individual approach westphall release of the game is still a fair way off developer rock fish studios have been busily showing off the extremely functional demo prototype build to the game and this is one that I've personally had hands-on experience with and I genuinely feel this title is offering an extremely impressive space game experience persistence of cause is a big thing for any space title and that is one area in whichever space to dramatically changes compared to its predecessor in a new title players will have a permanent base of operations at where they can dock and store their ships blue Katherine and ship upgrades are a massive focus for the game with the developers comparing it to traditional looter games such as the Diablo series now this may seem a bit of an odd comparison for a space game but it's one that makes sense as the game offers massive amounts of upgrade paths and looting options this then along with the unique visuals and rapid deep combat experiences are all set to make ever space - one of the standout space games of 2020 the title is due to enter early access towards the end of 2020 with the full release scheduled for 2021 now here's a very brief look for no man's sky which had a fantastic year in 2019 with a slew of updates that hold it all intents and purposes turned it into one of the best space games available hello games have stated that more updates are to come in 2020 and if those updates or anything like 2019 then no man's sky players were in for a real treat unfortunately there's not a lot I can say about this particular title as pretty much everything has been said and unfortunately there's nothing left to say it for 2020 as our for now at least we don't know anything but I'm pretty confident that no man's sky is going to continue to evolve into the one of the best ever space games if a lion has been around since 2003 and will no doubt continue into 2020 and beyond what's there's little information on the development of the game over the coming year a new Eve titled is now available and this is Eve echoes a mobile version of the game and surprisingly the mobile version of the game is EVE Online in its true form developers CCP have teamed up with Nettie's in order to get this game produced and CCP's long heritage is very much apparent in short then Eve echoes is a full-scale space game with all the trappings there seems to be no intention to limit this game for the mobile market and as such the full complexity of EVE will eventually be present on this platform existing as a fully independent game world Eve echoes will have a no association with the events or server of the PC title or that you can expect to find a fully driven player economy and no doubt Echo's will quickly generate all the player created stories and intrigue that the PC version of the game is famous for Eve echoes is currently available as a better title for both Android and iOS and it continuously receives extensive updates with the exception of star field Beyond Good and Evil 2 is perhaps one of the most high-profile upcoming space games simply because it's being created by one of the largest Studios they aren't there Ubisoft now even though the title of the game contains 8 to within it it's nonetheless a prequel to the original 2003 title joining the space titles was seamless space travel among atmospheric worlds Beyond Good and Evil 2 injects a huge amount of detail into its game world largely storage Ravana the title will essentially be an RPG with spaceships each planet will apparently have its own society within which the player can engage in certain tasks and all of this can be affected by the decisions the player makes within at the game currently Beyond Good and Evil 2 doesn't have a release date so what 2020 is a remote possibility it does seem unlikely but it nevertheless deserves an honorary mention here in this video it also seems entirely possible that this will be a next-generation release cover with space program - without a doubt is going to be the most scientifically accurate space game here allowing you to build rockets and relying heavily on accurate real-world physics Kerbal space program has always been one of the best games to teach you about space and orbital mechanics Kerbal space program - then will up the ante in pretty much every way especially on the scale factor following the original theme of allowing players to create their very own rockets and spaceships and challenging them to function correctly any successful rocket launch is an achievement in its own right some of the new highlights of the game include interstellar travel the ability to build colonies and multiplayer this game is almost guaranteed to generate huge interest and is still aiming for a 2020 release so then that concludes this look at the most important releases and updates for space games in 2020 as you can tell there's plenty to look forward to as a ways thanks for watching I catch you guys until next time [Applause] you
