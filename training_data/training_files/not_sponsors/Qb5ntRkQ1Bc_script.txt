this video has been sponsored by Nord Austin eruption to protect your privacy online today it's pretty rare that a product stands the test of time we've seen so many video game franchises pop up have an absolutely bonkers fandom for a few months and then promptly die out rest in peace cube world and all of these once thought of as a fad I think it's pretty clear that 23 years later Pokemon is here to stay it's been a minute since I've dived deep into one but with the latest monster catching collection sword and shield on the horizon I'm getting pretty excited but that's not what we're talking about today welcome to part 2 of the Pokemon clones the sequel to my 2015 video geez I hear a lot of y'all are mad about the lack of a national pokedex in the new games in that case let's talk about some pokemon clones alternatives and in some cases straight-up ripoffs but what is a pokemon clone now I could just call this whole video shouldn't Megami Tensei clones if we're being real but I'm trying to talk about games that don't necessarily deal with the complete destruction of humanity just like cube monsters yeah don't be sad my general focus here is gonna be games that deal with collecting leveling up creatures or ones that have the look and feel of Pokemon you know the ones know muy mando so yo its Austin and once again we're gonna be diving into the world of Pokemon clones now I'm gonna miss some there are a ton of them however since sword and shield are on the horizon I was thinking hey maybe I make a couple of these videos maybe you let me know right down there sometimes a clone might pop out of a franchise that doesn't really make sense at first but then you're like oh okay sure not like Digimon but something a little weirder who here remembers shaman king oh god shaman king I remember not much about this one back in the day I was subscribed to the English Prince of shounen jump when it was like Naruto Dragon Ball Z Sandland Yu Yu Hakusho one piece and shaman King all I really remember about the show is that this guy's name was yo and this girl Anna and she was cute despite the fact that she's basically wearing a tablecloth on her head I don't know I was like 13 anyways all of these anime kids are shaman and underrated warcraft class and someone who can tap into the world of the dead except since this was a shounen anime that means everyone gets a fighting partner in the case of yo amita maru he's a dead samurai man spirit thing in fact it would it be too far-fetched to call Shaman King a proto youkai watch which by the way I'm not talking about this time next time I've promised shaman King was pretty damn popular in Japan and also did pretty well in the States getting an old-school proper for kids dub hell yeah now with any vaguely popular anime we've got video games the concept of the show alone lends itself pretty heavily to gaming we got like fighting games Metroidvania a strategy RPG on the ps2 but most importantly a pokemon clone that as far as I can tell did not release in Japan I mean it says Konami Japan here so I whatever this is Shaman King legacy of the spirits soaring Hawk Edition that's a mouthful there's also sprinting wolf but I was never much of a wolf kid growing up I'm more of a majestic bird you know you tuck the bald eagle shirts directly into the jorts liberating what can I say it's Pokemon but with dead people yeah not like dead creatures or cute monsters like in yokai watch but like this I mean it makes sense when you have yo summoning like a meet Amaru or some other ancient looking warriors from times past why is there a 7-eleven clerk on my team why is this random doge attacking me why is the burger lady so scary like she's not looking towards the enemy but directly at the player as if she's wanting to possess you also her attack is leaked I don't like it shaman king has a lot of dialogue too much also a stupid amount of encounters at least she can finish him quickly actually somehow the battles and legacy of spirits feel less animated than pok√©mon red and blue which is saying something your spirit just kind of sits there dead face and jiggles a little bit when you get hit kind of like nothing excites them anymore I feel like the game feels that way too if you happen to die in combat it doesn't like reboot or take you to the main menu like any other video game it's like game over please turn off the power take a shower wash your foot damn dude I will say I appreciate the amount of effort they spent on cross-licensing for this though is my favorite dead person Hank Hill the concept of shaman king translates really well into a Pokemon like RPG but they sure dropped the ball on this one it's like aggressively mediocre or painfully average there's too many random encounters combat is uneventful it's boring to look at and imbalanced but worst of all look at this cat are you okay Oh shiny next up we have a video game I always looked at from afar with a sense of wonderment I saw this man with giant red hair and I was like wow I wish I could be you now there's a ton of monster collecting games on the PlayStation 1 but today we're gonna be talking about Azure dreams back in the day konami used to take all kinds of weird risks yeah believe it or not they used to do things besides boards remakes Pro Evolution Soccer and bomber girl late 90s Konami's specifically on the PlayStation 1 was ridiculous yugioh was starting to take off so there were a lot of games for that Castlevania Symphony of the Night set a new standard not just for Castlevania but practically helped to create a new genre of platformer Henao kojima was breaking new ground with snatcher and Metal Gear Solid Suikoden one led into Suikoden 2 which was one of my favorite games of all time somewhere in the middle of all of that Konami tossed a new IP out into the wild known as Azure dreams you ever played one of those mystery dungeon games long before we had a term for it shun sobs mystery dungeon series of games were kind of a proto roguelike the term and genre of games turn around just about everything these days do you lose any progress when you die roguelike Mario Brothers is a roguelike you don't even carry over power-ups when you dive mystery dungeon games haven't really been fully embraced by a Western audience as they're a casual my first exposure to these games was chocobo dungeon 2 on the PlayStation 1 I thought it was really cool until I died and lost literally everything all of my items gone these games are mean but oh are they fun I just had the age like 15 years in order to fully appreciate them let's hop into Azure dreams you play as Coe the son of the famous monster hunter Co yo screw it Austin though I did have to look at this horrifying 2d trying to look 3d baby spray in order to do it make sure you're positive make every effort and live life happily and joyfully to the fullest so our dad dies right away actually he dies before we even start the game because the opening cutscenes like sadly he died early so we get to have the emotional whiplash of it happening twice it's like three minutes obviously this here's the Pokemon clones video so we're the Mazda zan well once you hit the bustling age of 15 you decide to go into the tower where your father passed away and take over for for some reason all of my dialogue choices are hella sassy like all the time makes sense though because the localization here has everyone being mean to you all the time constantly you get woken up in the morning by this neko girl who literally captain falcon's you I'm surprised you can get up after that puppy but yes so you head to the tower and immediately run into this cute little thing called kyun they're like hey you're gonna be my monster tamer now and you're like okay is there a reason he comes to you immediately is it your dead dad's monster I don't know the tower plays exactly like one of those hard-ass mystery dungeon games except you get to find and tame monsters now anytime you enter the tower ko starts out at level one and only has I touch you brought in with you if you leave your level resets however any experience gained by your monsters is kept they're gonna be your main method of progressing as well as any weapons and armor you bring out of the tower however if you die without teleporting out you lose all of those items so don't don't do that so how about those monsters huh you get to meet a lot of cool monsters like balloon troll Poppa Loompa there are there eggs you find in the tower and you like you hug them you give them a big ol hug but outside you that takes a while mini hugs at first you only have one collar so you can only have one monster on the field at a time but eventually you get multiples so you can have a bunch at at once they can attack on their own with tweakable AI or you can manually toggle their attacks or you can just rely on them to do everything for you like a like a true Pokemon master however as you isn't just a dungeon crawler it's actually a dating sim your ugly short look porn your father's dead that is what is so great about you [ __ ] what welcome to the metagame of azure dreams when you aren't collecting monsters to dungeon with your collecting girlfriends to fill out a diamond on your safe file as well as sweep up your floors give you goodbye kisses items and have more people to assault you when you wake up just they're so mean this game is a strange flirting is just genuinely baffling to me in reality and also in the game but the majority of the girls you run into just talk constant trash gia insult your social standing and just just just anything is this what it's like in real life you end up having to compete for their affection with gosh or ghost the town wannabe womanizer he's rich and makes fun of you for any reason mostly money then that's why you have to date his sister the original selfie I hear you wet your pants in the tower Austin such a mystery not in the mood for the aggressive type try cheryl via bedridden sick anime girl [Music] yo 1997 was wack also I've been trying not to say anything about their eyes but I mean the eyes though they're coming off their face yo I will say it's pretty cool to watch your town progress as you get higher up the tower towns Foulke ended up asking for favors like building new places to hang or filling out the pool base building has always been one of my favorite things in RPGs so having all of this here and this weird Konami made Pokemon Cologne is pretty cool as your dreams is not a cheap one to find these days but if you ever manage to play it I'd recommend it maybe it's a bit dated and weird in 2019 but it's a fun time you might like it if you're a grandpa like me but wait there's more this is as your dreams again I'm glad to know that these eldritch horrors known as anime eyes are still intact the original Azure dreams didn't go gangbusters or anything so konami decided to port it to the gameboy color and give it another shot on the platform that made Pokemon huge and well it's not the worst thing ever there are some differences between the two though it's got a lot less the game boy version focuses on just dungeon crawling but that means there's no buildings to be built and there's no girls to beat you up it's pretty decent for a portable game of the time but unfortunately it also failed to connect with an audience in Japan and in the States I just think that maybe the mystery dungeon format of video game isn't that popular it can't sustain a ton of franchises there's also a spin-off sequel that came out on the DS called towels adventure which has great reviews but maybe I'll check that out another time cuz right now I gotta piss my pants makes me mysterious similarly to peeing in your pants let's talk about mobile games the iPhone and Android mobile stores are the wild wild west for bootleggers II name a popular franchise it's their unofficially represented by some horrible horrible ripoff like hey you know hello neighbor well this is angry neighbor it's different Pokemon of course is not exempt from this if there's one franchise that isn't safe here its Pokemon now a ton of these have made the waves I'm sure you've seen random mobile ads for these Bob's that have been like but today I want to talk to you about two specific ones let's start with trainer Canyon choose your favorite fari or a Ferrari yo dope start let's install this on BlueStacks on a Windows virtual PC over a VPN in a library oh god this is trainer Canyon this is probably someone's stolen fan art in fact it is and I tried to find you but you erased your pixiv but pretty cool grand you dude good job everyone can I give them a round of [ __ ] if you've ever been to a flea market I'm sure you've seen those bootleg looking figures that have like a buff mr. incredible with spider-man and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles well this is the video game equivalent of that it says trainer Canyon they even made up some BS designs with the store page but it's not it's not a trainer kid that's the Pokemon you know why there's so many people here what's wrong with y'all go play a game real game trainer Canyon is basically exactly what it looks like low effort mindless mobile garbage designed to suck money out of the person playing it but this time with copyright infringement so much copyright infringement that trainer canyons not even the first name this game had this is literally just like it's it's Pokemon oh it looks like Pikachu it sounds like Pikachu it smells like Professor Oak all games like this do or take money from kids until they get DMCA aid so if you're looking for trainer canyons sometime in the future it might be under a different name look out y'all I'm still confused as to why there's so many people here is it is this where the National pokedex is it has to be it check out my epic level 8 blossom breath look we can stew in garbage all day or we can talk about a decent Pokemon cologne so let's do that now there's actually a bunch of these but I stumbled upon one in particular that caught my eye this here is NEX Oman when it comes to mobile games especially ones like this I'm used to no production value however next Sumon looks sounds and plays pretty well we've even got an opening cutscene with voice acting with one shattering role and they turn a war between humans and necks Amon began Oh God sword and shields gonna have voice acting at the beginning is pretty similar to Ruby and Sapphire where you have to quickly pick a polka I mean next saman from a container and fight not Team Rocket I'm glad the next time on universe found a use for those original Xbox shells good on them Recycling's nice I went with sprung because I mean who else am I gonna go with Snivy here okay sure you fight him off and then suddenly the next so lord who's totally not a super sand pops out of nowhere and well next saman happens it knows exactly what it wants to be and it does it pretty well especially for a mobile game a totally legal original mobile game you journey from town to town and counter colorful characters catch various necks aman who are all animated very well each town is ruled by an overseer who are apparently scumbags like the world of NEX amman is some dystopian society but i so cute and colorful and everything's on fire oh oh now you can't spell mobile game without microtransactions these are like avatars and Nexo traps with higher catch rates etc etc also running you pay to run that's an old meme right once you're like an hour and a half into the game next time on literally stops you at this bridge and it's like hey you gotta pay the troll toll again in this neck so hole I mean it's only $0.99 but still I've paid much more for worse it's basically exactly how I would imagine a legit Pokemon would be on a mobile device if they didn't do the whole go thing it's a bit grindy and at the end of the day definitely still a mobile game but it's a pretty neat pokemon clone maybe one day Nintendo will actually do the thing and do this look if a small group can make a clone with over three hundred and nine necks aman on mobile and have it be this quality imagine what Nintendo can do I'll tell you what they can't do flex ol get flex Todd alright I got one last game for you guys and I'm sorry it's not Dragon Warrior monsters - no yokai or dragon this time I'm sorry next time one of my favorite things is stumbling upon a game or an indie that you feel no one else has heard of so to end our clone spree today I want to talk about a little Jim known as heartbeat in all capital letters like it's screaming at you heart beat if you take a look at every game in this video so far you'll notice how they can all fit the Pokemon mold while slipping into different genres and styles one of them a mystery dungeon another whatever this was heart beat here has taken elements of Pokemon and turned it into something really weird and unique it's hard to explain but the website does a decent job when it's like quote explore a magical yet all-too-familiar world a Winky Winky but this is heart beat and it's a full ass in the RPG made by chumbo soft I'm sure one of the first things you're noticing with this one is that hey this looks really similar to Gen 3 and well it certainly does except when you get into dialogue because you'll have these pretty and large sprites of the characters pop up you play as Eve staccato a novice controvert the contour is somebody that's made a pact with a Mogwai also called mugs in this world yeah no not that mug but that's a good mug eva's partnered with a little kitty named Klein who was a type of Mogwai called a cat sit I had no idea when I first launched it but harpy is an RPG maker game that feels wild to me I've grown up with the notion of RPG Maker games looking and feeling a very specific way but I guess heart beat leaned really heavily into doing something different I'm just gonna praise this game for a second the sprites are just beautiful characters are highly detailed the monsters are cute well-designed and varied the cities and environments have this vague unmistakable Pokemon feel to them but where does the Pokemon clone aspect come into play in the world of heartbeat all of the Mogwai also possess a human form early on you fight a Cerberus who once defeated and tamed becomes a kawaii anime girl oh but not like mom on the Mogwai transform in order to fit in with human society because of story reasons I don't want to spoil it because it's got a pretty good narrative your party members aren't catchable so much as they just are in your party at certain moments in the story so in that aspect it's not necessarily a monster collectathon it's almost as if like Pokemon took its concept in a direction more similar to the anime where other Mogwai exists in the world which you only encounter and have journeys with certain ones and in that game they have distinct personalities and character development and maybe they have to remind you they can smell the difference between food and musk you inhumane bastard however you do have access to a reasonable monster this little guy right here boochi boochi starts out like this little baby coward monster however he accompanies you in combat but you have to feed it and raise its stats and equip it with DNA strands these are collectible items you find throughout the game that allow your little butchy to transform into whatever little monster you've found sometimes there are many versions of the main casts animal forms and other times they're just whatever this is I like it you don't have control over it in combat but you need to take care of your booty in order for it to assist you properly there you go there's the Pokemon thing it counts so yeah maybe I stretched the definition of a Pokemon clone a little bit but the entire time I was playing this I felt like someone took the Pokemon concept and just ran with it anyone who watched the original Pokemon anime probably remembers how ornery Charizard was when you play something like let's go Eevee you get your little guys like eternally but heart beat took time to do the opposite of that listen I'm just saying that it's nice to have a monster I bonded with to say that I'm stupid idiot because I am but if we get into the gameplay we do have a lot of limitations because it is in our PG maker game but jumbo soft sure made the best of what they had more so than Pokemon heartbeat leans into Shin Megami Tensei because this game is real hard it's not Shin Megami Tensei 3 Nocturne or anything but I'm surprised at how difficult they decided to make the base difficulty despite the very cutesy look thankfully you can put it on baby casual mode for those of you who are baby casuals like me now obviously it's not perfect I had a couple of weird glitches and freezes happen in my playthrough had a couple of issues with the map abilities as well each of the Mogwai has an action they can do on the overworld map such as cutting grass crawling into small spaces or jumping ship has a charging ability because she's a heifer and there's a puzzle where you have to charge from button to button but it's a little Jake there's also the leveling system which suffers from that RPG maker gating since every zone offers different enemies and the jump in XP u gets ridiculous you'll go from barely anything increasing your meter anymore to BAM an entire level in one battle it's a miniscule observation but still a weird thing also there's a lot of girls in this game like every single main character is a female I was wondering if it was some kind of statement so I took to the forums where I found this post by the lead developer who was basically like yeah I just really like girls they're pretty dope and I mean yeah sure I agree I think most of us agree heartbeats surprised me it's been out for a while on each day oh but late in 2018 it popped up on Steam where I hope it started to cultivate some sort of a fandom I really enjoyed my experience with it I loved that a game is deceptive with its storytelling seemingly innocent at first but then revealing a much darker an adult side as it moves on I really like how it subverts the expectations of not only an RPG maker game but also the possibility of a pokemon clone also the soundtrack is like extremely good I'm sorry I'm not ending this on a bad game I just really wanted to talk about a heartbeat bye bye in a post undertale world I know that sounds ridiculous it's kind of hard to get noticed even as an indie now because you have so many games coming out left and right with tons of personality fighting for your attention on top of the whole triple-a thing that's already going on so congratulations heartbeat for catching my attention you did it good job I liked it that's all for today I'm gonna talk about the one thing that I said I was gonna be talking about next time but it might be like a month or two so yell at me I love you let me take a second to
