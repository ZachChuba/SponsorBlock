hello everyone and welcome back to another minecraft update video this one covers multiple pre-releases and the last one I covered on this channel was pre-release free and since then there's been loads of pre releases coming out faster than I can cover them so we're doing it all in one video and this probably means that we are getting closer to the release of a 1.16 maybe we'll learn a release date real soon but I think it's just around the corner so anyway we're gonna go through these pre releases one by one but the first thing I'm gonna do is cover two things related to pre release free so I pride myself on trying to be as accurate as I can be when making these videos and on occasion I got it wrong and that's what happened last time around and I would like to correct myself we were talking about bounding boxes and a change that will come after 1.16 that will affect nether farms and now I have turned on a mod to show us the area in which this change is going to take place it is not these structural bounding boxes which are yellow right here it is the overall bounding box this cyan color of the entire fortress ok mobs are able to spawn out here if you place down nether brick or wither skeleton can spawn out here you can build a farm in this space the change will be that it's this space here that they won't be able to spawn in in a future version of Minecraft and to clarify that means they can spawn inside of these structural shapes highlighted by the yellow area here so you would be able to extend the platform of a crossroads and still have a farm a built in this section the second thing I missed from pre-release free was the inclusion of these free tags Infini burn ends nether and overworld these tags simply identify that nether AK and magma blocks can burn forever in the overworld that rule is the same in the nether because it references the rule from the overworld file but in the end dimension we learned that bedrock can infinitely burn and I did not know that and there you go fire on bedrock in the end dimension never goes out you learn something new every day with this game I swear so these free releases are loaded with bug fixes a lot of which are just related to things that break in the recent development cycle and so I'm just picking out the most in one of these things to communicate to you so let's start with pre-release four and this one is the smallest of all the pre releases some changes to mob spawning rates here in Seoul San Bally's you should see very slightly more ghasts overall and a few more skeletons on average and over here in the Warped forest you should see more Enderman on average those are the free mobs that have had their spawning rates tweaked in the nether some of the recent changes involving creating water buckets inside of your inventory didn't work the same way we're getting milk or getting a mushroom stew so now when I click on this again you'll see we just keep the one mushrooms true or the one milk bucket in our inventory this also created a bug in survival mode where the item completely gets consumed when you use it like this it just disappears and that has been fixed in a later pre-release in pre-release 5 a GPU worn list was added to the game for graphics drivers that don't support or have issues with the fabulous graphics so this new graphical option was added in pre-release 1 and if your computer has an issue of it you'll see this warning screen and it will give you information about what the problem is and you can of course ignore it at your own risk you might run into some issues though with the game and how it looks if you have ever thrown snowballs or eggs in this game you'll know that it appears right in front of the camera when you throw it sort of like what's happening right now except in this pre-release it will now appear just a little bit later so it doesn't flash up right in side of your face this is actually something added in one of the combat test snapshots it's nice to see it make its way over here to one point 16 villages and the wandering trader now know that they should flee from the Soglin this was just something that was overlooked they wouldn't actually run away from azog Lin mob which they now both do you are now able to control middle-click a lectern and that will copy across its contents which it wasn't doing before it would just copy a blank lectern the same now goes for jukeboxes so let's control middle-click place it down over here give it a right-click you can see it's got the record inside of it one thing I will point out is that the music isn't playing that's the one source of music so when you place it down it doesn't start playing the record when you shift-click never i ingots into a smithing table it now goes into the correct slot where before it seemed to go over here shift clicking and now goes to the correct space there was a bug that allowed naturally spawning iron golems to spawn inside of blocks just like this so if you had an iron farm you can imagine that was causing a whole bunch of nightmares this is fixed in this pre-release tutor recent changes and bug fixes that were introduced and then removed these zombified pick lines were dropping experience when dying aggressive but not ingots and not nuggets that's been patched and restored so if you got a gold farm using their aggression that will continue to work in a 1.16 there was also a bug that stopped mobs from getting damaged when crushed by a soul Sam block or a path blocks light was basically not full that's been patched they will take damage once again and in pre-release six we have changes we have bug fixes and a technical change the advancement trigger player interactive entity has been added this allows you to match an entity being interacted with by an item that the player is holding so onto the changes the map colors of crimson and Warped materials have been tweaked you can see the colors on the map and the blocks are just over here there is now text inside of the recipe book that says search over here just to make it clear that you can click here and you can search whatever your heart desires the game mode switch a menu will now have a new default when you create a fresh world of course it remembers what you switch between but when creating a new world if you're in creative mode the default switch is going to be to survival and if you're in survival adventure or spectator mode the default switch will be to creative hog linz and zomlings used to share the same texture for their tusks in fact it almost looks like this one is now slightly golden well anyway this is a change for resource pack makers as you'll now be able to give each of these unique tasks this is a peculiar detail but when throwing a splash potion on the ground the particle effects appear in the furthest north east corner so fro to that spot and it wherever I fry it always appears at the most northeast of that block and so now they appear to just form at the center of the block regardless of where the splash potion actually lands inside of that block this is what's known as a undead villager a zombie village it's very rare to find one of these in your world there was an issue though that these zombie villages that spawn inside one of these which is regular zombie villages meaning that if the player were to go away they could be spawn they are now are going to be persistent so when you find a village like this all of its inhabitants should remain as long as they haven't burned up in the daylight loading redstone from structure blocks would actually forget if the redstone was in the dot or the cross state that will be fixed in this pre-release when placing kelp into flowing water it creates a source block this is a known little trick and the chain was actually behaving the same way now when you put the chain into flowing water it actually cuts the water off as you can see here due to changes to knock back resistance introduced in snapshot twenty wo6 a mobs like the ravager actually lost their knock back resistance and now it's been given back to them so I'm hitting it with a knock back to sword and as you can see it's resisting that and this includes other mobs as well like the hog limb for example here in the end dimension you confer an ender pearl into an end gateway to get teleported to a new location and if you've done this in survival I've experienced it on occasion you've thrown an ender pearl and nothing happens apparently this has been fixed so hopefully we won't get irritated by things like that happening in the future before this pre-release pig Lin's were unable to spawn with enchanted gold gear and I do believe the chances of this actually happening are extremely rare so as I spawn a whole bunch in here we're probably not gonna see it but they will now be able to spawn with enchanted gold gear baby pig Linds are now going to run away from wither skeletons so just a simple oversight that the baby ones weren't running away which they now do and peatlands are known to be afraid of the soul camp fire but there was a slight oversight they would also be afraid of a soul camp fire that was put out so the difference now is they're not afraid of this one or are they oh maybe they still are but this was supposed to have been fixed if you have your subtitles on you'll see that these zombie pig lines they grunt however if they're angry at you that subtitle will now say that these zombie pig Ling grunts angrily so this obviously released the players that rely on the subtitles and lets them know if the zombie piglet is angry or not so now let's look at pre-release Evan there's nothing but bug fixes here and all of these bug fixes are related to the pre releases and very recent snapshots which means we're really getting to the last parts of development now as they're not tackling big and old bugs this is all about polishing up 1.16 so this means there's lots of silly bugs that are barely worth talking about which only occur in the pre releases so I was holding down forward and jump and in this level of lava if I hold down forward and jump I get stuck here and that's just a silly little pre-release bug so for that reason we have very little to talk about but if you have a zombified pig Lin golden XP farm you'll probably have seen my recent videos talking about the changes to this and in that process it turns out that these mobs are actually dropping less than half the amount of experience points that they would have done before these changes are made so in this pre release things are all back to normal they drop gold they drop golden ingots and they also drop the right amount of XP and earlier in this video we talked about the spawn rates of skeletons and ghasts inside of the soul sand valley well apparently those changes won't actually implement it correctly and it looks like this pre-release is the one where those spawn rates are actually adjusted last of all we have two changes related to resource packs and textures so the zombie pigmen has a raised arm but its sleeve layer would have been down at the side and this picture from the bug report shows you what's going on there so that's been patched the sleeve layer will raise with the arms and previously these Striders were using the same texture for both legs as you can see here the left and the right side are identical but now in the resource pack you'll be able to give both of their legs a different texture and now we're going to talk about pre-release eight and in this one there's quite a few bugs related to tridents that have been fixed like four or five of them and they're all to do with the way the treinen appears when you hold it and right now it looks normal but if I remove this from my offhand and do again in pre-release seven it appears behind your head which is so silly but let's put the bow back on the off hand and if I charge it and then flick to the Trident you can see the Trident is the wrong way around so like I said that and a few other similar bugs had been fixed and here's something that have been a problem a long time ago in the game you would put water above grass and then the grass below wouldn't decay into dirt which is supposed to do so this was a bug that supposedly got fixed and it's been noticed that now what happens is the grass turns into dirt too quickly when water is above it this should be happening at a far slower rate so in pre-release 8 you should see your grass stay around for a little bit longer if water is above it so we talked earlier in this video about how pig leans never spawned with enchanted armor which they now can do but when this was implemented it was done incorrectly and it was possible for these pig lines to have a ridiculous amount of enchantments on a single item and so that's been taken care of and there were quite a few other bug fixes as well but most of these just related to the recent pre releases and were you know small little bits of game mechanics that are broken in the pre-release is just getting fixed so if you want to read up on these changes there'll be links to the blog posts in the description box down below if you enjoyed the video be sure to comment down below that's it for me thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next one bye bye
