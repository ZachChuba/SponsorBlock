400 documentaries from some of the world's best filmmakers [Applause] tyler the creator wasn't always who he is today he's honestly a pretty calm guy at this point he runs one of the most successful rapper clothing brands in the world his camp flogging festival attracts the biggest names in hip-hop and his last project flower boy was nothing if not authentic emotionally vulnerable and consistently excellent but that wasn't always the case like i said tyler spent the first half of his career intentionally backing himself into a corner with some of the most vulgar lyrical content hip-hop had ever heard but his third album wolf marks the first point where he started transitioning away from his fictional persona as a serial killing rapist and began experimenting with music theory stylistic variation and emotional honesty just listen to the contrast between the opening track on tyler's second album goblin versus the opening track on wolf they're structured the same with both of the tracks featuring a dialogue between tyler and dr t c the alter ego he uses to represent an imaginary therapist on goblin the album starts in the middle of a conversation between tyler and dr tc but this conversation at the beginning of goblin is actually a continuation of how tyler's first album bastard ended bastard's final track includes a skit where tyler shoots the side of his personality that suffers from trauma regarding having never met his father hence the name bastard but back to the main idea here the opening tracks on wolf and goblin are structured the same way it's the beginning of goblin and dr tc is talking to tyler about how he's too much of a [ __ ] to kill anyone let alone kill himself and then you switch back to the opening track on wolfe released a year later and dr tc is a camp counselor now he's introducing a kid named wolf to a kid named sam and it doesn't go that well [Music] for a while [Music] out all the way out of yours wait a second what the [ __ ] is going on here who are these characters tyler is voicing all of them and they're at it would be because he camp a tunnel so he built a tunnel under the city and then he started selling hats for his tunnel fifty thousand half later he got bored with hats he switched to half double flamethrower he sold twenty thousand of those and then five days later he tied his car up to the most powerful okay well the theory has never been confirmed outright by tyler himself but it's widely accepted by fans that wolf bastard and goblin in that order are three parts of a trilogy that broadly discusses how tyler dealt with his mental health issues as a young man he uses techniques like alter egos skits and lyrics so disgusting that he would become the first rapper to get banned from entering england but i'm not going to lay out the entire theory especially considering that the original article suggesting the existence of such a grand storyline between tyler's first three albums is something like two and a half thousand words long and honestly it's pretty convoluted but i will say that from my perspective wolf is by far the most important piece of the puzzle if you're trying to look at tyler's career and artistic evolution as a whole that is to say wolf is the turning point between tyler's miserable teenage years and the artistic freedom he finally found on flowerboy and more importantly wolff is actually a beautiful album in its own right as well the way that tyler uses alter egos and characters to build a story is notably interesting to begin with but their purpose as a storytelling device is where the album really shines it allows him to open up in ways that other hip-hop artists never would using the characters as manifestations of his trauma and anxieties this is what makes wolf truly fascinating where the camp narrative is interesting and thought-provoking it's not entirely coherent and looking at tyler's deep dynamic songwriting provides far more valuable insight into who he is as an ever-changing person and artist the big difference between tyler's bastard goblin and wolf lies in shock value you see tyler burst onto the scene as an anti-establishment punk rapper who would stop at nothing to turn heads by writing the most violent and disgusting lyrics he could think of and a lot of people hated him for it too it wasn't like he could expect to be unanimously accepted by the hip-hop community after writing bars about killing and raping people on songs like tron cat but as tyler grew up so did his music he came to terms with the issues that were plaguing him and inspiring him to act out and so wolff presents both lyrical and musical maturation in a major way tyler is still tyler of course but he went from a traumatized monster to a much more nuanced writer and producer his evolution almost reminds me of fleet foxes a band that was founded by a couple of high school friends and still 13 years later is mostly made up of those same friends because of this their lyricism has undergone several distinct changes over time much like tyler's the band's early songwriting wasn't much more than window dressing for their folky instrumentation it fit the theme with lyrics about country living and sunshine but beyond that there wasn't much in the way of meaning fleet fox's second album was far more introspective dealing with subjects such as nihilism and the self-centered individualistic lifestyle of the average american adult their third album crack up contains a whole new dimension of literary depth and historical context thanks to songwriter robin pecknell's entry into college at the university of columbia but all throughout this evolution of meaning and quality the fleet fox's formula is still made up of the same few basic ingredients you can tell that their sound is their sound and tyler is the same way his music remains distinct and recognizable throughout his career despite undergoing a constant process of refinement and i think in keeping the comparison with fleet foxes similarly to their second album tyler's wolf marks the first time he really opened up to the world as an artist and started looking at why he felt angry towards the world rather than just expressing the anger this to me is the mark of a truly talented artist a constant evolution of music message and personality other artists that have achieved this sort of status include pink floyd kanye frank ocean kendrick and more but it's honestly a trait that isn't too common a lot of rappers today just kind of do the same thing over and over but enough about comparisons let's get into what wolf is really all about the album opens with a meandering piano instrumental that's interrupted by tyler's guttural [ __ ] before percussion and brass joins the mix tyler is professing his hatred for an unnamed character in the same vulgar way he always has but it's not the same as before the instrumental is gorgeous and it's obvious from the very opening moments of the album that tyler's abilities as a composer and producer have matured tenfold from his last record skipping ahead a bit the sixth track answer is still one of the best tyler has ever written or composed tyler uses answer to discuss his life without a father and the ways it relates to his success as a musician his outlook is mature instead of being sad that he doesn't have a father tyler reflects on everything he's been able to accomplish without a father figure in his life his reflections are accompanied by dark meandering chords and ethereal guitar playing that gives the song a nighttime feel like i said this is one of my all-time favorite tyler songs because even though it's pretty much full of his usual rebelliousness and anger it's honest tyler doesn't hold back from talking about the ups and the downs of his experience the final track lone is pretty similar to answer but this time the lyrics are about the death of tyler's grandma the instrumental is actually lifted straight from a brazilian jazz song from the late 1960s by the percussionist and singer wilson dazneves one of the most important figures in contemporary brazilian music tyler didn't alter the instrumental at all lone tells the story of how tyler balanced the death of his grandma with his responsibilities as a touring musician as well as how he coped with the unexpected loss and then moving back a bit perhaps the most jazz inspired song on wolf is treehome95 a short track featuring erica badou a legendary singer-songwriter from texas lyrically the track is a pretty simple love song but that doesn't detract from its quality at all the uncomplicated lyricism lets the gorgeous instrumental shine the jazzy beat includes old-school synth arpeggios colorful double bass and a repetitive drum pattern the melody is provided largely by a synth and xylophone-like instrument treehome95 was probably one of tyler's best compositions yet at the time he wrote it and it's still one of his best songs today a lot of the songs on wolf are still pretty gobbling but even they contain more than enough thoughtfulness to go around the writing on the song colossus is close to stream of consciousness as tyler ruminates on the pressures of being so famous that he can't enjoy life as a normal person he writes about a crazed fan who will stop at nothing to spend time with him going so far as to violently stalk and even hurt him while the song doesn't necessarily represent an actual event it provides an exaggerated look into how tyler's experience as a celebrity has affected him all of this is to say even though tyler doesn't necessarily come from a lucky background he worked hard and now he doesn't have to be held back by his origins anymore we can all relate to that in some way or another and where the setting of wolf is a lakeside camp tyler's previous work was more like a dungeon from dark minimalistic beats to single-minded isolated songwriting based in anger and sadness tyler's early music came from a place of suffering on wolf that anger and sadness is still there but it's dissipating like fog over a lake in the early morning in approaching his music with a lush dreamy kind of production and composition tyler gave himself the space to not only air out his issues but work through them as well he takes inspiration from many artists and genres the musicality and worldview is no longer his own twisted vision but a varied and refreshing composite of many different ideas and influences wolf is almost like the seedling of a plant awaiting its turn to bloom tyler is still inside of his own box but with each passing moment he grows more willing to explore his authentic self wolf ends with a tyler still unsatisfied still vaguely angry but far more well-rounded he was still a bit of a punk that wanted to stick it to the critics but his developing appreciation for heartfelt songwriting and pretty chord progressions made it clear that tyler was traveling in the right direction wolf is indeed the middle ground between tyler's origins as a bitter angry punk and his reintroduction to the world of music as a serious and accomplished composer producer and songwriter with flowerboy but before he would reach his new heights he took a detour into the bizarre and overwhelming world of cherry bomb catalog of educational
