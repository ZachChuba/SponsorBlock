You pick a topic and then share your thoughts on that topic And there's only one very very important rule: your opinions have to be very unpopular ones Unpopular opinion: that movie you love.  Guess what?  I think it's overrated And you know we're loving this because it's another classic example of people thinking they're a lot edgier than they actually are That's one of our favorite topics here on medgy Mondays. And see here's the question I have how: do you decide if an opinion you hold is unpopular? Are you posting these opinions in the hopes that people won't like and retweet them because if they do like and retweet, well, hahaha, then... "Unpopular opinion: La Croix is actually awful It tastes like water flavored with-" and then you add a hilarious joke here! Guys, that's not an unpopular opinion Everyone knows that La Croix is terrible, including people who like it. See these are the same people who Can't remain silent any longer or who are constantly Recommending that you quote fight me unquote. I mean some of these people, some of the stuff they posted It's seriously so courageous! Unpopular opinion: Your man doesn't treat you right he doesn't deserve you Wow Woah! Thank you for that hottest of takes! I've never heard someone say that before! There needs to be a word for that the thing where a person says something that is so safe and Non-controversial but they say it as if it's it's their last stand is this brave see people like to feel special Different unique but they also want everyone to like them put more simply people like to stand out As long as they fit in Haha, definitely! 👏say👏it 👏louder👏for👏the👏people👏in👏the- Here's an opinion, but it's not an unpopular opinion. No one cares about your hot takes!  If you have an opinion 👏Just👏share👏it! You don't have to act like you're Moses, bringing it down from the mountain Do not steal, Do not murder, AND DO NOT AT ME Stop turning everything into an "I'm right and you're wrong" sort of interchange. Nobody's out to get you. I promise Because you don't like the latest Avengers movie, right? You're not a unique little flower because you enjoyed Solo: A Star Wars Story and other people in your timeline didn't you're just a person with an opinion about something that ultimately in the grand scheme of life Matters very little.
