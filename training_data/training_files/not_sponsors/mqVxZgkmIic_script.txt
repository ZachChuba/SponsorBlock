all right fine you want to know what I think about this well krill dogs let's get on with it [Music] hey guys Master COEX here now this one this one this has to be one of the most asked questions I've received in recent months about a what if topic in fact it's been one of those ones that has been gathering steam in the background ever since I even started making these waters on the very channel even I started making two a week what this is is actually pretty obvious if you've been paying attention and looking at the title of the video but having said that it is something that seems to be a little bit on the fanfiction II sort of side you know when it comes to premises but the question is how do you start this particular scenario with it being as authentic as possible to the Toriyama experience and yet also something that fans would find accurate to the way that they interpret the series in character in general there are many ways to go about this but in reality just a few of these would actually school well in both camps and this is the idea for what if Crellin became a saying you're right MARSOC oh this does seem like a fanfiction sort of question why aren't you gonna be doing this for an April Fool what if then well you know I think with all the new stories I've made over the past few years that I think we can realistically come up with something that might be you know somewhat believable based on the many times that we've gone through the story and we've received this question and we've just come up with variations on a theme during our weekly what-if roundtable live streams where you guys can actually put forward your suggestions for stories to myself have Rock and Sophie be in real time and see what we come up with with our brains working right in front of you as I've been observing the many directions that we've gone through with our initial thoughts as well as your overall musings I am going to try my best to provide my own interpretation on the thought experiment which seems like something Krillin would realistically do all could happen but before we begin I you anyway back to Crillon one of my main suppositions as to why clone would be the prime candidate in wanting to become a Saiyan or at least acquiring some of their traits is because of his connection to Goku both he and Goku were best friends for years they had that connection and for a good period of time they were relatively equal in power that is until Raddatz shows up sorry but you know it's true once Goku's brother arrived and he revealed Goku's true origins to everyone at comi house and everyone that goku knew that day things changed and the main character suddenly increased his potential and power exponentially leaving his best buddy in his wake big time in fact things got so bad for current status you know with the whole fandom as well as well as everyone around him he became a bit of a farce with many considering him to be the most useless character in the series yes I see how he can act like a goofball throughout the series but he managed to do a lot of great things including taming the Beast that is Android 16 as well as probably my realistically think the most functional family in Dragonball ever so where would we start with this thought experiment of Crillon becoming a Saiyan well a lot of people when they're supposing this theory would say that maybe Khurana would wish for this power while he namek where they had a wish going spare maybe he could make himself more useful on the battlefield against Frieza like well we got this wish so uh why not moment but I feel that that might be a little bit forced as well as a little foolish because if you had done that more people would have been ended as nimac exploded since denday wouldn't have been able to wish for everybody to be teleported away onto earth so right okay where are we gonna do it then well I think the most interesting and least obvious time would be during the five-year time skip between Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z think about it there's plenty of time to play with here as well as at least four wishes on Shenron to use without interfering with the story realistically at all mainly for the fact that Goku and chichi just disappeared into the forest to have Gohan and then nobody really socialized with each other for that entire period half a decade ever since the tournament happened yeah now I think about it that happens a lot in Z doesn't it in any case it all begins with Crillon getting an idea a while off of the 23rd mild Martial Arts Tournament one day Cronus training at Master Roshi's place and it's thinking back to that fateful day where piccolo jr. rose up and fought against his best friend Goku he was pretty awesome in fighting back against the son of king piccolo to think that that was the same kid that he once thought was a cheater and was somebody he actually once hated man that was a long time ago how things have changed yes they have Krillin been fires a Kamehameha into the ocean as he often does it's a miracle he hasn't taken out any kind of ships with that thing and he's then thinking oh man I wish I were like him being able to fend off piccolo like that that was so cool IRA him though I wouldn't have let piccolo escape that's gonna cause trouble one day he's right piccolo is out there and nobody knows what he's going to do and where he's going to strike next besides Goku might want some more pairs of hands helping him you never know as he looks at his hands Krillin starts to piece his thoughts together he's got something he wants to be like Goku right the same power potential and assured nature if he will like Goku he would be unstoppable but where would he begin how would he try and emulate his best friend does he go and live in the forest for a while and try to live off the land like Goku did for nearly all of his childhood does he maybe go and try and drink the ultra divine water to unlocked his potential or maybe eat a lot of sense of being sorry yeah Jeremy he doesn't know I mean each of these thoughts makes Crillon imagine him actually doing that in that situation and he isn't exactly excited about that what now he walks back into karma house and poses this question to his master who is busy watching TV yeah bro she isn't really paying attention to the question that he's being posed by Crillon so he's trying to brush the young man off by saying off-the-cuff why don't use the Dragon Balls to be like them or something a light bulb flashes in his mind that's it but Dragon Balls Wow think of that sooner thanks Master Roshi Roshi doesn't even look at crime leaving just right yeah yeah you do that with that Crillon takes his car and fly straight to capture call and asks Bulma if he can use the dragon radar when bomber asks why he needs it so badly he's currently gobbling excitedly couldn't reply saying I I want to uh Colin bomber blinks for a second and a one suspicious mood immediately switches to bouts of hysterical laughter and she collapses to the floor seriously what a vain wish crumb fires back oh yeah well at least I didn't try to use your mighty dragon to find a boyfriend like somebody I know bomber stops and then it's about to respond but then goes well place shirt stuff bomber gives Crillon the dragon radar and the cruel dog heads off to find the first dragon ball while he's flying he is smarting over what just happened me be taller ha you're kind of wish for a perfection when you've already got it once he has gathered the Dragon Balls and then summon Shenron Krillin thinks about the wording of the wish that he's going to pose for a second that is and then he just blurts it out I wish to be like Goku Shenron pauses for a moment and asks cruel and pauses and gets a little heated you know like Goku Shenron figuratively shrugs and grunts crawlin the wish now do you guys know about the legend of the monkey's paw and the phrase be careful what you wish for well we're seeing that in action right here it's a good thing that Crillon didn't wish to specifically be like a Saiyan or else we might have had to deal with an evil Saiyan on birth already Krillin without realizing it is now no longer human he is now a saying just like Goku and thankfully he's also inherited Goku's bump on the noggin you know being a good nature at first Kron doesn't feel all that different but then he suddenly feels a surge of adrenaline coming from his back and then out of nowhere he sprouts a tail like Goku used to have this freaks Krillin out and he is now scared about what's going to happen to him next as Jen was watching he mentions no take-backs I mean pieces out before he has to answer any more questions next Krillin feels another surge of adrenaline this time pepping him up like nothing has ever done before he feels great then his head feels hot as the follicles of his head begin to rapidly produce hair to round about the same style as it was in the Buu saga Krillin has no idea what's going on but all he can think about right now is training that's weird I mean you're like training sure but you never wanted to train this much before he's spoiling for a fight and with that he goes after the guy he wants to be and that is Goku wait something's holding him back it's human Seidel what once once human not yet Krillin original mind is able to rein back this impulse and things wait I need to train on my own first before I go up against Goku he'd be me instantly Wow he's training all that Goku thinks about I guess I got what I asked for with that Krillin goes to train for a few weeks and begins to feel the benefits of being like Goku he trains for longer recovers faster and he feels stronger every time he trains even if it's just by a little bit more than he's used to that my friend is a little taste of the uber power that is the Zheng Kai when he feels ready Krillin flies over to Goku's place and casually walks in the door to find chichi playing with a baby Gohan what don't COO had a kid Goku walks up behind Kron and Pat's him on the shoulder hey buddy what brings you here Goku doesn't notice the tail yet because Quillin stopped it down his trousers to try and not arouse suspicion he didn't want Goku to know that he cheated and used to wish on the dragon to make him more like him before you asked though yes chrome was able to avoid the moon when he realized he was exactly like Goku since now that would happen to him Krillin asks Goku thickets bar for a little bit after the surprise of seeing Gohan subsides and the two fight for a little while outside Goku is pretty surprised at how much Crillon is improved in the couple of years since they last saw each other at the tournament in fact there are times with the little guy is able outdo him which really surprises Goku Goku is really getting into this and decides to go all out and lands a sweeping kick which causes Crillon to roll over backwards several times his tail spilling out of his trousers and this catches Goku's attention what the tail crows busted hey Krillin did you always have a tail I remember seeing you one when we were kids Krillin is flapping around trying to come up with some kind of excuse but can't find one and so decides to tell his friend the truth Goku laughs at the end of it and tells him not to worry about it and they she didn't ask the dragon and make you taller I mean come on that would have been so stupid Krillin awkwardly laughs - but at least Goku's not mad as a result of all of this Goku and krillen decide to train more regularly during the rest of the time skip with chichi asked quillon to not tell anyone else that they have a son since she wants the baby to have a somewhat peaceful life for the first couple of years before all the crazy shenanigans begin around the dragon team it's kind of like a given thanks to these extra sparring sessions Goku and krillen really come on leaps and bounds with their powers increasing much faster than in the original when we get to the time when rad it shows up chichi feels the time is right for Goku to reveal to the others that Gohan exists and krillen offers to play along sure enough when goku and gohan arrive at Cammy house Krillin acts like he knew nothing about this but Roshi is suspicious he can sense Crillon is hiding something and not just the fact that Goku had a son his energy feels different more I Goku's in fact on top of that for the past few years Krillin had trained less and less at calm a house and more on his own that's very unlike Crone what's going on here but these suspicions have to come to a halt as Raddatz arrives having met piccolo and then seeing two power levels of about 600 or so the tall sand then reveals to Goku that he is his brother and therefore he too is a Saiyan what Krillin is just as shocked as Goku this time around and then looks to his own tail wait I'm saying to everybody turns to face cruel well the paws out of the bag now Roshi's doubts were indeed correct and Raddatz is also left pretty dumbfounded hmm another sin that's odd I don't remember there being two of us sent to this dirt ball why would they need to what's your name pipsqueak the names Crillon and you better not mess with me or my friends Krillin that's not a Saiyan name and yet you have a tail this is just quite the mystery he then turns his attention on - Gohan who also has a tail he tries to go for Gohan like in the original but this time Krillin is able to defend Goku's kit and then goku is able to fend rabbits off who is also then forced to which still giving Goku the same ultimatum you know off 100 people in 24 hours but crucially without Gohan in his grasp for that little bit extra leverage that's where we're going to be leaving things for right now so what do you guys think will Crillon really be a major factor in the Saiyan saga after all will piccolo feel compelled enough to matter in this arc leave a comment below and let's get this discussion going and I shall see you in the next video catch you later
