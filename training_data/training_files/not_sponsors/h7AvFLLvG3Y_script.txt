hello everyone and welcome back to 4fs gaming this week we're going back to some gameplay videos to look at a handful of close fights when your teammates are down and it's up to you to save the day each decision really matters because not everyone has godlike aim and can just head click their way to victory we're going to look at some tense battles and i'll talk tactics as we go i apologize if my voice sounds a bit strange today i'm recovering from a cold so hopefully it's not that terrible but support this channel but sometimes you don't get to be the hunter when playing hunt showdown sometimes you feel like the prey your teammates are white skulls on the ground multiple sets of footsteps are wrapping around your position and you know that whatever happens win or lose this is going to be close keep calm and remember first principles and good tactics in this first match it's night i've made it brighter so you can see my team approaches stillwater and engage in other trio i swing right for a flank but i have [ __ ] aim so an enemy repositions to engage me no one to left as well hit once now i'm in a tight spot i do have a good close range weapon but there's no good cover to get to and i'm one shot from death do i run and heal or do i pray and spray if you said pray and spray well that's the correct response at this range any attempt to find cover and heal would certainly mean death especially as my teammates are busy and cannot provide cover the enemy makes this mistake after i hit them instead of killing me outright they try to run which means an easy kill remember folks that the fastest way to be safe is to make the enemy dead now what on earth am i doing here crouching still in a fight is a death sentence you've heard me say it a thousand times but here i feel safe due to the cover and placement of my team even then why am i standing still what i'm doing is listening when you're moving around the sounds of your footsteps will often mask that lethal rotation that catches you out in this instance i hear nothing but it's good to do a sound check if you are suspicious of an enemy flank now here it's all about positioning the cover of the mounds puts the battle in our favor and after exchanging shots it pays off with a double tap this is the problem with being out of cover if two enemies have line of sight on you simultaneously things become extremely dangerous yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] you think it was gonna happen they're on the road oh how the turntables my teammates stack up and die in some concertina but the old reliable quick swap will save the day things can go very bad very quickly in hunts but it looks like this trio wipe is did you hear that footsteps my first victim has been revived should i revive an ally to help me in the fight or cover the bodies of my enemies i wasn't anywhere near where you threw the bomb can hit me anyway option b is correct even without this concertina wire everywhere stopping for a revive makes you very vulnerable when the enemy is so close a lesson learned by that weird sister far too many people go for instant revives when they can and it loses them the whole fight let's move on to the next instance things start out really quite bad my teammates are dead and my poor initial positioning means that i couldn't even participate in the first fight my foes have the good stuff nitros dolces and they are hungry for kills i don't really care if they burn my team it's just potter and dan but in this instance they probably should have forcing a surviving player to expose themselves is the main purpose of burning in hunt and pushing into a compound especially one like fort to track down a hiding player is a much more difficult proposition left left that's the one who killed me nice tag his left side left side that's it to you right around the corner nice now i'm not the greatest at shooting and moving but i must say i'm proud of that little engagement it's the perfect example of how to use cover in close combat peeking for a split second to land shots using explosives to prevent healing opportunities reacting to enemy footsteps to inform positioning and most importantly re-peeking immediately after the enemy has shot and missed this is all pretty important when the enemy is carrying a weapon that will put you down in a single hit now sometimes you need to play a little bit dirty my weapon requires the enemy to close distance in order to be effective so i wait like a trapdoor spider until i feel those footsteps just close enough this is why gauging distance by sound is so important it then becomes a 1v1 game of cat and mouse i know that i'm fighting a decent player and he knows that he has to be careful because it would be bloody embarrassing if i solo wiped his kitted out team we are both skittish taking one shot and then repositioning tracking each other using footsteps to try and get in that first hit to snatch the upper hand if it's got ammo nope then the enemy disengages he has led me away from his teammates and i recognize that this may be a ploy to get in a sneaky revive i reposition but carefully because i don't really know where he is do you stay outside you can't get razors to your right footsteps now in the past many viewers have given potter flack in the comments for his backseat gaming but he also has really sharp ears so it does come in handy from time to time now it's your leg and i know what they want it's to revive their friend that dead body is the bait i sit and resume the form of the trapdoor spider it's another team and sometimes potter has no idea what he's talking about nice very very nice fight man gg gg well done don't do that they will think you're still talking now that was still very close and it came down to a little bit of gun play when the enemies being evasive jumping and strafing all over the place you will often miss if you try to aim and click on them rather let them strafe into your crosshair then fire this also works wonderfully against people rushing you with melee weapons okay one last encounter we're in alice farm two teams are on approach and things are about to get messy in the woods now these peak spots from the barn are great but most players know about them by now so take your shot and then leave immediately peeking it twice is a pretty good way to get yourself killed in the chaos of the fight my surviving teammate makes that classic mistake of working towards a revive too early and puts themselves out of cover in the middle of two teams but what am i doing just sitting in a field while he dies well i know that there are remnants of another team in the tree line in front of me and crossing out of my cover to assist would almost certainly get me killed as well was that a completely different thing let's have another look at that the enemy stripes across and then stripes back reading enemy behavior is a critical skill this repeat means that they've seen me and are now lining up a shot it's my cue to fire and move which saves my life after each engagement it's always a good idea to rotate somewhere else in this instance i'm unlucky that the entire enemy trio rotated north as well with no good cover until i reach either darrow or the tree line i am forced to engage nice strafing and occasionally crouching helped me stay alive here until i traded for the team wipe but this would have gone differently if i had stuck closer to cover and used it more like the previous clip timing my peaks to after an enemy miss and that brings us to the end of the video hopefully
