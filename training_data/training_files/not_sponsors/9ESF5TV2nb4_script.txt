Bernie Sanders is an idiot he's a deadbeat hypocrite who feeds on the entitlements of our generation I know just that statement alone will anger the neckbeards and result in a bunch of angry comments from people who uh Narada Klee dye their hair and wave the Communist flag but honestly that's okay people can be mad at me for criticizing the socialist grandpa because Bernie Sanders proposals are laughably wrong and do not hold up under scrutiny even more so he's a hypocrite who's benefited off the capitalist system he vows to destroy so ladies and gentlemen grab your rationed popcorn step out at the bread line and listen up because today I'm explaining why Bernie Sanders is a total idiot your free trial of - Lane premium for 30 days today so Bernie Sanders is an idiotic lunatic let's dive into this I think you think I'm being hyper over-reactive you Bernie Sanders was born on September 8 1941 in New York growing up in Brooklyn he witnessed firsthand his lower middle class parents struggled financially he went to Brooklyn College later earning a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Chicago in 1964 Sanders later moved to Vermont where he worked as a union carpenter and a freelance journalist he was active in the anti-vietnam war movement which led him towards a life in politics he made multiple bids for governor of Vermont in 1972 1976 and 1986 failing each time he also ran for the US Senate in 1972 and 1974 finally in 1990 Bernie Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives at this point Sanders was open about being a Democratic Socialist and he caucused with the Democrats in 2006 Sanders ran for US Senate again and won and finally in 2015 he entered the race for the presidential election he lost the nomination to Hillary Clinton who later lost to Trump just want to remind everyone and finally in 2019 Bernie Sanders is running for president once again I think you think I'm being - over-reactive you Bernie Sanders is loud and proud about being a Democratic Socialist so much so he's even claimed his brand of socialism is a pathway to beating Trump on top of his open support for socialist policies he's also very vocal about his disdain for the rich in 2015 Sanders tweeted about the income gap between the very rich and the very poor being the widest since the 1920s when Sanders was almost a teenager Sanders tries very hard to paint himself as the champion of the middle class the guy who cares about the poor like a modern-day Robin Hood he loves this moral approach tweeting we are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor I don't think that this is the nation we should be living in that sounds nice and all but it's pretty damn rich coming from Bernie Sanders the loud and proud socialist who's benefited off capitalism amassing a 2.5 million dollar fortune ironically enough a large part of his wealth came from his 2016 book about socialism not only his Bernie amassed a fortune after spouting socialist rhetoric he also owns three homes his latest being a lakefront home worth nearly six hundred thousand dollars how many yachts do billionaires need how many cars do they need give us a break you can't have it all yeah Bernie and how many houses do you need stop pretending to be the poor man Santa Claus you're just making a fool of yourself Vanity Fair says Bernie Sanders now has one thing in common with the millionaires and billionaires and other one-percenters he's so frequently attacked on the campaign trail he now owns his very own summer home Sanders was born to an immigrant struggled financially at the bottom for most of his life and made it nearly to the top it's really quite incredible because Sanders is a direct result of the capitalist system he vigorously works against according to Boston based Democratic strategist Maryanne Marsh Sanders became the very thing he criticized others for becoming and at the same time didn't fix any of the problems he's been railing about that got him to this point Bernie Sanders the socialist lunatic who hates the rich has become the very thing he's sworn to destroy he's a railing hypocrite and even college students who Sanders desperately tries to appeal to call him a hypocrite after learning about his wealth Bernie's hypocrisy was revealed once again when his unionized campaign revolted against him one of Bernie Sanders biggest promises is a $15 minimum wage now of course this is ridiculous for a lot of reasons one of them being if you raise the minimum wage companies will be forced to either cut ours or raise prices essentially making this higher minimum wage useless Burnie boy learned this the hard way when his unionized campaign revolted over only being paid $13 an hour so to try and mend this dispute Sanders announced that he would wait for it cut hours so he could pay his staff $15 an hour this has been our point from the beginning as to why $15 minimum wage will not work this hilarious blunder was later resolved but it gets worse when the Sanders campaign offered to raise salaries to that level the Union rejected the offer why you might ask because the raise would have elevated field staff to a pay level responsible for paying more of their own health care costs it turns out that Sanders pays only 85% of health care premiums for campaign staff making more than $36,000 despite campaigning on a promise of free health care for all with no premiums no deductibles no co-payments and no out-of-pocket expenses so it looks to me like Bernie Sanders is not only a hypocritical wealthy socialist but he can hardly make his own campaign promises come true for his staff so I have to ask how on earth does Bernie Boy plan on making this crap a reality for the entire country I think you think I'm being high clip over-reactive you Bernie Sanders makes a lot of promises that sound wonderful and really appeal to the entitlement of our youth but when scrutinized they simply fall apart aside from his stance on health care being a human right which we all know is completely false Sanders has also admitted that he wants to provide health care for illegal immigrants we are gonna end that and create a Medicare for all healthcare system senator would you include the 11 million undocumented absolutely when I talk about health care being a human right last time I heard that undocumented people are you as well there are so many things wrong with this stance I'm not even sure where to start first and foremost we have a problem with illegal immigration and this is the last thing we should be offering listen up because here's how we solve the illegal immigration problem first we continue cracking down on those who enter illegally illegal immigration is against the law and those who break this law should be prosecuted secondly we need to reform the current legal immigration system right now it's far too long and far too strenuous America is without a doubt the best country and crossing the border illegally should not be easier than applying for citizenship legally finally we need to stop rewarding illegal immigrants like Bernie plans on doing it's pathetic that Sanders wants to provide health care for all 11 million illegal immigrants this is a total slap in the face to those who actually came to this country legally policies like the one Bernie is proposing only encourages more illegal immigration why would you go through the long strenuous process of coming here legally if you can just hop the fence and get free health care another big promise of Bernie Sanders is to cancel all student loan debts senator Bernie Sanders on Monday proposed canceling all 1.6 trillion dollars of outstanding student loan debt in the United States one-upping arrival for the Democratic presidential nomination senator Elizabeth Warren who is proposed canceling six hundred forty billion dollars of the debt I hate hearing Democrats rattle on about this nonsense that only entitled losers find appealing it's not daddy government's job to clean up after the young adults who willfully took out a loan to get through college this is yet another proposal that just doesn't hold up again this might sound nice but it certainly would not cancel all future student loan debts Sanders has proposed making all undergraduate programs at public colleges and universities free that would reduce the need for borrowing but it would not eliminate future student debt not even close according to the Department of Education only 45% of student loans are used to at and public colleges and universities presumably because tuition at those schools is already lower than in the private sector a lot of the student loan debt is acquired from attending private or graduate schools resetting all student loan debt sounds nice but like socialism it just doesn't work the Sanders plan controls the cost of public undergraduate education by setting tuition to zero and keeping it there so financing public higher education would become a matter of the federal government and states deciding how much they want to spend on Higher Learning the universities would have no pricing power because there would be no prices graduate programs by contrast would still be mostly free to charge whatever they like as is the case today with the president of loan forgiveness established graduate programs could be tempted to charge even more since students might never have to pay back their loans even a spokesman for Bernie Sanders admitted that the plan would not make graduate or professional school free or regulate private universities that means the day after senator Sanders hits the reset button the national student debt odometer would begin rapidly spinning again will those later debts be forgiven too if not the plan would create a generation of student loan lottery winners with losers on either side people who had already paid back their loans would get nothing people with future loans would get nothing people with debt on the day the legislation was enacted would be rewarded pretty funny that Sanders promotes the idea that our economy rewards people like the lottery yet his asinine proposal to wipe away all student loan debt would do the same finally we come to Sanders latest proposal Bernie Sanders has released a new plan for combating climate change that'll cost you know just a measly sixteen point three trillion dollars whether you believe in climate change or not this is honestly aside the point this is just an expensive pipe dream the plan generates money from various sources including six point four trillion and revenue from selling energy via power marketing authorities two point three trillion from income taxes from the new jobs created under the plan and 1.2 trillion from reducing military expenses related to protecting oil being routes I want to focus specifically on the 2.3 trillion dollars the plan claims would be made from all the new jobs just saying if you want people to care about climate change forcing them to fund your expensive efforts may not be the best path to take this will without a doubt greatly raise taxes and this isn't really that surprising we already know that Bernie Sanders has been public about raising taxes even on the middle-class senator Sanders I'll give you ten seconds just to ask the answer the very direct question will you raise taxes for the middle class in a Sanders administration people who have health care on the Medicare for all will have no premiums no deductibles no co-payments no out of extra out-of-pocket expenses yes they will pay more in taxes but less in health care for what they get already how anyone can support the guy openly talking about raising our taxes is beside me but this green New Deal would raise the taxes even more there's an estimated one hundred forty point nine million taxpayers in this country divided 2.3 trillion by one hundred forty point nine million and you get an average of sixteen thousand three hundred twenty three dollars in additional taxes per capita this is ridiculous expensive and only costs the American worker more I understand that climate change is an important issue to a lot of Americans but taxing the ever living daylights out of us hardworking Americans is not the right way to go about this Bernie Sanders makes a lot of big bold promises which sound nice but when you take a deeper look they're simply the unsubstantiated ramblings of a hypocritical grandpa in desperate need of an aspirin Bernie Sanders is a hypocrite who can barely make his campaign promises a reality for his own staff he's benefited off the capitalist system he claims to be against and his policies simply don't hold up under basic arithmetic Bernie Sanders is a total idiot [Music]
