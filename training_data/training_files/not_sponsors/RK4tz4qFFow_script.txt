hi everyone in today's video I'm going to show you how to make a very simple a tandoori chicken but before we get and leave a comment down below on what you want to see next so to start off we're gonna add in half a cup of plain yogurt 1 teaspoon of garlic paste 1 teaspoon of ginger paste a teaspoon of lemon juice 1 tablespoon of tandoori masala which you can get in any ethnic store 1 teaspoon of salt or to your taste I then 1 teaspoon of coriander powder a teaspoon of olive oil and you're going to combine all the ingredients together to really get all these flavors into the meat we're gonna make a few slits into the skinned and rinsed meat two to four slits will suffice [Music] once all our chicken is slit we're going to give everything a mix to make sure that each drumstick is coated with a marinade we're going to let this marinate overnight or for at least six to seven hours you can now place your drumsticks on a baking tray and into an oven preheated to 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 55 to 60 minutes your tandoori chicken is now ready to be eaten but if you want to take this one step further and add a whole bunch of flavor and spice then just keep watching we're going to add in 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil and let it heat up on high heat we're gonna add in one large sliced onion and we're going to cook it on medium heat be sure not to burn it we really wanted to be translucent with a yellow tint you're gonna add in one tablespoon of chicken tikka masala give it a nice mix and add a second tablespoon keep in mind you can adjust this add a little more out a little less depending on what you like we're going to squeeze in half a lemon or add one tablespoon of lemon juice give everything to stir and add in your tender e chicken to the onions your tender tandoori chicken is now ready to be served this video a big thumbs up if you liked the video
