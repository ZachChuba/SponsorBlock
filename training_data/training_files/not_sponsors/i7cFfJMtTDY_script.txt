what's happenin B's and G's and welcome back to another upgrade and unlock episode this is a series where we get certain chunks of the map unlocked by doing certain activities completing a quest getting a new level etc etc losing our hard crime and status takes chunks away if you want to know the rest of the link to the playlist down in the description okay so we're kicking off today's episode with a bit of afk to be honest raagh is just about to turn up in England and we're gonna be going to room first and all that stuff so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is spend this 40k that we made and buy ourselves a room pickaxe because at the moment we've got a D pickaxe so what we're gonna go and do is go and buy one and then FK some mother lode mine and get some ores together right where is this cheeky dwarf num off big man I would like a rune pickaxe we sell that off we need a bit of GP back nice not bad and spend that GP leave me ask for 10k still as well we got our first dance ever I've got the window open and I wasn't ready - oh my god boy now pickaxe Inc Don's home I've got everything not set up to record I was just gonna be here and AF Kang but we've never had one before obviously it's gonna go into agility because agility is quite hard to do there we go the first adjust exp coming in what do we get 15 XP which takes us close to that 83 also a very good point made in the comment section by a few of you was we don't need the full prospector outfit anyway to do the falador hard diary and I think ez might even be might even be easy a medium but I know you need it for the diary anyway so I might as well go ahead and buy it I think I can only buy yeah the boots which we all go ahead and do because that is gonna give us a little boost in mining and obviously we need the holster anyway and we can sell it all back once we're done okay so well it got myself fifty-four mining but I am [ __ ] bored of it I'm not gonna lie mining I've really struggled to do so we're gonna go on the fishing grind seeing as we unlock Port Sarim in the last episode I think we might as well start getting to the point where we can start fishing that trout and salmon so we're gonna go ahead and and get some levels here that is 15 fishing which means we can now fish anchovies gonna speed it up a little bit and that is twenty fishing which means we can now go ahead get ourselves a fly-fishing rod and go and fish some trout which is super good XP compared to how long this took to get the level so we can now use our rod there we go and we can start fishing we got 1614 feathers and now we were able to just go ahead and cook it right here I'm also going to go to the bank quickly and get myself the kitten out as you can see this guy's doing it which is a really good idea because you can just feed some of the fish to your kitten to make it grow which is gonna be helpful to have a fully grown cat later on in the account yeah so getting a shitload of XP here with the the fishing and then cooking it and I will go ahead and start dropping this I'm not going to need it so yeah we are going to drop the food but because I'm going to get the kitten anyway I'm just gonna store some of this trout and that is 500 total coming in that means it's a new chunk to open up let's have a look here we go guys where we off to oh [ __ ] [ __ ] sake bottom of the Carosi jungle I will never go there for any reason because is it the hero's quest or the legends quest one or two I think its legends it all happens in like this side of the [ __ ] map I think these three squares [ __ ] sake well I'd say total dead square but that's the way it goes you don't get everything you want in this life we've just unlocked 32 cooking which I think lets us into the cooking guild I'm gonna have to just check that but um that would be a chunk unlocked whenever we get a new guild we do get a chunk so I just need to check that that is actually a that's the requirement of 32 cooking is it that low it is that low 32 cooking is what we need so I think I have a chef's hat in the bank and obviously we've unlocked the square which has the the cooks guild in it so as long as we have a chef's hat we can oh we can get in there and that's a yeah a chunk unlocked which would be awesome let's have a look we do have a chef's hat so this is going to be a chunk unlocked and also we can buy meat pies in there for 14 coins 15 coins or something and they heal 12 which is a pretty good heal so this might be where I get some of my food from well there's four in stock from the pie shop so we can buy them pretty easily and that is our first guild entry ever on the account let's go to open up this chunk and there and see where we're going right please something useful something useful please it's not really useful but it does mean we can out walk from fire all the way over does open up the door for mine so obviously before I was going I could go in there and then walk under the Dwarven line and come up here I don't know why I'd want to do that I think you can get a cannon but it's not really useful and Ironmen nothing too great there to be honest I can't really think of anything else so uh yeah just just an easier access route from falador and Remington and being able to walk around but yeah nothing too crazy there as I was saying meat pies 15 coins there's four in stock and they and they heal to 12 which is pretty good so that might be my food source that is thirty fishing cover game which means we can now catch salmon which is just gonna add more XP to this fish and grind which is really really nice and that takes us to five ten total as well so we're actually 15 levels away from getting ourselves there another chunk and to be honest this is so quick with the cooking and the fishing that we'll probably get it here thirty five fishing cover game which means we can now harpoon tuna so there's another one to to go to if I want to get a decent healable and that is forty cooking as well so the levels really coming in stupidly quick here we'll definitely get the next chunk here there we go forty two cooking which unlocks 525 total level which means we get another chunk hopefully a good one we've had some dead chunks today let's see where we're off to next what are we gonna unlock oh we can now do a knight sword or knight's sword whatever its called that is sick okay I'll probably do that later on just not right now cuz I'm quite enjoying the afk nurse but that unlocks the am bill for the quest 40 fishing coming in at or which means we can now fish lobsters gonna stay here just because of how good the XP is I don't even know if we've got a chunk that has lobsters in it to be honest that's the problem with a lot of these levels I just physically can't go and do those things there we go three hours of afk and we have a cat thank [ __ ] for that gonna be useful later on in other quests so yeah just doing a bit of a bit of you know nice things for future Jack or future link even right that is me totally out of feathers which means I'm gonna go on and do something else I don't know quite yet what I want to go ahead and do but we did get ourselves 249 fishing and 52 cooking just literally standing here and cooking the fish which is pretty nice the levels really coming together for away from the next chunk right looks like we can complete x marks the spot which is a quest I've actually never done on any account just because yeah it came out after I'd really needed to do it but it looks like we get 300 XP in any skill we want for doing it which means we could chuck it into a dirty which means we can start that Jersey grind going and hoping we can get ourselves up to 5 agility we'll also get a chunk for doing this quest so it's literally a win-win gonna go ahead and do it and and let's see if we can I get it done so the one dig spot I was worried about was the one in Draenor but it does look like we do have it unlocked and as you can see we're just gonna go ahead and start digging up a few different areas and yeah we're gonna have it all over Draenor and finish this quest and this should be the last dig spot there we go we got ourselves the ancient casket can we open it up I don't know how this works no okay we're gonna go talk to Vey us in Port Sarim luckily we have that unlocked right we go this should be at the end of the quest hello there hello Vale and I think we're good boom there we go the quest complete another square to unlock but a big big big thing is we can use this in agility which is gonna give us what level level for agility which also takes us one away from being able to unlock another chunk on top of the chunk that we've just got for the quest we have 73 cores for 73 no way 73 XP away from getting level 5 agility which means we could start using what is it what course is level 5 oh it's literally level 10 we need to get so we need to get level 10 although level 5 we can start using the the falador wall so that could be useful we could just sit down there and use the as an agility training method but yeah as of right now but before let's see where we are off to next what Square are we gonna unlock that is proper shite [ __ ] that shite the better band camp will be useful later on in the account but right now absolutely useless can't even get to it but yeah I think that's where we start the tourist trap or the tourist trap is definitely part of that you definitely have to go there so I will be useful later but as of right now nothing too useful gonna go ahead and get this one level I'm gonna go ahead and get this one level that way we can unlock another chunk there we go we've got 31 HP coming in which actually takes us to the next level but then we also got the strength coming in which I goes to five five one we've got it literally on the same tick so that's really really nice they're coming in gonna go for that thirty attack next but let's open the chunk and see well going here we go something a little bit better please okay getting towards calavius and priest imperil still a useless chunk as of right now we got the ragam bow man there I believe but other than that pretty useless but it is just opening up that canna fish a sort of way but as of right now just a useful chunk for the future so I'm going to kill some ham guards because they drop all the ham rows which we will need in the future they also drop the damaged sword which we'll need for an achievement diary they drop some opals and that sort of stuff which would be good for crafting and just sort of an allotment of herbs and seeds and stuff like that while we're getting this attack and strength up I thought I might as well do something that's gonna help me in the future of the account and I brought some raw salmon because we can cook them down here on one of the fires so uh yeah I haven't lost my [ __ ] mind just like any good youtuber we just missed 30 strengths but we are now gonna change to attack get thirty attack which means we'll be able to use a D weaponry and we will go from there nothing we needed they're doing pretty well on the robes and stuff to be honest I think we need to I think there's a quest and I Cora which one it is but I'm pretty sure you need like two sets of hammer I'm some collecting do it's at the moment and I've accidentally gone for a pickpocket rather than a kill but yeah looking pretty good just gonna continue to that 30 attack that is 30 attack coming in which takes us to five five nine as well probably gonna start focusing on a bit of Defense now get ourselves up to that 30 defense so that we can use a D as well and then it's probably time to start upgrading the hardcore armor because we're still rocking that at the moment it's definitely not what we should be wearing but I yeah it's gonna stay here for a little longer guys if you're enjoying me out personally so I would appreciate it enjoy the rest of the video so I'm just gonna go ahead and start selling all of this off get some coin together and then we're gonna head on over to Varrick and get ourselves an a/d sword because that is gonna be our best in slot at the moment and we'll see how much money we've got after selling all this stuff to the various shops that is a nice healthy 48k on the account very very nice indeed you know by an ally sword we're not gonna buy an ally longsword because the speed of the sword makes it better DPS than a longsword and that is our new best in slot which is very nice obviously we can't buy an a/d scimitar so we'll probably just skip the ally scimitar and go straight for a runes to me hopefully yeah that in the next episode or so but yeah I don't really know where I want to go from here but I'm feeling super satisfied I think we're gonna go back to f king some fishing I've got quite a bit of things on at the moment and just a bit of background fishing would be pretty nice so we're just gonna go ahead and buy some fishing packs here and I've already buy a few more and we'll go back to just getting ourselves that 50 fishing and above right so I'm gonna take a slightly different path now we were pretty much done with fishing and cooking for now I don't want to go any further as literally no point because I can now sort of actually play rather than afk so we're gonna go down a slightly different route but an odd one as well I want to get the range up and I also want to get runecrafting up and Ivor so I look to the wiki and it looks like minor tours in the stronghold just down here drop a decent amount of pure essence amber own essence which will allow us to get that room laughing level up and also I can just range them so it's sort of like you know like double bang from a buck I get the range levels and I also get the the pure and rune essence that we'll need to then get some runecrafting levels so that's we're gonna go ahead and do gonna go ahead and Bank the remainder of this food and we'll go on over it down into the the stronghold so this is what we're gonna do I think I can actually safe spot them I believe we'll see but I've got some food anyway so I'm probably just gonna have to take a few hits so that we empty this inventory a little bit and let's actually hope we hurt our gonna hit because it doesn't look too good that looks a bit better and let's hope we get some levels and some pure essence no there we go there's our first drop like five kills in very very nice indeed that's 20 range coming in which means I can now use the willow short bow which is going to increase increase that DPS you know drop that oak we do not need that anymore and without neighbors this is incredibly annoying I'm not gonna lie we just got done while I'm doing this - or killing I don't know if this is gonna get an agility level or not let's have a look chuck it in I don't think it is but we'll see you bastard 13 XP away from grabbing ourselves that five agility but you know we're getting closer we're getting closer and closer on 245 pure essence which to be honest I was expecting a little bit more unfortunately I don't know it's just it's just a bit rarer than I thought was going to be but the range I was coming on pretty nicely and we are at five levels away from a new chunk and that is a 28 range coming in which actually gives us the five seven five total level so we can go ahead and unlock a new chunk here we go where are we off to just a water square so we will go for another one here and that is gonna unlock mudskipper point nothing too useful there yes we honest a pretty dead chunk a little bit annoying would be really nice to a lot of 14 so we can start farming I can't believe we haven't got that one yet but that is another chunk unlocked so I'm just gonna go to 30 range here so we get upgrade though wise and then we're gonna see where I want to go with next might go ahead and do some runecrafting cuz you know it's level one we do only have 75 pure essence but I might just go and mine a little bit even though I [ __ ] hate runecrafting with a passion I don't for you guys I'm getting worse of this I really am thirty range coming in there we go and I believe this might also give us a pro level one more kill we'll get one more kill just so we have the the prayer level and then we are gonna move on but we actually got 150 pure essence in the end which actually the last few kills really helped boom here we go this is going to be 25 pro coming in which means we can protect item not really hoping to use that at any time but uh there we go sort of thinking about making a tiara I can't remember exactly how you do I think you need silver bar and ER and a tiara mold or something I'm not sure if I can even have access to a tiara mold at the moment probably in Rimington I'll have a look at it after but I do want to just go ahead and do one inventory just so we can get into a bit of room crafting as you can see here we we luckily unlocked the the air altar thing here but we have to make sure we don't walk through there so it's an obvious path you know I'm just gonna stick to the right when I walk through and we're we're gonna run there and forth I did look at doing the abyss but um we need to go to east are doing to complete the abyss and obviously you know we don't have that unlocked so uh yeah those you thinking just do the abyss unfortunately not this is how little I do runecrafting I believe we use the talisman on there there we go yeah I think my highest runecrafting level on any account is my main it's like 56 and most of that is either from quests raids or tears of guthix I do not room craft at all there we go are we gonna get a level that's gotta be a level doesn't it yeah level 2 we can now craft a mind runes where is the mind altar that is level 5 runecrafting coming in which means we can now craft water runes but I look to the wiki and it says to continue doing air runes until you can do earth runes and very luckily we actually have the earth through nor earth altar unlocked so that's what I'm going to do we need level 9 runecrafting to do that we most likely get a run out of pure essence here so I'm gonna have to go and mine some but you know that's part of the grind so we got ourselves to seven runecrafting but we are now out of a pure essence so I'm gonna start just mining some I don't know how much I'm gonna get but we'll see we'll see how much I want to get but yeah we're just gonna start mining and this is very very nostalgic for me used to do this back in the day great stuff but thankfully we've got ourselves out 54 mining already so this is gonna be super super quick 420 course in [ __ ] is pure essence is what we've got so we're gonna go ahead and put this all into runecrafting that is level 9 there which means we're gonna move on to earth runes very nice indeed a little bit more XP but that's about it okay so we actually need to get hostels a talisman we need nerve talisman and the best place to do that is with the earth wizards luckily as you can see we are just able to to kill these because they are just to the left of the the number 14 square where we are currently so what yeah luckily I was looking at it I was like oh [ __ ] I'm not gonna be able to kill these but uh we are able to and yeah we're gonna go ahead and see how long this is gonna take us to kill why have I put melee armor on they're gonna cut through me that was really dumb okay anyway yeah let's kill them let's hope we get this fairly quickly right we are heavily over the drop rate 46 of these I've killed and it takes so long so gotta hop every single time we killed one it is incredibly annoying to be right it's probably taking about an hour and I'm running out of food as well and they also hit sixes so I have to constantly watch so I don't lose the hardcore I've at stairs it's horrible it's absolutely horrible I'm not having a great time hopefully we can get ourselves this earth talisman really really soon right so we've now killed 64 of the earth wizards still nothing and I'm totally out food so I can't kill them anymore because they hit like sixes on me constantly so I'm gonna have to give up on getting a an earthed iseman for now which is really annoying because I wanted to use the ER the essence that we've got but what I'm going to go ahead do is just start fishing a little bit more get a few more droughts and Salmons together probably she banked these ones rather than just drop them and yeah eat sir we need to restock about food I had like a hundred trout and I think 50 salmon have gone through all of that so yeah very annoying but that is what we're gonna go ahead and do now and so I'm just gonna be collecting a load of food so we can go back on that grind and hopefully get it I do want a few bits of food as I like overstocked as well so if we go and kill anything else after the runecrafting grind we will be all good join the CC guys links ocarina if you have it already anyone's welcome Valley's going to take us the end of this video please don't forget to Like
