hello everyone and welcome back to 4rfs gaming today we are going to look at five fights in hunt showdown and i'm going to be giving some tactical commentary this video will be full of tips and tricks to help you improve at the game the focus here is close range engagements when your back is against give it a go and see how rich you can get while saving the city okay back to the video it's time to look at fight number one one of our teammates has jumped into the lion's mouth and gone down in the boss lair while mopping up an enemy team this means it's us versus the final team on the server and one of the enemies pushes out and is isolated this makes for a simple elimination now watch here so you don't repeat a big mistake on behalf of the second enemy they're peaking an angle that is being watched by two players and that is extremely dangerous in itself but then they repeat the angle and that of course leads to their almost immediate death we then try to close in on the final enemy but we know they have a shotgun well at least i'm pretty sure they have a shotgun we have to be careful to keep some distance we can see what happens when my partner doesn't so this is literally the situation that grenades were designed for when you don't want to round a corner into a shotgun blast and i can get a quick tag this is why i carry two explosives after tagging someone with a frag he knows that they're going to be bleeding low on health and not moving rapidly so a follow-up grenade is often lethal but let's just backtrack a bit why wasn't i worried about that explosive that they threw well in this case i could actually see it was a dynamite stick and i was able to tell that i was outside the lethal radius just by the sound you can actually tell different explosives apart by the sound they make but i wouldn't bet my life on it too much so if i didn't actually see the explosive go past me i probably would have run my grenade is able to finish the fight and it looks like the enemy was really caught with his pants down our next clip is another close range fight against shotguns despite a decent position on the roof when my partner engages i know that i have to get down and help many players make the mistake of not backing up their partner in times of need and that is to the detriment of their overall effectiveness now what happens next is all about crosshair placement as i round the corner i'm aiming essentially using sound to place my shot even though i can't see my enemy yet my crosshair is just under head level so i can flick it up it's better than having to flick it down because you might not actually see your target if they're obscured by your gun now the grunt here is essentially marking the last enemies position for me and that means again the frag against shotgun at this range is an obvious choice now i cook these so that they detonate just as they land or even a little bit before and this is because it stops any detritus on the ground from interfering with the blast and it also prevents the off chance that dauntless could be used to extinguish the explosive let's move on to the next fight where my partner has been downed off the spawn and the enemy sets to burning him now bizarrely they then move up over the body rather than guard it and this means that i can see their head because remember that the camera is in your chest so this guy probably thought he was in cover and couldn't see over it but i could see his head pretty exposed and i took the shot now a good reason to take choke bombs of course is that you don't have to expose yourself to stop that burn the second opponent also uses his choke bombs really well knowing that i'm in this building they attempt to choke off the entrances so that they know if i'm going to rush out and if i do rush out i've got all that aim punch from the coffin and that's usually so that they can try and get a revive my signal to go is a close range enemy holding the choke in their hand because that's better than them holding a weapon and i can get that knife rush in it doesn't matter if i'm coughing because the aim punch doesn't really affect the knife that much okay time to move on to fight number four as an enemy team pushes our boss lair i rotate out for a flank but i miss some critical shots and that opens us up for a push and the enemy really starts to dismantle our position we do however notice that one of the enemies is isolating himself so we improvise a little bit of a baiting maneuver he's over extended my partner pulls him back baits him back and then he even lands a hit and this means that i'm sneaking around nearby so i can get a very easy follow-up the enemy then picks up a bounty which unless they were planning to push us aggressively is probably a mistake because we have weapons with decent range and now we can control the distance because we essentially know where they are at all times so as they push up we rotate back and you'll notice that we also turned off the lantern above these ruins and that's to prevent an instant detonation of the yellow barrel under it often there's a barrel here often there's a lantern above it if you ignore that and you're peeking this window and someone shoots the lantern they can instantly blow up a barrel if it's red you die straight away and that's no fun we can now use dark site against them because the bounty tells us which building they're in we know that due to the fire they can only really peak us on the right hand side and we can cover that easily so i'm able to throw in a frag it is surprising how many people don't move nearly early enough they should have started running backwards as soon as i started cooking this was a completely avoidable death i throw a second frag on the off chance they went for an instant revive it didn't pay off here but often it does and it's usually worth a try especially when you can't push in easily to capitalize on a kill teamwork really pays off the ability to sub out and pick up where your partner left off in a fight is invaluable and you want to be able to cover people whilst they heal let's move to our final fight and in this one we've just finished off one trio but another trio has come in and third partied one of my teammates and we are scrambling to readjust after being acquired at one location it's important to move off because you don't want to repeat the same spot when people are looking at it it's pretty lethal however as my teammate engages i feel that they have the attention of the enemy so it's safer for me to approach the window again this time using a frag and that high ground advantage after a kill like this you've really got to capitalize on it especially if you're solo and so i cover the distance between the enemies and their potential revive sure enough they walk into the exposed line of fire i knew i couldn't cover the revive but i could cover the route to it now often i will advocate for clearing the area before reviving reviving is risky and it gets so many people killed but if you can revive safely you should so i can create my own safety by improvising with a fire bomb to block the only route up without using a ladder it's a hellfire so it doesn't last long but lucky i did do this because when i trade this fight is a victory rather than a mutual loss and that brings us to the end of
