all right ladies gentlemen we couldn't get enough last time around so we're doing another minecraft but all the loot drops are randomized except this time instead of the goal being to get to the end where there's no dragon our goal is to summon a wither and defeat it which you know that actually has a pretty good chance of working I feel like given that you summon it directly and it's not auto-generated so okay it's blocked then we're good you can't do anything with that so hey there we go great concrete powder which goes to zip nada nothing and then all right so we're a little recap for anyone who's joining us the first time the whole oh there we go shulker box good the whole idea behind this thing is we have a data pack and the data pack allows us to have randomized every every block breaks something totally different and we don't know what we're gonna get until we actually break the thing it has to be with the corresponding tool though so if it requires a pickaxe to break you have to break it with a pickaxe shovel etc if the resulting thing that it would drop is something that would require silk touch normally it means it will drop nothing unless you hit it with so touch and otherwise yeah let's just open some loop boxes basically sorry Pig oh okay let sound good we got furnaces out of grass oh nice red car oh yeah let's see what dirt is it is the stairs Bert stairs we can break that with our fists oh that's nice oh yeah beacon dude you don't begin don't not that that's like super helpful but I do need to do is I need to uh I need to load up a little document here so we can keep track of this and not overwrite it this time yes please cuz we all know that I didn't do a very good job keeping track of what made yeah we already we beat the wither dude that's it that's it it's over cuz we got the beacons yeah there we go that's it dude we did it say no way oh no buddy way buddy what for just sand no no no no well what is it was I forget your your okay birch birch logs - cactus - wither skull oh my god oh my god there's so literally all we need is soul sand and the ability to survive right yeah this could be a ten minute episode or series Wow Wow okay so you of a skull you two skulls all right all we need is for something to yield and in city loot and then we're good I do have iron oh that gives our papi orange car no I don't think we broke the the stage so you just put those down why Oh does it they don't break right but also all the way through okay oh that's beacon okay all right laughs that was where you were going with that uh I haven't tried birch leaves okay cool anything grass is great concrete powder we knew that how about Wow clay gives us arrows dudes Clay's the skeleton drop oh my god this is just this is this is wild clay goes to skeleton birch good this was made for us this was made for the winner we're basically already there let's see come here cows kill the cow let's just absolute done don't say it it's the monetization or honey monetize the cows okay red sandstone which I don't know if I can punch to death but we can try so far I really I really need something that yields wood yeah something that we can make a a tool or a weapon or I gonna get a hug of some soul my god did you is it really N city is it n city oh my god is a 10 city where is it what is it what Sin City I got three diamonds four

killing these people giving you one there's a brewing stand so we can make pots there's probably a brewing stand in the village because I see the church so um okay and the finding some coops there's sheep over here dude oh if we go into the village there could be some food in the chests is a good chance of that alright thanks for that let's see we got and those it'd be cool if I get a pickaxe from these frickin sheep breath what do you guys mean I have the memory of a spoon come on Oh redstone okay hey that's a that's a good sword right there that's a good oak logs out of these blue

smell or we could make some charcoal wither roses to rock god wait this is dropping also prison ring charge will drop cod and prisoner in shards a guardian it sounds like a K I don't want to wreck a villager no we don't have to yet but it could also it could potentially be what we need it's possible I'm definitely I don't have the health to do monetize a golem one second hey let me catch up real quick on blueberry GG thanks for the the two months George thank you for the sub and hi front page people there's a lot to keep track on this whole thing corn flowers corn flowers are the ones that drop wood yeah there's a creeper we can try that out oh man oh yeah I did the creeper didn't seem to do a great deal but anyway Wow okay I could make charcoal if I really wanted to be smart about it whatever fine creeper gave me / / / stairs yeah yeah that's what I did I just need to get a big ax observer goes to I got I managed to get a pickaxe out of the I know if I just get enough sheep

diamond block that's a possibility okay I have we have exactly nine so between the two of us there's a cat I'm not gonna kill a cat oh I will make an axe though it's probably a good call a bell is a zombie head okay you can break the zombie head though does not anything there's one of the mini mini pots we're never gonna find so sander Hey oh okay you want that bud cool that's fine what me no no no a villager just he just wanted to pick up some stuff that I generated squid turn into an acacia of fence gate we do want to find potentially a silk touch from a sheep somewhere so squid turn into an occasion fence gate which turns into something else which then turns into a bunch of arrows and feathers oh okay cool so we squid squid can be a good Avenue to arrows I don't remember the one you you and I were not just clay clay he's easy oak planks make chests now Oh convenience nothing nothing there thank you for the shelters hmm all right a lot of those dude a lot of those you did the okay so you did the fence how about just a flower pot on its own emeralds we can get out from from stewed and iron and there's some sort of chest that was from Kabul stairs do you have hey there's that there and then iron gold nothing dang it wait dead end is not a thing emerald blocks are thing why are they not showing up I don't know but it's just a 3x3 it just took a second okay and being busted your door down sorry about that dude bong look what I got cool cool you want to see what they do you want to see what they do you go for it okay this is gold block gold block goes to diamonds so it's a blue shell ker that drops a singular diamond alright the chicken cool cool mm-hmm and ever long it just goes to Ray plays Jericho there's nothing we need to find some way to try and get a silk touch just in case just in case the trapdoor nothing that's that and that's that and if we trade the orange cooperate okay so that goes to a smoker isn't the smoker the one that you use to make food yes indeed which you just you just assigned this villager a profession of being a smoker okay thanks yeah well he's being he's a he's a cook now so I kind of you did do for him I mean you know bamboo oh I had a lot of stuff in it okay I got some acacia I've made a lot of logs oh we haven't stripped every kind of wood I don't think either no no no no why are these guys sleeping in these houses I can't

glass panes we didn't I just did the door turns into rotten flesh that's some stuff chiseled stone bricks okay leather pants did we strip birch uh we already did that I did yeah yeah strip oak that's that one we just did okay um did we do a diamond block yet no we didn't have like we had it kind of had diamonds but we didn't have enough diamonds what was it the the squids gave us that we wanted that was through wasn't that arrows at the end of it oh yeah okay so squids to err what's a better source squids or glass glass panes okay ah Spain's definitely the wait here's some salmon the memento um let's see what we all the arrows what's what's we got here well the arrows we could ever need which means I don't need the feathers yeah 600 LT I dunno him on the front page right now anonymous

I've broken a pumpkin yet I'm not sure if I did that okay I don't know what that chest is it looks like dungeon loot [Music] maybe sure I'm sure someone's annoyed at my inability to identify a buried treasure map good what you guys what are you guys eventually leads to totems which actually we could do with black wool from a sheep if we shear the black sheep we'd also get the black carpet which is used in order to do that so there we go wait totems like Toto's one night yeah it's also a fletching table so if we just find fletching tables and villages that works two paths can give us God apples oh really path goes into nether fence which then he turns into some sort of chest this who I did not realize it had that no it's dungeon its dungeon Oh like a okay golden apples ICO can have enchanted books too diamond horse armor what is that enchanted book curse of vanishing that's a sick and chanted book breath seeking chanted book I like it sick bro bro sick bro bro ooh pumpkin seeds though

anything gunpowder I guess if we found sand we could make a TNT pumpkin goes to nothing bone block goes to brick why are you staring at me sir mr. Ritter know which we've already had yeah we've had I've had several redstone although I can't make a redstone block I have six how many oh oh you can make one I can I do all I is what is always bonemeal but you were saying glass panes led to arrows was it by promise no no it's like directly oh that's the frosted glass I see right there redstone block is nothing it's very is much dissapoint

dude Old Town Road boys go watch no that's not the lyrics dude I'm gonna ride my horse to the old Bell toll sorry sorry it's just someone just took a potion oh there's also the yellow paint glass beacon goes to andesite not a lot of that around pink concrete powders nothing but we can turn that frown upside down into actual concrete all right that out dirt I found dirt nice oh you know I can make a bow now which would be good yeah bows might be a good thing we have string yeah that would be a good idea it may go Rex thank you for the five months and you know just to get everyone caught up in case you are tuning in front page or something like that we're playing minecraft and if you're wondering why the heck everything doesn't make sense in this dropping random things we have a data pack that just jumbles up all of the loop drops so that nothing makes sense at all it's fun times really and I'd recommend you try it it's good stuff okay so I'm gonna make a bow give a bow or do you need me to make you one if you wanna make me one that's fine otherwise I can make do okay baby I'm Xuan it's a few thank you torches go to oh also totems for you I forgot about that cyan choker which

help dude here to help I have five bones do you have enough bones to try at bone block I already tried bone block it didn't really yield anything no yield II know and we found flint I don't believe so no but we can always I mean it's easy enough to get to the end regardless or the nether regardless education we've already done that's not helpful sorry I broke your house and your block my dad I made sure to find a guy who wasn't our house that wasn't occupied cuz I was like I'm not gonna be that guy oh I he's no longer a cleric no block in a yellow wool let's let's fight let's do snow snow is freaking diamond blocks last time so who knows snow could be who snows could be so Sam this time dude I'm running over to the snowy mountains that I think you can probably see any see oh there is everything here there's many options for blocks for us to break ravine I'm gonna go into the ravine according to you also a creeper oh man sorry yeah I mean you can't it's hard to avoid I don't I don't blame you it's just it's instinctually instinctual I am wearing the shirt though so you know represent a comma slash store slash CaptainSparklez if you're interested in picking up a creeper ah man shirt which I could say because you were involved with that one and you're right I was everything goes back to acacia logs uh after which you never wanted to work with me again was head yeah it's it is it is the last time guys last one mmm rock on there is there anything else down here it looks like snow is a cobblestone Oh hmm it's not it's not a not useful resource I guess I didn't try what cobblestone is right oh is that I said I don't know what snow is oh no no no no okay so stone goes there yields nothing okay more sheep I need more sheep mate well I feel sheepish I'm looking for sheep can you imagine if we very snowy up here if we one episode of this how wild that would be I feel like our problem was not even a limited yeah well it started it started pretty good oh yeah ringing there's an there's another village over here is it early okay yeah could give us an opportunity to get some more blocks potentially I'm looking I'm looking I'm guessing I'm investigating there's some blocks definitely that I hadn't blocked before black concrete powder gives us some kind of chest that has many I'm over the rain you're always over the rain yeah you better believe it you better believe it oh look your life is over the rain I don't I don't think rain that much because then it means you can't you can't drive fun or you can drive super duper fun if you want you need those fun dry I prefer traction personally not everyone prefers traction though there are plenty of you want to get that drift in you know mmm-hmm just a personal thing you broke a smoker right uh I saw a smoker I don't know if I broke it you try killing a iron golem I did not kind of felt badly about that whole thing yeah I can see that hey this horse can't jump at all or thing there's a block up here that's like a stone fence or something on the stove pipe that I kind of wanted to try Oh give me those arrows man that is a lot of arrows I wonder what that is sorry everybody punching out your windows I'm a great guy these guys are in here just cowering in fear they're like why is this guy breaking into all of our houses these are the most destructive people I've ever met in my life why are they like this why do they hate us so much dude we're just literally peacefully yeah Oh Alexa stop you know I just said that I had to get my own order pizza what do you think it sound like a good call to always be - let's do it dude ordering some pizza up here it's gonna be great good times hey smashing 24 thanks for the tier two sub that's pretty that's pretty sweet dude stick around watch the random stuff hopefully we'll get soul sand oh we should break the beds hey I got obsidian to get to make the portal I mean not that like we couldn't have Hey I mean we've figured it out okay we got it I got a eight obsidian I got eight obsidian from one tulip that that is helpful that's pretty cool hey you know you're diminishing my returns here all right I'm gonna just break the yellow bed and see what happens double jungle wood okay ah Dunkel wood oh hey the iron pressure plate we haven't even broken that yet another words I can do jungle planks from that oh cool yeah so I um I got

drops a brewing sandwich you've already done so anticlimactic hey I need diamonds stuff Jerkins for the cities I sorta had we could combine that and I could get a fire I'm breaking three unbreaking 3 cursive vanishing not good cursive vanishing with nothing else not good do any iron on you by any chance yes I do by chance how much time do you need um just like a snow as much for an anvil yeah yeah I got cool infinity would be good yeah you would be real good actually that is uh so what was it oh shoot what did I say was the chest that drops I was black concrete powder how do we get black concrete powder again I know there was an easy way to do it I'm pretty sure gonna be honest I haven't been recording any of this cuz uh yeah except sometimes I don't it I don't see over right okay that's not what I was gonna say it's not what I was gonna say at all I've never done that I've never done that for anyone who is watching from the front page or the first time I've never over written an important file in my entire life that's never happened analyze also though anvils could drop something wait was that oh that's great concrete powder shoot I knew there was an easy way to get some kind of that looked like it but what is that oh it's gonna cost 17 which I don't have trying to get it you know what we really need is a six might sword that's what we need and then we'll just slice on through that way they're good I have five levels please don't take more than five levels 22 okay that's more than 510 it's less than but it's still one thing okay she gives me what I need it to please how did you get the I don't get one what do you want what do you want to know cooked cooked chicken that was I forget what exactly but it wasn't like an easy source so I didn't like keep it you didn't make you didn't take note yeah no definitely the cornflour was the best source I think although they're not in every biome so the cornflour was wood right not too oh yeah yeah sorry what was the frickin direct what was that shoot something something was a cow yeah I iron block for cooked chicken so that's like that's that's pretty pricey ya know what was it for I can't remember what it was for this stuff oh we got an Enderman yet no oh dude I totally forgot we can actually we can summon the wither right now if we want to you want to do it you want one episode this you want to one episode this we're probably gonna get absolutely go for it do Kiton do it in in the middle of there there let's do it no we can't we have to do it in another okay you want to do that yeah let's just see you know we've gotta just just from start to finish here we go oh god dude you know I kind of want I want to find a few more sheep so that we can get smite that would be helpful and also a few more glass panes would be would be good there's glass panes all over this yeah yeah so let's do that I wanna I would like if possible just get something slightly maybe these have more protection higher prot should be helpful in the nether cursor vanishing is not helpful at all what so did you find soul scent no the nether finds soul sand yeah and then we just we just work it out right yeah do you make you make a good point yeah no I I forgot about it too I forgot about it too in my previous series and then I realized it but then I found soul sand immediately so now could be monetize a villager and see if it does drop anything I'm gonna do it I'm so sorry but I'm sorry dude didn't mean oh are you are you serious freakin seeds drop anvils now what that is huh potatoes potatoes are off Angeles huh that's pretty easy that drops string okay cool cool uh have we unaligned some horses yet no I didn't tame a horse okay you drop a trapdoor and there are the the children are looking at me like what have you done I'm sorry about that dude I can't believe you've done this there's more sheep over here hey diamond leggings potentially that's cool oh don't they're cursed why are they always cursed it's it's minecraft good jobs but it's but everything's cursed yeah there's your there's your title it's cursed minecraft we're bad we're bad no no maybe she's not a bet oh I got a bad

to do we haven't made a hoe and done I have I have done oh I haven't broken the tilt this wheel though that's that's the point as a point that's a sticky piston the random things we get man I guess it's part of being random that's a smithing table she goes to court stairs sandstone right concrete Pat y'all love the red concrete powder because then you go what you go one way you go the other you never know you just don't know if you got to get to one that you put in water and one that you break directly I haven't seen sunflowers those were important at one time they were very much where you

smite yep I have smite 5 fire aspect to on this diamond sword that's that's very good bane of arthropods for I'm breaking three knocked back to sharpness 4 so I can make a smite 5 sharpness for with enough levels you can't combine smite and sharpness oh then I can't do that then that doesn't make any sense and I couldn't do that and why would I think that I could I don't know you're you're silly wow you don't know me mm I just need diamond Lance is that too much to ask I have not found I mean I have won a pair of diamond pants and it's my pair more sheep over here in the swamp there might be

done it I have yeah I didn't yield anything okay cool doing a Blue Orchid which yields mushrooms which yields bamboo yields pressure plates lever red sandstone and nothing I did forget about making the different kind of pressure plates though good thing I threw out the different kinds of wood that was a good idea always throw out everything you find a lily pad see we got and just move on I don't think they gave me anything where are you at just stepping down into the swamp okay having left the plains having found magma blocks well you know if you if you have the smite five uh let's let's just get to the nether I think we can do it it happened yeah okay I mean you know waive your life I've never spawned a wither in the nether so there's no way that this could go poorly get hit that was easy yeah for one arrow all right we're yeah spit I just spent a little while I'm right here right at where the way the beginning of the swamp was we do have totems so that's that's helpful keep the totem in your offhand apples I'm not in my own hand alright so you have obsidian did you did you get more um I have eight obsidian okay well I guess we'll just dig down then find some lava and do it right how are we gonna do that with water in the nether what oh you mean D well we don't know if the obsidian is gonna drop nevermind I'm good I'm good it's fine I was thinking about that all the way through umm what's da Matta do you happen to have was they going to say shoot oh do of the wither skeleton skulls cuz I won oh that was that was birch it was cool that's cuz you put the ones down and you okay so we need to we need to go find some birch real quickly no problem no problem there's birds everywhere just not within sight of anywhere where we're at yeah definitely definitely so let's just find some of the old merch I don't wholly remember where what what the adopt the Obsidian but I know I got to that all out of one so if I did then the beacon me and we'd be able to do that again we still don't have a flint and steel so we'd still have to dig down or find lava on the surface or something like that alright we've not found Flint's got a pufferfish did got a puffy fish where did you come up the hill that was to the north of the swamp yes I just don't see and buy all the pillow hey hey if I yell oh yeah you hear me right yeah yes how it works everyone knows this it is known

head on the ceiling on multiple occasions okay so we need to I always I always forget water like every single time I forget water waste I asked before we literally got here like you know it was close I'm supposed to figure out how they got here how nice lava though nice lava yeah I'm lead as to where we need to go I have an impeccable sense of direction uh-huh or at least a peccable somehow I can't believe you did that so that's so rude dude that's so rude that's so rude for you to do yeah all right basically all right well this I have eight what do we I mean more so yeah you you can do the eight on the bottom I guess here I'll I'll point out I do why not just put the lava down and then six six and eight so just do two like just put the water down just put the water down and we just oh we have to start it did you bring wood are you what no I guess we do right here I did bring what yeah so okay I'll do it here I feel like you're making this harder than it has to be no no wait here okay here so I'm bringing it over one there there okay cool so only thing we should probably do is put a couple I'll put a couple furnaces here just to lock it in so that the water doesn't go everywhere put water down hold on hey can you move my move I just don't want us to push into the lava that's all move I don't know where we go need to Mexico that's all there we go so we do this why are you take the water down take the water down okay I don't mean for it to go that far but anywho I have eight obsidian so I was saying we don't need oh you see the bottom one scotch just put water down me all right all right hey we're chill what everything's fine we're chill he's just like brah I got you I got you okay I did I did a dumb I did a dumb no so just watch just what they're like that or you could have converted them into planks you know so we have more opportunities with it I mean I have let's see if that'll do all right once it burns down in there do it do it are we gonna first try this that'd be sick that never happens we've got gabbles we've got you idiot is it cuz that other Oh Wayne is in oh shoot nope uh let's wait on it here we'll put this one adjacent to it come on come on one of these should do one of these got to do it one of these got to do it yeah we can do both sides double side it's good point good point so do we need to have something burning in the middle I don't like I know we've done this on occasion but oh if you make the wall behind the portal wood it's better that way that is a good work oh well this eventually works no matter what make it I'll make it we'll be there we'll make it we can do it what if what if we get into the nether and it's like netherrack drop drop soul sand it'd be great what are we getting nothing we can't find souls and there's like where is it it's apparently fairly unlikely yet turn around we got to turn around then it'll work [Music] every now and then we portal out it's true we'll watch Portland lights just main thank you for the three months sick Frick Oh Rick what about there mm-hmm how many arrows do you have on you I have 25 okay well hopefully that'll be enough mother Frick oh my guys oh here we go there we go all right you ready oh yeah let's do it go on in I can combine my booties but I don't know that hopefully we don't have to come back because uh huh it's gonna be very difficult okay so we get blue shulker let's just let's just verify it could be you never know two dead coral two watermelon okay nice nice another small watermelon but it could be quartz it could be quartz that drop soul sand it could be you never know or it could just be you get free experience for mining quartz that's all free experience free shipping I do I don't know what that means it did we ever try breaking of someone this someone must know someone mispronouncing fresh avocado what do I think I think it's from I think it's gotta be a skit okay I see soul sand over there okay we could show her box parkour it yeah there's an idea not a very good one but an idea okay oh oh it's fresh avocado I get it free ship a canoe and it was that was one of those it was like it looked innocuous and then one wrong step and you were done for yeah it can be like it do sometimes right close stone Howie I know I was gonna go to Chloe it's right over here probably an easier one to get to do we have a way home listen Rock glowstone drops or a crafting table hey that's handy yeah okay well I guess let's head down to that it's all sand which is always right on the edge of lava shack just up here just see oh there's a there's a quite a bit of soul sand down over here quite a bit over yonder scuse me don't know the best way to get over there follow me follow me as I I haven't carved a soul sand that's gravel oh there's some soul sand okay I'll carve away you're easy to follow you have bright blue dots behind you I leave a trail of breadcrumbs wherever I go yeah yeah you can go down quite a few but the still drop kicks all right so ideally we want to spawn it like further issue away from the lava I don't know if the wither gets mad at Pigman and Pigman get mad at us that's my that's the only thing I've not dealt with because I've actually never done this before hey you know what we're learning okay we're great it's gonna be great just a little bit further for the moment looks like there's a column over here actually okay cool oh and there's a fortress right over there yeah all right surrounded by lava in all directions what could go wrong other than the wither flying over the lava and making it very very difficult for us to fight might as well you know what I believe in us what is uh oh you know it's a nice food in case we need it so nice beef tartare beef tartare all right kick you up that Golden Apple yeah yeah oh I've got it in the hot bar it's it's ready to go that sweet sweet beau okay and my smite five sword your smite five sword is really gonna be the watch your sharpness for at least yeah okay I don't even know if I needed I might have just been able to put the thing down put it down yeah yeah okay well this is my very first nether wither is it for you as well oh yeah yeah definitely all right let's see we've got chiseled quartz out of mushrooms which is noteblocks and okay get ready you ready I'm actually we gotta we gotta dig like a spa man I'm digging spa into the mountainside to your blast zone to be army nope never mind I don't know that I want to do that that that's a little bit close to lava maybe we maybe we do actually we just run this way okay all right you ready get ready to run in this direction with me okay I felt don't worry about it everything's fine all right okay episode one here we go boom okay are the pigs mad at him there he is oh yeah you kind of trapped himself okay never mind he didn't do that cue up an apple okay now he's manic and he's shooting a lot of things in me if you hit him with arrows though for now he'll come back down when he gets below half health or you can try to hit him with swipe if you can God dang I need this Apple again oh how are you yeah oh my what do you know and hit him with stuff okay he is only hitting me Jesus Christ I'm hit plenty of things okay I hit that pigment earlier I've hit him I'm almost out of the brown I'm try try to get it close to him with the right I know he will though once he gets below half health that's how it works there you go Oh Oh God you're bringing him down that's all you needed to do dang I just oh you brought your total total i proc my totem go trying to hit what the heck hold on oh my god I can't get to you anyway just hit him to him [Music] nice nice we had just had my totem proc but then I was able to go Apple it and live it up - this is my post nice stood one episode dang one episode and on the dot one hour on the dot one out wow that's incredible dude it's a lot of us a lot of blue chokers Oh gotta be honest I had a moment where I wasn't the most effective teammate but then I thought you were like around hitting and then I'm like wait you're well what are you doing I'm sorry I thought I thought I was about dead cuz I glanced at the wither and had that moment panic so I stepped back and then I got blasted down like he was just he kind of blew me into where I couldn't get it in don't worry about it good thing you had that smites weed though a good thing we had that totem too ya know I had another one I was gonna pass you if you needed it that that's an episode right there yeah this might this might was a good was a good plan mmhmm yeah it's like a you guys my vibe did you did good that you you looked it up wither is undead so Wow okay cool well thanks everybody for for watching that that was sick um we'll probably do another one because I mean I was not I was expecting this to not be one episode definitely and first wither oh that's that turned about to be a little crazy with all the with everything dropping I will never
