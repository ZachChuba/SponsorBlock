free using the link in the video description here's the problem with HDR displays right now most of them are basically not actually HDR the prevailing opinion out there is that you need to achieve a peak brightness of about a thousand nits to really call something high dynamic range and of course nice deep blacks to go with them because a lot of it is about contrast well all of that changes not today but at some point in the future with the pro art PA 32 UX this is the first display but when it comes out that uses many LED backlighting so they've got a cutaway demo over here showing that they've actually got these little tiny blue LEDs coming through a quantum dot film on an IPS display to help this monitor achieve HDR 10 compliance hlg compliance so that's what the BBC uses and they are apparently working on Dolby as well with a shocking 1,400 nits of peak brightness and a minimum luminance of point zero zero three two point zero zero one knits that is an effective contrast ratio about 300 times what you would normally expect and it all comes down to the over 1000 zones of local dimming now to put that in perspective a really nice full array back light might have about three hundred and eighty zones of local dimming up until now now the i/o is all covered up here but we can use the menu to see what it's got so it's got four hdmi displayport and Thunderbolt 3 which is a nice thing to have for Mac users and be running at 3840 by 2160 60 Hertz with 95% coverage of the DCI p3 colorspace this thing looks absolutely stunning and they're targeting content creators and animators with no ETA for pricing or availability really to speak of I guess they learned their lesson from the 4k 144 Hertz gaming monitor which was delayed for like a year after they said it was going to be coming there now it's good most HDR experiences that I've had have been kind of cool this one looks fantastic also a nice news wanted hurl and we've got the CG 32 which they're billing as a console gaming monitor for KT 60 Hertz I think it's got adaptive sing with free sync which he is actually relevant by the way to console players now and I guess it's got these little pads to put your controller on they've also got a super ultra wide monitor so this is pretty similar to Samsung's model so it's 38 40 by 1080 it's 49 inches and runs out a hundred and forty-four Hertz and then I actually thought this one was a little bit more interesting than those so these portable monitors are getting more and more popular all the time they run off of a single USB type-c connection so that's DisplayPort and power and now they've got a 1080p model that has built-in touch functionality so you can fire up your laptop on a single cable over to your monitor and you've got a full second touch screen that you can just kind of hold up whoop huh I haven't actually practiced this demo but you know there you go that you can fold up and take with you on the go look there we go a couple other notable features here are the 45% coverage of the NTSC color space and the fact that it has a built-in battery bank so it's 7800 milliamp hours meaning that it doesn't have to be a drain on your laptop's battery if you don't want it to be and you've got it charged ahead of time so thanks for checking out our coverage of a Seuss's monitors here at Computex 20 LastPass for free today at the link in the video description so thanks for watching guys you dislike this video can hit that button if you liked it hit like and get subscribed so you don't miss any of our comfy Tex 20:18 videos
