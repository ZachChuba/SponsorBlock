[Music] in the last video we did 150 theaters of blood scored two uniques and a ton of supplies the new net worth estimation is 502 mil we've officially crossed the halfway point to the billion and that is what we're working toward in the last video we went through all of july and we had just entered a new month in the timeline we're now in august of 2020 the beginning of a new era for the account back in my day getting a zammy spear on your iron man was your gateway into high level pvm it seemed like everyone had one on their ironman back then and if there was any god wars item they had it was that one i tried to get one too but this was my xami setup back in the day i did sammy in a time where noted potions for ultimate iron man were non-existent and my best food was cheese potatoes and caramels i wasn't getting five kill trips or four or three or even two most of the time i was averaging one kill a trip two if i was lucky all that aside i really want a zami spear more than ever it's a ridiculously useful item not only absolutely necessary for killing corp later on but it's also needed to make a dragon hunter lance it's an absolute must-have item sitting at a 1 in 127 drop rate i left off at just over 200kc way back when and now i've got better gear better food and a better understanding of the game they will thank you first try greater demon task 151 so that's about 75 sammy kills and it's the first time i get to use the justicious set which is going to be amazing tank armor and the code eye as well actually for blood barraging the minions this is going to be a lot of fun and so much better than the way i used to do it with the kodai slayer helm and occult necklace i'm going gonna have like a billion percent magic damage boost so i should be able to hit like a 44 with blood barrage or something crazy so it's going to be a lot of fun to heal on the minions with that i think i'm just going to leave my salve and spare defender in here if i die at sammy they're gone but it is what it is i'm just gonna try not to die all right i killed my 40 imps which means we're ready to go we're gonna be praying magic and piety because i have melee tank armor and uh yeah let's see how this goes first time in a very very long time first kill down and we walk over here and i just group these guys up i've never actually blood barraged minions but zami with melee is unfortunately a very rng boss i mean you either get smacked like three 40s and three hits or you're not doing the boss correctly you know [Music] yeah i'm not getting this kill that'll be the first trip 220 kc and i finally learned i can auto cast by the way i have a wand now i keep forgetting that been a while since i've opened one of these bad boys uh the blue cavalier is pretty cool though not gonna lie [Music] i mean i am already like pretty close to double the drop rate so spear would be pretty cool like yeah it doesn't feel like i've been here long because it's been so long since the last time i was here blood barrage is insanely clutch here i'm easily extending my trips consistently by like one to two kills [Music] dude i just you gotta love the max cape bro like i wear it to kill the boss i wear it to cook my sharks because i never burn it when i have it on it's the cooking cave program just just max guys really like you're missing out okay this is some good stuff i did nothing but sammy for two days straight and prior to this i had never actually finished a full task at zami but that's exactly what i did not only did i pass double the drop rate for the spear but i was closing in on 300 kill count the sad part is in all 300 of these kills i've only ever gotten one unique drop from this boss actually could have been eight kills but i ran out of anti-poison tragic that was pretty much the full task done 286 kc no spear yet approaching that 300 kc mark uh i mean it's not greater demons but it'll do we'll grab 35 here as a boss task only downside is the minion won't count but off we go task number two please give me a spear we'll be over 300 kc after this one [Music] been a while since i've recorded anything of note honestly but we're 331kc now so we've done like 120 kills since i started about three or four days ago 332 333. okay well not getting this kill at this point but still an amazing trip eight kills should have honestly been nine or ten but uh rng did not come through this [Music] kill no way no way oh my god oh my god yes no way that was the kill i said gf on with the spear out of the way i came to a realization i had three out of the four items required to kill corp it's been a dream of mine for a while to own one of the three spirit shields and all i needed now to solo the boss was a bando's god sword the one in 507 hilt was the only thing that's stopping me i was going to bandos anyway but instead of just seeking the armor i'm here for all of it full bandos is going to be great for a multitude of pvm activities and so is the bgs but most importantly unlocking corp would be a huge step forward you probably wouldn't guess that i'm gearing up for bannos right now but i am doing exactly that melee bandos is old news okay far from the meta these days i haven't really seen anyone but a couple people use this range method and i'm about to try it out we'll see how good it really is it's basically the same as sarah but bandos can actually range you so the way you kite him is a bit different but we're gonna be using a mechanic called range flinching to make this work i did one full bandos task way back in the day so i do have 35 kc to start out with but didn't get anything from that task pretty awesome that i get to use my armadillo crossbow for the first time as well it's going to come in real handy here extra accuracy extra prayer bonus grabbing some black dehyde real quick black dehydrated my first trip at bandus was using this diagonal kiting method which is a far inferior method to the one i used next trip i ended up using something called the six zero range method and even when done at a basic level is actually way better than trying to melee bandos if you don't know what the six to zero part of that is it means that for every full cycle of this method i hit bando six times and he hits me zero times alright so i'm gonna go in for the first time using a new range method so i'm not gonna be using that like five tile diagonal anymore oh a bit rough but we got it in the end first six to zero kill down and i am currently on a german 2200 world so my ping is uh my first two or three trips averaged about five or six kills and i was curious to see just how far the trips could be pushed especially for an ultimate ironman where i'm already down quite a few inventory spaces due to having my supplies and bag on me new day new setup i'm actually bringing three restores instead of four this time four was too many and i also have three stamina pots which could be a bad idea i haven't even broken eight kills yet in a trip and this means i have a max of 12 with 12 doses of stamina but feeling good about the method the only thing that's really holding me back i feel right now is the ping because i just can't find a good world since the dawn of time bandos has been one of the most consistently killed bosses in the game as a result there are almost no free worlds for the boss until i found my sanctuary which was the 2200 total german world that i had 150 ping on but at least it was always free i just got ring of life down dude i am changing this for good i like risking my hp at a certain level and i just cannot do that if i just keep getting teleported out it's nice in certain situations but and the big 50kc there it is grimy snapdragons no no why is it always this one and 60 kc 80 bandos kills down and uh super easter as well i guess i'll juggle those for the time being oh oh no no he arranged me no what is that stack no i'll never know i'll never know what i got dude it's it's just gonna haunt me for the rest of my life well if you ever wonder what all my stuff looks like on the ground uh this is this is it gonna take a small break to do some raids which i wouldn't normally do because i'll have to re-gear for bandos but i'm just kind of feeling it and i'm only doing like five or six so we'll see well here i was excited to make my spear into a hosta for the first time and i don't have barbarian training completed so i'm doing that now trying to get the requirements can i do it oh i can let's go i can actually equip it now yeah look at that thing good luck good luck oh yo congrats on the denny v you know what's awesome is now that i have the hosta i don't need to bring that sammy cape anymore as my zami item and i can use the hosta to get my bandos kc so i'm actually saving two slots here it's pretty sick eventually with the help of staying up very late at night to use the us worlds and learning the method fully i improved a lot not too bad seven kill trip and we passed the 100 kc mark which is pretty sweet hopefully we see our first drop pretty soon yes yes first first actual unique shard or non shard three i mean oh man that feels good dude one shard to go i've been seeing so many shard threes very good trip broke double digits 10 kill trip for the first time [Music] okay now i'm scared oh three run left please kill him oh we have to i have to blow pipe him oh my god what am i doing i'm so greedy for this kill i'm so greedy for this kill please oh my god i actually got it 13 kill trip with a blowpipe face tank to finish it off oh my god oh my god oh my god no way yes yes dude tacit 140kc yes oh my god let's go god damn do i look good i'm so happy i'm so so happy man one out of three of the items i want and damn is it a good one [Music] what gonna put the tacits away for now i'll fangirl over them later i figured i'd attach these two shards as well since i died anyway and i can go put these back in the back saves me an extra slot only missing one shard a shard one to go past 150 kc last kill and we're hoping to get 160 this trip i'm i'm going for the god trip right now okay i brought five staminas into this which means i'm going for at least 16 kills sometimes you have to drink two doses per kill so it ties up my 13 kill trip record but uh it's not looking too good i've got the stamina but not so much the food to make it much further maybe we can pull something out of here though [Music] one stamina dose left 18 kill trip if i get this with one dose of restore and one stamina dose oh my god 18 kill trip holy and i i was out of supplies other than stamina pretty much on kill 13 i have no idea how this happened but uh new record trip 18 kills 20 is definitely possible if you're a regular iron man and you have more space than me as well i think 30 is honestly a doable amount of kills for this method no no shard 2 and 200 bandos casey boom it's been going so fast my trips are getting so much longer and that's not the only milestone we're looking at here wait for it there it is baby 400 million total xp clean clean clean there you are fragrant i'm over here trying to do framinic exiles for this elite clue i have in my inventory i don't actually have to complete the quest but i think i might as well anyway just had to dig on this island and now i have to speak to the candle maker in catherby let's finish this quest first okay you're gonna hit this basilisk for 360 but you're barely going to touch me i know how this goes there we go quest complete i was going to do it after bandos anyway because i want to hunt for the basilisk jaw so now we have that out of the way couldn't complete the master but i got this medium clue done so let's see it okay look at these uniques both uniques that i can store actually i believe wolf mask love a cane banner look at that dude very cool though two storable uniques in the treasure chest we take it okay okay all right all right okay okay we tp that was a bit too risky he was like 5 hp but that would have been 14 kills that was a bit too risky all right hard clue oh my god yes shard one oh my god that is beautiful oh dude that's so nice that's my blade that's my full blade complete and i don't have the hilt yet that's actually ideal scenario oh my god i have so much food on the ground as well this is nuts a pretty rough trip only 11 kills made some mistakes got punched for a 50 at least three times there so i actually cannot store this shard separately into my bag my bag is entirely full right now so i'm gonna get rid of some things i i don't know i have to decide uh there's a lot to get rid of honestly and there it is god sword blade first time ever making one and now all i need is the hilt to attach my friend toby will now be taking away my eternal boots from me it's been a fun ride but i absolutely do not need eternal boots for anything they are truly a useless slot they give some extra magic accuracy i used them for zoro but there's just nothing i need them for anymore not even inferno so 250 kc it is currently 1 30 in the morning here so i'll be doing bandos until probably like 3 30 and we'll see how things go [Music] oh my god oh my god from a minion oh my god no way holy i'm just i'm stunned it's like a one in 16k drop what the hell dude all right i had to do it this has been a dream of mine since i started the account bcp and tacits the iconic look oh man i love it so much man you really feel like a sick account once you have bandos i mean you just can't beat this look with three new pieces added to the arsenal the account really feels like it's getting somewhere on the pvm front in the next video i was looking to get my hands on the bando's hilt and do something that i've wanted to do since 2016. [Music] you
