welcome back to another drive now I know it's been a long time since we've really done a lot of drives around the channel but that's because I've been really really busy with the tutorial series and everything else going on but today what we're gonna be doing is singing if my car can navigate me all the way to the bank I got to go to the bank and that's you know probably 20 minutes we're gonna look at that in a second but we're gonna put an autopilot as we go through the town now we're not gonna go in any freeways we're gonna be going and seeing how well the car responds today with what it has with the updates there are updates that are beyond mine and the one that's coming out really recently that few people have gotten but I'll show you mine is in a second but the goal for today is gonna be Canada take me to Wells Fargo and how many times do I have to interact between now and then but to your drive all right now welcome back now let's get the car all dialed into the navigation for the the bank we're going to so we're gonna we're gonna press we're gonna do all do voice commands so first gonna put on autopilot so that we're safe now I'm going to tell the car where to go so what I'm going to do for those who are new I'm going to press right here what's it going to bring up the voice command I can also press right here but we'll do it right here navigate me to the Wells Fargo in Kent so it says navigating twelve Fargo Kent it gives me two options I'm going to click the one I want and then here we go so we are now going to be fully navigating now what I'm doing because you probably can't see it in your screen is I'm going to be putting my hand on the bottom left hand side of the wheel you need to keep pressure on the wheel if you take your hands off then every 30 seconds and it's not always 30 seconds it kind of varies sometimes it is going to have me touch the wheel to make sure we keep going so what you'll see is a few different things for interaction let's so let's just talk about interaction right now we're autopilot currently is at so I have what is called and I'll just pull it up right as you can see it if you go in the settings on a pilot it says traffic light and stop sign control so what it's going to do is it's going to automatically detect whether there's a stop sign or light ahead of me and it's going to have me in some way indicate that it's okay to go through the light it'll automatically stop for all of them unless I tell it not to even a green light it will go through where it stands now if I don't do one of two things it's hard to go through it one I can tap this down see how they went from red to grey now when these cars go so will the car some of it cars going right now I'm not doing any of the accelerating or anything I'm it's doing all itself or I could have just pressed on the accelerator it would have done the same exact thing would have just gone right through one thing that I will do you'll see me do often is again you'll see me do that to acknowledge going through lights you'll also you'll see the Smiths going faster than the speed limit here because I'm going to be using the accelerator up to about five miles an hour over just to kind of keep going with traffic because right now we were autopilot stands you cannot go more than the speed limit you're on autopilot if that setting is enabled first street lights and stop signs so we're going to be I'm going to be adding that in myself just to kind of you know not be pissing everybody off around me so the car is doing all the slowing down here it's gonna automatically so it really eights here once the car is you know two miles out of its path apparently which you know kind of sucks ed it does that but whatever but it's like look with this light here because I pressed on the accelerator we're gonna go through doesn't matter that it's turning yellow it wouldn't matter if it turned red the fact that I pressed on the accelerator already means that it is going through that light it's already happened so just one thing to be very aware of there so now because I know a lot of you who are new on my channel don't have Tesla in fact I know there's a lot of people that watch these videos who are you know looking to get a Tesla or they got one on order and they're trying to get educated on the Tesla before it comes and you might have watched a video in the past but it's not the same car anymore and so like right there I had to acknowledge that light that crosswalk it was even just a cross I wasn't a regular traffic stop but but when you when you look at a car and you're wondering if it's currently in autopilot there's there's two very distinct ways there's three things that you're seeing are blue right here but they don't all three mean autopilot the one that is the most distinctive feature are these two lines on both sides or you will never see these two lines on your screen if the car is not in Auto five so here's my sign again or I pop up this is stopping for traffic control in five hundred four hundred three hundred feet I'm gonna press this down once that's gonna take that away and we're gonna be able to go through this light up to 45 miles per hour but those two lines on both sides let you know that you're in autopilot okay now you might have heard the term navigate an autopilot you might be wondering well why didn't I say we are navigating an autopilot we are navigating but why didn't I say navigating while in autopilot well that's another version of autopilot if you've paid for the full self Drive package then if you get on to right now when this video is currently being made if you get on to a freeway or interstate of some sort these two lines will turn into one line kind of like you're driving on this line here they look kind of like that except that's the car the arrow and so I'm going to acknowledge the slide again but this time I pressed on the accelerator and and that's how you know you're on navigating autopilot so sometimes there's some confusion on trying to decipher what's a difference of the two you know the main difference just think of it like this but you're navigating on autopilot so that means that the car now knows where you're going because you put in an address into the navigation so it can now navigate you okay and that's what the full soft drive package enables the car to do all on an interstate is to navigate you while you're on autopilot if you haven't paid for that then you'll just be in regular autopilot we're gonna be doing a video on the toriel series soon that will show you you know the difference between those two in a lot bigger way now one thing you're seeing here is it saying that auto speed okay so when I when you might have seen that there's a low notice keeps popping up there I'll make it do it again here it says auto steer restricted to 35 miles an hour by the way that was a great example of the safety feature there you saw that that car turned red right there I had hit the accelerator the cars radar system picked up that it was a little nervous about how fast they were going versus how fast I was accelerating and I didn't like the stopping distances and so it notified me to get my attention and so it makes that nice horn noise that you can't mistake and it works very very well so so that so that's kind of the dirt screen navigate autopilot autopilot when you're looking at the screen the other ways to know if I'm on autopilot is the steering wheel here turns all blue if it's all blue that's how you know okay so we're gonna acknowledge this during this light again by tapping the steering wheel so even though we're stopping here we're stopping not because of the light this time we're stopping because the cars in front of me are stopping so the car is always trying to juggle what am i stopping for am i stopping for the car are we stopping because of the light and so there's two things going on there with this stop and if I hadn't acknowledged the light what would happened was because I'm still far back from the light when these cars started going I would start going again as well but when I got to the light cuz I hadn't acknowledged it like yet it would still stop my car so it's you still got to be you know aware just cuz your car starts going doesn't necessarily mean that you're gonna go through the light but the good news is they always keep the notice on your screen so if you see the notice about the light you know you have any so just do it so one thing to point out here is that you do not need to push the gear stock all the way down there's actually two clicks to this all you really need to do is just a half click down a little bit less abusive on your car and it just you know it's plenty to get the job done you don't have to click it all the way and one thing that's interesting here is I do see keeps popping up telling me about this light here so it lost sight of it and then it brought it back again so actually for this light acknowledged it twice which is something I haven't ever had to do before but I think it's because I got close to a vehicle it was actually pretty high in front of me and it just didn't a sort lost track and again it regained it so what I'm gonna do here again it says 300 feet again I'm just I'm just continually tapping there's a lot of light so we've got two lights right in a row let's see what the car does here we just acknowledged this light what's he gonna do on the next one okay so I got that one too so those those lights are probably 150 feet apart it was really picked those up just fine I hear a lot of people on YouTube talking about that how it doesn't pick them up when they're that close but it definitely did there now I know when they're there are situations where the lights are a lot closer than that together where people have mentioned that they don't do a great job picking them up but you know it did a pretty good job there so I'm gonna take over here because I see these cars I'll stop I don't be stuck an intersection I might have had to swerve but we're not gonna have to so I'll put it back in autopilot now what just happened there was I tried putting it into autopilot and it wouldn't go down a pilot and the reason for that was that is that the car could not see the lines on both side of the road you see how it sees the two lines here and you see a steering wheel if you don't see that you can't put it on a pilot well really just the steering wheel the steering wheel says you can put it on a pilot so right now put it on a pilot and I'm good to go and you couldn't do it before and it couldn't see the lines because there were no lines to see I was at the time in the middle of an intersection and so the car has absolutely no problem going through most intersections as long as you're already in autopilot the car can track the car ahead it can forecast the lines ahead all that stuff it's no problem as long as you're already in autopilot but if you're not in autopilot already if you try to put it in in the middle of an intersection you can't do it so once again this is another example the truck pulls away and I'm going to be acknowledging this light again for the second time and this is some I didn't notice on the first time I drove through that so right now I mean I'm currently on update 2020 dot 16.3 I know that mm I think that's 16 dot 20.5 or something like that is out and a few people have gotten that already very few people but some have I had again I still haven't gotten that yet so maybe there's some bug fixes on there but I didn't notice that on the when I went out the first couple times since the update of course I'm working from home a lot now so I don't drive nearly as much which is again why a lot of these videos are you know not coming out as frequently as they used to but but yeah so it's it's it's really it's really just a little bit a little bit interesting you have to hit it twice so now like that for example we the car the last second recognize we are going underneath of a stoplight for the police station and it's not a stoplight that you would ever stop for unless again it was red but you know most the time yours can be going through those whoops I just had the brake on accident and but again it kind of freaked out they grab the wheel grab the wheel right there when it you know really I really didn't need to but they're still working at all the bugs of this and it doesn't know that that was a fire stop so I think what happened there was that if cars really good at intersections because those were plottable on the map the map knows where intersections are and they put lights there so the car pretty much knows what to do there but that one was recognized by the camera system because that there wasn't there it was not on the map and I had the fire light there on the map it would be my guess let me know what you guys think but that sure is what it seemed like because I didn't see it until like I was going right under it then it all sudden popped up already Elling at me and so I mean again right there it didn't recognize that light and I was right under it but I'd already acknowledged that light 200 300 feet back so there's definitely some issues there with the lighting going through those lights that I didn't recognize before I am curious though if you guys are experiencing that that's three lights now out of the last six where I've had to acknowledge them twice and that time there wasn't even a car in front of me blocking the view so that it's kind of weird let's keep going and see if anything else happens there I also get asked to like you know do you think the car almost hits a lot of those little curbs on the side of the road that stick out for bat and stick about 8 inches and I've never had the car almost hit them but at first I was awkward about everything but you know if you're if you just got a Tesla and and you because I was talking to a lady the other day who had bought one I don't know two three months back and she had never used autopilot yet and they just didn't have confidence in autopilot and they're saying so they I get asked this all the time well how do you get confidence in autopilot and there's only one way to get confidence in anything and that's by doing it you're never gonna watch my videos and and that solely be a reason why you're gonna go and just be like comfortable an autopilot what you need to do is you need to take it off in little chunks and start start by just doing it on the highway for a few sections or no one's around if that's what it takes then work your way into other situations but you're gonna have to do it if you want to get used to it and you'll learn your car you'll learn what's you know awkward for you and what's not I have a lot of trust for the car I've been running tests on autopilot for eight months and in most of them been on camera and I've been in you know weird situations but most of them have been very good so my confidence is really high especially with some of the recent updates so but again me telling you that's not gonna make it better you need to go out and actually spend time in your car just like any kind of thing you want to do to gain that confidence there's there's no way around it you're not you're not gonna watch a certain youtube video that all Sun it's all gonna be different and you're like wow finally watch that video and now I'm good to go nope you've got to go out there and you got to do it and you're gonna love it by the way I just just know what you're doing know what the car is supposed to do that's what these videos are good for is more on the factual side okay go go to know what they're supposed to do and go and test it within those boundaries and you're gonna you're gonna have a great time in your Tesla so anyway you know my my my thought I'm almost to the bank now it's been great I mean I took it out of autopilot twice because I was just kind of doing something with the car at the time showing you guys some stuff but other than that the car would have driven its entire way here with me tis simply telling it to go through lights that's the only thing I did I didn't even change any lanes the whole time I could have I could I could have told the car to change lanes it won't do automatically on its own yet in the city but anyway it was it was a great it was a great ride I did a great job and so and now I get to get to the bank and I'm looking forward to the day when they can do this without me interacting at all with the car I'm gonna acknowledge this light here again the line turns to light gray and we go through so thanks for riding if you guys see on the next one
