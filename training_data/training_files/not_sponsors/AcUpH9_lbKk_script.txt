planet dolan from what happens the bees after sting - what if you woke up a bear from hibernation we answer some of your most burning questions about life how's it going folks I'm per level 1 and I'll be reading sacred Snoopy I'm back and I brought heaps of fruit don't worry and I'm paprika here to tutor my new best friend Snoopy and to help out my dear buddy Pringle over there here's a bucket of fruit to throw up Pringle thanks friend this is my life Nicky Gerald asks what would happen earth only had the season of summer beach weather sunbathing cute swimwear lots of people leave belongings on the sand when they go for a swim perfect to steal it's true I stole all the towels I snagged a wallet I took this guy's life jacket hmm have even have you seen my surfboard no she stole it can I have it back oh I don't suppose either of you stole any superglue there we go Thanks the first only experience summer and no other seasons the planet axis of rotation would need to change significantly the first were struck by something huge that would be enough energy to move the axis as this was rumored to have happened to Uranus once though likely Uranus the extra heat would liquefy the surface and burn off all life so it's not ideal I keep X asked could humans still survive if there was half as much oxygen oh that's not a problem just find someone to finish your breath for you alright so you breathe in and I'll breathe out go [Music] [Applause] you didn't breathe in properly well you took all my breath away so it's your fault hey guys I'm not sure that's how oxygen works it was him he owned all the oxygen what's Dedham it's theoretically possible to leave with half the oxygen but unpleasant human bodies would take time to acclimate to the new oxygen level at first we'd hyperventilate a lot dizziness fainting vomiting and brain injuries large animals might die off cars wouldn't work properly and we need to migrate closer to green areas like rainforests already hardy asked why do some bees died after stinging once it's just natural selection bad bees sting once and then lose the will to live me I've stung people at the end of my tail and I'm always fine this one time i stunk sir hard and the guy's arm came off yeah I was wondering where you got that super cool necklace me too I am also wondering and that yeah some guy he's all grew back don't worry I'm sure that was a very painful experience for him I can make your arm throw fruit too it's mainly the honey bee that dies when steamed and only the females and they're not meant to die in fact the only reason they do is because they stink humans their barbs finger isn't meant for human skin so it gets lodged inside and when she pulls away it rips away her abdomen which disemboweled her and causes death by accident outcast TV ask how did the first person who created the clock know what time it was easy the only reason we have clocks is to show you whether it's lunch or dinner sometimes it's hard to remember what you mail you're out too so that's why we invented clocks like how we invented houses to put our food into exactly speaking of which look at the time it's lunch o'clock paprika would you like some worsted on me ah that's okay I found this piece of carcass just lying around that was my leg oh my gosh really that probably explains why it tastes like Twinkies can someone say Twinkies humans have been able to measure time for many thousands of years through observations and deductions the position of the Sun and stars the change of seasons day becoming night all marked the passage of time you could say that the sundial was the earliest form of clock to exist relying on the position of the Sun to tell time our glasses too were a helpful timekeeping device and some of the earliest clots from ancient Greece were powered by water what and who asked why is it harder to identify people with only their eyes blurred out these souls are in their eyes that's why I like to claw them out if you hide them behind sunglasses nobody will know who you are whenever I put these on I just got my Snoopy to sign off and become a soulless 420 noscope anymore who are you and what did you do with Snoopy you could say she's a shade akka either the fundamental metric to recognizing a person's face the size and position of the eyes is the central landmark of an identity but of course it won't hide you if you have some other defining feature such as colored hair piercings tattoos or deformities iPhone Peaks ask what would happen if you woke up a bear from hibernation that just means it's time for school time to wake up Beth yeah get your lazy butt out of bed you have any idea what time it is at all I'm not gonna drive you you're toast and go to school pronto bear yeah bear bear bears experienced something more like a deep sleep than true hibernation their heart rate slows but their body temperature is high they can also sense intruders so if you wait to bear he will almost certainly wake up and defend its territory teddy adventures ask what would happen to humans at Earth's gravity suddenly turned on that's a flirting it's like swimming but through the sky you have to be careful der drift your foe and you'll end up somewhere bad speaking of which ships Snoopy's and being sucked into a black hole and I'll soon be dead wait are you not going to help her hmm [Music] everything on earth is held down by gravity even the planet's surface itself if gravity disappeared everything not held to the ground like trees or buildings will float off from Earth even the atmosphere would float away without gravity there would be North comments the star asked why does your stomach growl when you're hungry we all have a little dog Oh cat inside of us if you don't keep it fed it will hiss or growl at you most people have dogs there so that's why you'll never hear them hiss mine doesn't do either it makes this other weird noise hey oh you know what that is you a Pringles head oh yeah the growling is caused by gas and air bubbles in your digestive system they're always making noise but the reason you hear them loudly when you haven't eaten is because food in your stomach absorbs some of the sounds is it possible to die from a loud sound yes I can't tell you how many times I've died from a loud noise my phone rang yesterday on a volume and I died I slept my drink and it was so noisy it killed everyone in my house I coughed in a warehouse and it echoed and that made the building explode and it come on me and I died I stretched and my burn craft and it was so loud I died thankfully libraries our clients are usually safe in there hey guys what are you up to dang not again it's entirely possible to die from too much sound if you were to stand next to a jet aircraft taking off without ear protection it would burst your eardrums anything louder or mess with your lungs cause erratic breathing then can make your lungs burst from air pressure or stop your heart from beating amazingly sounds at 240 plus decibels can even make your head explode Lan's lam 24/7 ask why is it harder to breathe when air is blowing in your face this is just like surviving with only half oxygen only this time you're supposed to breathe into their mouth and they inhale nothing can go wrong ready Snoopy boo hmm fishy what the hell happened this is because wind pressure in our nasal canal is moving so fast that it turns into turbulence instead of entering our lungs it bottlenecks in our nostril and creates a sense of obstruction you have to breathe more force relief to allow it to enter your body Pringle you were supposed to look after these two mad I've been trying in the last 10 minutes to learn they're brought down a building antagonized an entire Beach and a bear killed the library full of people nearly died three times they successfully killed and ate you a bunch of times what do you have to say for yourself buddy again you're doing a terrible job Pringle look guys there's no protecting rotisserie your wallet will be the one cooking [Music]
