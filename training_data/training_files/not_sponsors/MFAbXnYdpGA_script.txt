so i have returned to sea of thieves i haven't been in this game since 2019 i heard a lot of great things that the game has really improved so i thought why not give it another try in 2021 and i gotta say been away from the game for that long it really shows a lot has changed and i'm a little bit rusty and um it doesn't go very well much better than that now back to the video all right sarah so as you know um we haven't had the best luck when it comes to cruise we had a bit of a mutiny and my last crew got killed so um unfortunately uh it's just gonna be me and you um you're my last remaining crewmate yeah um i thought about that and i don't know if i could take it so i got somebody else for you are they good yeah they're great where are they ah they're just behind you a ray of hope maybe this new recruit would be the turning point and i could become more rich than ever he horizon who the hell is key horizon well don't don't be mad what who is it just don't be mad who are you you know who it is brennan it's me tiny man i wasn't happy about the recruitment but sometimes as a captain you have to make the best out of a bad situation and i had no other choice all right up on the ship i'm only gonna save this once if you're gonna be on this ship there's a couple of rules you have to listen to okay number one you will refer to me as captain okay you'll do everything i say you will not screw things up okay and just don't just don't be annoying okay that's the main main rule you got it but we both know that everything you just said is never going to happen between me and you okay this relationship will never be fixed okay i'm always i'm done with you i'm you're already pissing me off already you're already pissing me off we got it we've got a quest to do we've got massive booties to collect all right and that's our main focus don't be a prick all right we're gonna be doing a quest called the attempting vault locked by the cautious bucko bets [Music] okay all right all right keep keep put the cat down for two [ __ ] seconds i don't know how i can take it no no in the cannon you go you put it down put it down there we go [Music] sakes okay tony when you go down to the lower deck grab some uh cannons cannonballs and load the cannon and it'd been many years since my last voyage but i was confident that i would once again be successful after all i was yet to fail a quest and i wasn't gonna start now i see the gold there to the left all right cool we're gonna make our way there it's a bit of a detour it's a bit of a detail from where we uh we were headed okay some kind of gold shooting out of the ocean very nice can only be a good thing i would assume all right prepare to drop anchor hold okay drop all right okay yes we're there and see if we can get any gold anything is [Music] so much at the good but i know there's definitely something valuable in there i've got a sloop on the horizon there i see him yeah yeah they ain't gonna mess with us right they don't want that smoke it's underscore captain yeah lovely bring the skull on board i found a cannon i've had a cannonball crate we've got a lot of cannonballs okay bring them up bring them up give me that skull wench let's put it down here in my quarters oh [ __ ] what is that um a reaper's bounty uh we sell it to the reaper and it gives it [ __ ] basically oh okay nice all right we'll put it below deck we don't want to up here we need to go we need to go southeast southeast uh what's there uh the reaper's hideout where we can sell that all right we'll do that first and then we'll go and continue our quest are we on target we're going south the beginning of the voyage was actually quite surprising it was relatively smooth sailing for the most part we had already found quite a bit of treasure and we hadn't even started our quest yet i was happy until then oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] was that uh there's water somewhere on the there's water somewhere i'll just put it underneath sarah plug the holes plug the holes oh robot and [ __ ] yeah grab the piece of wood in the box and then use the wood to uh to plank what has happened now sales [ __ ] i i know exactly what has happened what happened tony took the uh explosive chest that i found and he lit it on fire on purpose and that's what's happened why would you get tiny why would you do that you've done this if you've done this then i'm very what you are experiencing right now is mute me okay sarah he's lying i was on the deck with the captain look at that front sail look at it wait a second let me use ropes to pull the mast up we need ropes where'd you get the ropes from well the only thing that could have happened was that you ran into a barrel in the water no there was one on our ship yeah yeah that probably exploded with the other barrel and exploded tony shut up tell us where we are we're heading the right way or not we got it we got it maybe maybe i'll pull up another barrel maybe we got my fault we got an island ahead of us go south east a little more southeast i'm turning i'm turning oh no was it sabotage or just an honest mistake i wasn't sure however what i did know for sure was that we were now on the back foot just like that if we come across anybody they're just gonna destroy us straight away we've got no [ __ ] cell up front do we pull these ropes do we have any rope no i don't know where you get the ropes from i have no idea right or is rope at itself i got it i'm i'm getting it i'm fixing it sale expert pull it up on it okay you're going south keep going south thank you sarah for actually doing something useful you're welcome she's the one that uh brought the fire barrel in i'm just letting you know what's the same wood i don't need wood i'll get wood i'll get wood i'll get wood okay i got i got some on me i got some on me hurry hurry hurry it's gonna fall pull it up pull it up pull it up pull up pull up pull up oh here okay i get it okay get on the get on the wheel get on the wheel get on the wheel okay now fix it okay repair all right one there we go okay we're secure again my god all right all right this is that's a ghost ship to go ship uh yeah all right hold on look at the map you gotta control the ship you're okay here yeah i'm good i'm good all right okay i'm back all right okay the rip is higher okay go a little bit to the port side there's a ship there ship where at the island now we got a gold skull on us on the map doesn't mean anyone can see us okay get off the wheel i got the wheel prepare for a bombardment on the starboard side sarah i need you on the sails constantly thank you let me have a look on my spyglass is it a sloop no they're they're leaving they're leaving no they're leaving oh they've turned the lights off they're trying to they're trying to stay hidden prepare to drop the anchor raise sails okay tony drop the anchor drop the anchor tony chain lowly anchor low vehicle tony taylor anchor i already i'm already on the left he's the [ __ ] worst ten thousand dollars each 10 000 gold they're not dollars tony 10 000 bucks each month doubloons 10 000 gold was a substantial profit and i was quite happy with it but it was time to refocus our efforts onto the main quest at hand and find the vault of gold all right up in the crow's nest now more to the west we should be getting winning the second sarah it could be that island right there but that looks like it's a populated island it can't be that island surely i think that's the island right there in the distance i believe that's the island all right send the course looks like it's gonna be a northwest direction tony take the wheel all right that's got to be the island there all right tony slightly to the starboard side beautiful okay keep that core skip that course [Music] all right that's the island has to be the island all right tony guide me into the island okay [Music] let's go straight ahead that's where i'm headed all right sarah i need you on the anchor prepare to drop all right ready to drop the anchor all right okay drop anchor drop anchor all right drop banker for back up drop anchor what took you so long i'll go fix the damage captain oh my god we are on the [ __ ] island well it lagged i just wait mutiny no it lags mutiny won't happen again captain oh god pony there's a ship coming right towards us we're with them to our left i told you no you didn't say that [ __ ] tony oh my god no serious we gotta leave raise the ankle right now we're [ __ ] we're [ __ ] we're spotted bottom we can't wait it's just a slew don't swoops can [ __ ] us up when we're stuck we need to move they're firing pony tony [Music] we need to turn we cut we got to move no campbell turn it come on come on rammus firing him i just hit one he's on he's off the ship he's off the ship i'm watching him i'm watching him okay we're climbing [Music] um dropping the anchors drop in there anchor hey they're sinking they're sinking they're sinking we've got to kill them [Music] i'm gonna make sure they can't they can't bring the ship back are you defending tony um i may have crashed oh no [ __ ] i'm coming over to the ship [ __ ] your tony's crashed great okay these ships sunk though we did sink this ship all right good job sarah they're in the water somewhere we didn't kill them i don't believe unless my cannonball destroyed one of them which is possible watch those ladders watch those ladders they could climb up here at any moment yeah the movement i see him i see he's in the water he's in the [ __ ] water he's still alive i saw him i saw for a split second he's under the water i'm gonna get my sniper he's in the water yeah wait wait wait here he comes he's [ __ ] hurt okay one's dead oh sharks sharks get out get out of the water he trapped in the water i'm in the fairy of the damn they'll be there where i don't know i 100 killed one of them the other one i don't know where he is he's uh he was he jumped off the ship i'm pretty sure don't shoot the sharks they're gonna kill him if he's down there uh there's two here now in the ferry of the dam okay that might be them that might be them i think the shark might have killed him i don't know i have an idea hey don't do anything don't no don't do anything yet hold hold i think he's dead i think he's dead i think no i didn't see there's no there's no need there's no need it's not here i was checking okay i think we killed them both okay they're gone they got okay get back to the ship all right uh do they have any did they have anything on their ship no otherwise would have floated to the surface i'm gonna have to go over there because the treasure's over there i want you to shoot me out of the cannon sarah i want you to stay on the ship here and keep going okay i'm gonna try and be as quickly as i [ __ ] quick as i can okay amy towards the island up up up up to the right yep fire me go all right beautiful okay yeah there's something spooky chasing you it's all right it's fine there's this treasure come on baby come to captain verts i'm really close i'm really close it's right here it's right here shovel shovel shovel [Music] there we go i got it what i dug up was a piece of a map that map would lead me to the vault key unfortunately it was only one piece of the puzzle and the particular piece that i dug up was not very helpful but it's not enough of a map for me to figure out where the hell we got to go so show me i'll probably recognize the map i will right click oh you recognize it are you okay cool recognizing it [Music] all right well i don't know where that is yeah no [ __ ] so it was back to the compass this would lead us to another island where we could find another piece of the puzzle and hopefully find out where the vault key was i think it might be pick a room palms this next aren't coming up turn again the crow's nest tell me if you see an island straight ahead i think that's where we've got a head i don't know if that's the island or not this will find out all right we're at pick-a-room palms i've got to find out if this is the island or not get rid of the anchor just in case all right yeah it is it is lower lower perfect well done that's more like it okay i'll be right [Music] back where the [ __ ] do you want me to go [Music] please give the information i require okay i can work this out it went to the ship we got we got it we got it we got it we can get to the vault well not the vault i think it's going to lead us to something that's going to tell us where the vault is this is going to lead us to the vault key all right i'm going to show you the map tony i need you to look for this on the i need to look for this okay right here look oh look at it look at it okay okay i know what that is i know what that is okay look for that island okay i know exactly where that is i know every single island on this [ __ ] map yep at yep all right i'm waiting right yeah i'm looking if you can't find it then we have to get another map piece i don't want to try it i don't know where it is yeah tell me where it is tell me then and where it is so right now let's make one more drink okay i'm done i'm you're the [ __ ] map you're so [ __ ] you're actually the worst it's right there that's got to be it right you never look that's not it that is it that's the iron right there yeah found it straight away you [ __ ] trash pieces are you sure yeah that's it right there so we've got to go right yeah it is it's right okay southwest all right sarah take the wheel for a moment keep this course uh okay i have been i've got the sales yeah it's good well there's no point doing that we're not paying the right way so let me just check i'm going the right way first okay so we gotta go past this island and pass the second arm which is smaller and they'll take us into cannon cove all right hey come down here brandon friend i wanna i wanna make a man's come with me come on mate i will like you once we get the key to the vault that's what i'll like you okay fred i got a princess what's treasure or not come here danny tony don't don't don't annoy me don't do anything stupid please okay i want to make you i'll cook you some pork right all right thank you i appreciate that yeah that's nice that's good now it's nothing long excellent is it ready all right no no no give it like a minute and then i want to make sure it's like tender you know and then um you can have it oh [ __ ] i might have almost done it i'm so sorry what is that is that a ship oh have a look yeah it's a ship all right we're going to engage they're they're they're on the island yeah they're on they're on the island that we have to get we have to go on that island we have to take them out the sales are up so they're not they're over on the ship right now yeah that's good perfect all right okay let me just check the course here ambush them ambush them this is the right island yeah they're on our island we have to get rid of them we cannot go on this arm while they're there all right uh sarah i know you can't get the win right now but just uh tony come down and prepare the cannons on the starboard side i don't see any movement on the island we can like take all the cannons out and put them in the crate up here so we like easily all right get ready all right all right go left go left yeah i am telling them when they're on your side ready drop it all right no no no no no hold it hold wait i didn't know we could do this you can okay go drop it [Music] i'm gonna swim over there and get him captain i want you to keep firing with the cannon get some kind of balls downstairs actually find me fire me over first and then give me some cannonballs go find me [Music] okay they're on the ship they're on the ship i know okay there's one on the ship tony's won the ship with you [ __ ] two on the ship i crashed again with the [ __ ] gun hey you're one of them on this killed i feel one of them on ours yep oh they got chest they got a chest on here so keep an eye out make sure they don't spawn they've got to spell as well nice okay keep firing oh [ __ ] okay this ship is gone this ship's done this ship is so done i [ __ ] it up like 25 counts yeah but they were repairing it's gone now all right this shit's gone coming back maybe we should make sure i want to stay here i'm gonna stay here they can't spawn back if this ship's not here i believe they have chests though this is going to be glorious they drop something on the beach too what they drop oh it's that thing okay never mind oh they got a little they got a little dinghy oh lovely we can add this to our ship look at all that shiny stuff in the water i know i know they've got a lot of [ __ ] coming back with a little boat we can go back and forth to the arm very quickly grab it all put it on the [ __ ] boat more booty was a good thing however having more loot on the ship made us more cautious and much more paranoid i should have grabbed the key right then and there for the vault however we decided to move around the island to avoid anyone seeing us trust me this is not our payday yet we had a big payday coming towards us we're almost there believe in me we're around the backside of this island and hide you would think hiding the ship would be a positive thing however this one simple decision created a chain reaction of events which would put our chances of success into jeopardy oh my god to go ship where where finders oh i'm drunk for this i'm stuck good oh for god's sake [ __ ] that they're not land all right we're gonna fight it uh this ghost ship is gonna probably continue to follow us so what we're going to do is i'm going to do a drive-by i'm going to have you guys shoot me out the cannon to the island i'm going to find the key to the vault and you just have to uh go around the island on the ship okay okay tony you'll take the wheel okay why don't we just take out the ghost ship because it takes like 30 cannonballs i'm not fighting him with 30 cannonballs oh [ __ ] say oh my god oh my god get the win we're leaving we're leaving we're leaving tony first finds the closest outpost right now don't fire on him find the outpost all right [ __ ] [Music] it's a [ __ ] disaster all right let's not let's bank all this [ __ ] ladders right there we should never need we don't even need this boat just grab it and jump off all right thank god uh once you sell that uh see if you can find supplies like planks of wood and stuff and bring it back to the ship i'm gonna check the map to see where this island is we're gonna go back to it to continue the quest oh so that far away oh fantastic it's only south all right right there we're gonna go right there on the left side okay to the south south east yeah this is really fine to me come on come on baby don't let me down now you've been through so much changes all right hey sarah i can't let go of the wheel otherwise it's going to go off course you check the map down below uh yep pretty much heading in the right way just avoiding yeah yeah oh god if i could just turn up in the crow's nest right now i can't see a damn thing out there is there a gap in between that i can go uh between the rock and the island yeah oh god all right the skies are clearing up a little bit all right turn the lanterns off come back up we're finally at the island up in the crow's nest tony keep a lookout because when i stop this ship i'm going only by myself youtube i'm guarding the ship all right prepare to drop anchor i'll go check where the hell i am on this map where are we see a skull all right so it's right there on the beach between two rocks okay yeah grab the grab the skull and get back into the crow's nest again oh my god [Music] there's a ship right there it's right there oh [ __ ] get back to the ship tony they're coming for us god damn it [ __ ] we could be left alone for two seconds raise the anchor oh behind us they're right in front of us the front of the ship you're on the right cannon no no oh i need you to move yeah we're moving go there we got a repair god damn it tony they're shooting ourselves they're shooting ourselves our cells are down ourselves down [ __ ] we need bigger we need better fire keep landing me some repairs i'm going down below to repair i've got no planks which keep landing on him keep landing on him i'm repairing all right i haven't done that much damage keep shooting animals oh we're gonna ram him we're ramming them unfortunately [Music] i can't hit that aisle if we do we got no repairs left like we if they put holes in us we can't [ __ ] repair it with supplies low we could not defend ourselves so i decided to jump into a cannon and hopefully get the key to the vault and get back on the ship and escape sarah take the wheel hit the wheel so i can do this get in the cabin [Music] ship aren't you [Music] oh you idiot you shouldn't do a [ __ ] rook dude i'm not with them i'm not with them i'm not with them you idi i'm not with them i'm they're chasing me too they're chasing me too i'm friendly with you guys i'm friendly with you guys okay we're good jump if you want to team up on them the guys in the sloop that are parked here they're going to help us out get these guys okay we have to just nothing to beat them with just keep going around the island okay just going around the island getting the key yes i'm looking for the k i'll take this there's a crater with 47 cannonballs and 19 [ __ ] planes i'm grabbing it i'm grabbing it i'm gonna go around i'll pick you up yes do that we get this we got all the [ __ ] we need to take them on i'm swimming in the water you gotta see me in the water are they still following yes okay you see me we're going against the wind you see me okay this is

he is now i killed him [Music] i'm gonna put the fire out we did everything wrong and we were out gunned it was very clear that they knew what they were doing and they had all the supplies in the world to fight us until the very end they have to be running out how do they have so many it's actually insane the other swoops completely abandon the fight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
