Now that you made your comeback, how do you feel? [Vroom vroom / Now she's warming up]
Oh, it's only the beginning. [Spoiler alert] [Have you been waiting for me, sommungchis?] [And SOMI's worry]
I want to do it well. [begins] [A fruitful result made out of] [SOMI the artist's blood, sweat, and tear]
We should make a huge turnabout. I'm so tired.. [Working hard for the comeback]
Oh, nice one. [The new beginning of SOMI the artist]
I can't believe it's starting. [Now we begin] [Today is the same as always, THE BLACK LABEL]
This place is called THE BLACK LABEL~ [Preparing to make a comeback / Today she will record her new song]
I came to record today. Hmm? [TEDDY - The owner of THE BLACK LABEL, The composer of many mega-hit songs, He is not being mystic]
Hello~ [Out of the blue]
TEDDY, can you spot anything different on me today? [Something changed?] [I can't afford to get this wrong...] [Huge disappointment]
SOMI: Do you have to inspect me that closely to figure it out? But I used to be good at spotting the changes... [Eureka]
Your hair! -That's it!
-OMG! Oh my god~ What happened to your hair? [SOMI changed her hair color and style]
I completely changed my hairstyle and how can you not notice it? [A cowardly excuses]
I couldn't see you properly because of that. [confused]
-At the very bottom...
-What did you do? Hair dye. -Dye?
-Yup. [I changed my hair for the spring (Proud)]
It's spring after all. Oh, but that's... [speechless] You're joking, right? [LOL it's a prank] [It's an extension lol] [He falls for SOMI's prank a lot lol] Mental breakdown. [Mental breakdown] Mental breakdown! [Now the hard-working TEDDY took the stage] [ Concentrating hard ] [All 10 fingers are on the keyboard today. YEAH] [Pfft]
Ooh, you're so... [Shocked]
Are you picking your nose next to me, while I'm working my butt off? [Haha please] Ooh, maybe I should touch the keyboard~ [Shakes his head] [The jokester of THE BLACK LABEL]
Who will joke around with you other than me? TEDDY: Play the whole thing. Oh... [Shy]
It's a song that SOMI [It's TEDDY's favorite time, listening to SOMI's music]
It's a song I made from an app on my phone [A common CEO who wants to brag his pupil's song before recording]
I was surprised when I listened to it. I never knew SOMI was this hip hop. [Turning on the beat that SOMI composed] [The beat echos through the recording room] [That's my girl SOMI] [She's secretly a composer]
Oh, I have another song called watermelon song. [Our SOMI has another song?]
Urgh, but this is embarrassing. [Vroom vroom]
Turn it on. [A rookie composer is embarrassed to turn on her incomplete song] Come on, turn it on. [Listening carefully] [Enjoy!] [A music that SOMI wrote with her sentiment while preparing the comeback] [This isn't a choreography, she's just being shy] [An emotional summer song "Watermelon" which is ripening with SOMI's unique sense] TEDDY: I think the song is really, really dope. -TEDDY: I think it's a solid song you wrote here.
-Really? Honestly. [The pass necklace that is handed over to SOMI]
-Really?
-Yup. -For real?
-I'm telling you. [That's it for warming up / Now beginning the recording of the title song for comeback]
-Here we go!
-Okay. [Cheer up] TEDDY: Wasn't that perfect? SOMI: I want to do it better. Alright, let's go again. [SOMI is recording the song over and over again until she is content and the song is perfect] TEDDY: Okay, come on out~ [The additional recording was a satisfaction]
Alright. [Having a taste of the title song (In Zion.T version)] [Don't make me angry, SOMI :3]
Are you ruining my vibe? [Now that the recording is done, let's see your dance]
TEDDY: Let's have a look. [TEDDY gives an unexpected check on dance]
-The dance?
-Yeah, let me see. TEDDY: That just now! [Unnecessary movements that are caught in TEDDY's eyes]
The moment when you move without a purpose. TEDDY: Spin around here, and more. TEDDY: When I look at it, it's three times at that moment. TEDDY: The whole second half was bad for me. [Gulp] SOMI: I had a little bit of struggle for the choreography. Why? [Hesitates] Oh, but still... But there's this, TEDDY. SOMI: When I was a trainee, I sucked at dancing. But whenever that happens, [She tells the story that bas been bottled up inside with her]
the trainer used to say I should go there and practice separately. And sometimes they would say are you kidding with us. Then I would [Other people's criticism that hurt SOMI]
just say okay, and stick to the corner to practice alone. So... SOMI: There was a time when I hated getting criticized or getting my name called. SOMI: Well, I know I have to suggest to others that the dancers have to do things and move in a certain way. SOMI: I have to tell the dancers about my opinion, [SOMI was afraid that she might offend someone's feelings]
but if I say something, then they might... - They might feel offended?
- Yes! [A few days ago, during a practice]
You do this while you're walking in.. [Dancers are freely exchanging their opinions on how to revise the choreography]
- Like this?
- Yes, I think that's better. [SOMI stayed silent while the dancers were exchanging opinions]
Then I think this should be better,
rather than we doing this already and doing that again. That's not bad, right? [Hesitant]
SOMI: I think that is way cleaner.. SOMI: The dancers are all older than me, SOMI: and it's... just difficult. -SOMI: But I'm trying my best.
-What does the age have to do with it? TEDDY: But you have to take ownership TEDDY: in your songs, your costumes,
your stages, and your contents, TEDDY: because you're the artist. [TEDDY is giving practical advices to SOMI as a CEO]
I know you are trying to keep everything in focus
including everyone's mood, spirit, and the atmosphere, TEDDY: but no matter how things are going well
between everyone while we're preparing, TEDDY: if something goes wrong just a bit as a result - [Tearful]
- Then that's my lo...
- Then that's your loss. TEDDY: And someone has to say things like,
"We're not on the same page," or "This isn't very good." [SOMI couldn't care for herself while she was putting everyone first]
- Ah, I just care too much.
- So, when you're keeping everyone's feelings on your mind, SOMI: That becomes a burden for me. TEDDY: It's not only you who bears the burden, though. TEDDY: Everyone does, eventually. [Feels sorry]
Why are you crying, by the way? SOMI: Because I've been feeling so heavy in my head. [TEDDY sharply pointed out what she's been feeling heavy about]
I've been keeping this on my mind for a while, because things aren't coming out as I originally thought as -- TEDDY: But you can't tell them? - SOMI: I will try to tell them from now on.
- Yes. [Promise] Ah, I'm so anxious! [Concerned]
Why are you crying!!?? If you ask me why I'm crying, I will cry more. I got it, got it, got it, got it. Don't cry. Don't cry. SOMI: If I have something on
my mind that bothers me, then you.. [Translation: you read my mind so well.]
you tweak something and I go like this. [Misunderstood and frustrated]
Ah, am I not helping you to sort out your worries now? Yes, that's exactly what you're doing. [Translation: you helped me to sort things out.]
SOMI: People don't know I have things on my mind,
because I pretend I'm always in a good mood. [Translation: it's so hard to comfort when SOMI's crying.]
It's really hard for me! [20-year-old SOMI has now changed as of this year]
- The child has now changed.
- Ah, it's so hard for me. I'm going to go off the rails. [Off the rails!] It's just the beginning. [It will be a very difficult path ahead as a professional] SOMI: Today's the day. The day that all of the choreography's being entirely revised! The weather's nice, too. [Clear]
A day like this. Ah, what should I do! [Tearful] Let's bring the fighting spirit to today's practice! I'm almost here at THE BLACK LABEL. [Dance practice room at THE BLACK LABEL / LeeJung the choreographer]
We.. We should.. We should revise it entirely. What? Revise what? SOMI: Our choreography. [SOMI finally brings out what she's been thinking of all along]
- Really?
- Yes. [Back to the starting point.. The choreography's being revised from the beginning]
This, or do you want us
to do this kind of thing together? Ah, I think this will be seen somehow
when we're going like that. [She knows what to say / SOMI had changed after TEDDY's advices]
Not even this, the angle wouldn't be synced. Like this? You just keep head like this in the end. [Tuning up the differences clearly]
Yes! I think that will be way cleaner. [SOMI prudently checks on the next choreography] [SOMI prudently checks on the next choreography] [SOMI prudently checks on the next choreography] [SOMI prudently checks on the next choreography] [SOMI prudently checks on the next choreography] [SOMI prudently checks on the next choreography] [SOMI prudently checks on the next choreography] [SOMI prudently checks on the next choreography]
[SOMI prudently checks on the next choreography] [Pondering on various movements with Teacher LeeJung] [Pondering on various movements with Teacher LeeJung] [Pondering on various movements with Teacher LeeJung] [Pondering on various movements with Teacher LeeJung] When you look at me Do you think it will be better if I do this as well, or? [Worried / It isn't easy to choreograph]
[Worried / It isn't easy to choreograph] [Worried / It isn't easy to choreograph] SOMI: I thought about that, too. [SOMI's choreography note]
SOMI: I thought, 'Do we need
someone to look at us objectively?' [SOMI wants to be reassessed objectively]
If someone can come and look at us with fresh eyes, and say, 'Huh? That's not really good,' 'This needs to be synced more,' 'The angle isn't quite right at here.' SOMI: If we can get that objective opinion and we practice,
I think it will be a bit more effective. We need someone who can objectify us. LeeJung: Who would that be? [Late night at THE BLACK LABEL]
- Hello!
- Hello! You needed me to have a look at you guys. [Lee Jaewook, the head of choreography, came here per SOMI's request]
Hello. [Now's the time to be checked on the choreography they've been practicing all along] Now, as I listen to the song, you can just throw your arm like this, anyway. [Lee Jaewook catches tiny details that everyone missed]
Rather than stopping like this, you can just throw. [The choreography's being revised with fresh ideas] [Points are being visited to be revised later]
I think we should sit in a flash. [Thanks to the advices / The choreography's details are being sorted out] This is way better. I feel so excited. I was really anxious about it! Oh my goodness! [That wraps up today's practice] Good job everyone! Good job today! [Choreography, recording, meetings - a forced march for the upcoming comeback stage] [SOMI is worn out from preparing her comeback stage]
I cried in the car. You didn't know that, right? [Ends up going to the hospital]
I... [Ends up going to the hospital] [SOMI barely speaking]
I thought I was nervous back then. So? [No strength to talk...]
Oh... My head hurts because I'm trying to talk. -Yeah just stay still...
-Yeah I will. SOMI: They said that they will give me the best tonic. EunJeong: SOMI has to get the best one. [Don't be sick SOMI]
Take a rest now. [After getting rest, at THE BLACK LABEL a few days later] -What is the dance that you told me?
-Oh yeah! Yeah. I have my dance. [The second third eye: BLACKPINK main dancer LISA]
SOMI:  You are working as the scary teacher right? [LISA (24)/Very scary in Youth With You 2]
Now SOMI... (Let's look at your dance) [glares]
You must look like this. SOMI: It's the dance for my new song. [So excited] [What does scary teacher LISA think about SOMI's dance...?] LISA: Oh~ It's good! [I won't let it go/Continuously asks for advice]
This is the changed version. Can you see which one is better? [Looking at the modified dance] [Eureka]
-So at the beginning...
-LISA: Can't you make the first verse and the second verse differently? Then run like this at the start? Or... At the start, do the original one [Succeeded upgrading the dance/Problem solved right away]
-The back part...
-Do the back part like this. [LISA is the best]
SOMI: Wow that's good too. LISA: I like the modified dance and the original one too [Brilliant LISA]
so if I were you, I would do the two verses differently. -LISA: The song is so bright...
-Really? LISA: The last song was bright too right? Yeah totally. Totally bright. LISA: It's really good. I hope it comes out soon. -Really?
-Yeah. LISA: When do you film the music video? I want to go to the scene. [Of course]
SOMI: You definitely should come okay? [LISA cheered her up/Anticipating SOMI's comeback stage even more]
-Yeah I'll go there.
-You really should come okay? SOMI: Hello. SOMI: As always, SOMI: I am at THE BLACK LABEL at Mapo-gu. SOMI: Not in my practicing clothes? SOMI: Of course. SOMI: I have something to tell you before I practice. [What SOMI wants to tell the sommungchi (SOMI's fans)] SOMI: I AM SOMI, which you SOMI: really liked [Today is the last episode of I AM SOMI]
is now over. [Sad]
So sad! SOMI: It's over and... [Hesitating] SOMI: Originally, the company's plan was to SOMI: have the comeback by around the end of I AM SOMI. We had all those meetings [Started preparing for SOMI's comeback since last winter]
and prepared the clothing, music videos, the stories and everything. [Time spent so that she can get on stage any time]
Everything was prepared, and we could start right away, but [Bad stuff happened right before the music video shooting]
according to the situation, we can't do that. [The music video shoot was delayed]
We have to be careful because of the corona virus. SOMI: And in the music video story that we thought of SOMI: we thought that it would be hard to shoot in Korea SOMI: and our goal was to shoot perfectly. We can't go abroad right now [Music video filming not going well as planned]
so we got slightly off the plan. [To. sommungchi (SOMI's fans)
I want to show a more] [perfect and professional side of me] "Will it be alright?" "Should I try it one more time?" "I want to do better" [I am pondering and thinking a lot] [SOMI's wish]
I hope I can meet you guys on stage soon. I am so sorry for the sommungchi (SOMI's fans). You guys are so good at waiting. [Thank you for waiting!]
