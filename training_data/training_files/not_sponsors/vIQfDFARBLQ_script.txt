we've all been there you've settled into your groove you got your Doritos and Mountain Dew akimbo you're finally ready to break out a silver in overwatch comp and then you jump on comms and you're greeted by keyboard clattering staticky garbage from that one teammate with a questionable user name and if that's you don't fret because now is your time to ascend to the crisp clean land of good audio and for just about 50 bucks by the way if you value good audio as much as you value privacy you should check out p.i a private Internet access is the VPN that encrypts all of your Internet traffic and uses a safe protected IP it's got a ton of other useful features as well check it out now at the link below [Music] okay so we were playing it up a little bit most people don't have potato head says these days but that's not to say that there aren't tons of options that straight up slap around even a decent all-in-one gaming headset even if it does boast high quality communication and built-in premium noise canceling features because as appealing as all of that sounds in writing in the real world appealing is probably the last word you would use to describe the sounds coming from something like this one but before we get into the microphones it's important to note that unless it's a potato audio is highly subjective so while I might choose one microphone over another one my voice isn't yours my ears aren't yours and it's ultimately up to you to decide what sounds best so I would highly recommend taking advantage of return policies where necessary to try out a couple of different mics to find the best fit our first microphone is the Samson meteorite coming in at 40 bucks a purchase that I actually hesitated on since it completely lacks any mounting options which means it'll likely sit right beside your keyboard other best cheap microphone ups featured it though so we decided to give it a go and my suspicions were immediately confirmed it is literally just a ball with a USB cable so unless you plan on getting creative with your hot glue gun it'll pick up every keyboard clacks bump and a ton of other background noise but wait it gets worse because of how far the mic sits from your face you'll have to pretty much crank the mic game amplifying the issue so I'm not sure why other people are recommending this thing we don't let's move on to something a little more enticing this is the thigh fine K 669 USB microphone aside from its excellent name it sports a nice brushed pink exterior with physical game control on the front unlike our previous mistake and it comes with a stent to keep the mic in a prime position to capture noises from your mouth hole rather than from your keyboard platform but the most amazing thing about this thing is the price it's the least expensive microphone we tested coming in at just 28 dollars less than you might spend on loot boxes in a month if you're one of those people overall sound really good but it's a bit lacking in the noise isolation department so you might want to invest some of the money you saved on a different mount to keep it further away from your keyboard next up we've got a mic from blue yes that blue the one of yeti fame but this one is significantly less expensive the snowball ice comes in at 50 bucks or as low as about $40 on sale and it includes a little plastic tripod with standard threading so that you can use the snowball with a third-party stand it's odd shape though can make it tricky to shock mount without buying their expensive first party solution as for quality though the snowball is very clear with solid noise isolation thanks to its almost entirely foam padded internals however if you have a soft voice you might have some trouble with it as the padding also seems to absorb some of the incoming vocals it does work to the advantage of us squeakers though so uh I'm pretty much like in this one pretty well it's pretty - I'm glad you asked so we tried a few different XLR setups based around Barringer's you foria um two XLR interface at just thirty bucks it might not be glamorous but it's an awesome gateway drug into the XL audio game on the cheap and we're able to do it without using one of these please don't use these now sadly since it's basically impossible to stay under fifty dollars without buying some stuff used or already having a little bit on hand this is a more premium option but if you already have an XLR cable and a micro phone stand you can pick up the XM 8500 also from behringer for just 20 bucks which would have you sitting right at $50 this setup is basically a USB mic killer in any environment thanks to the excellent background noise suppression that dynamic microphones have not to mention but you can easily upgrade this setup in the future with a mic like for sure PG a 48 or SM 48 for $34 and 43 dollars respectively so then what should you buy well if you're looking for the best bang for your buck it's hard to beat the thigh fine k-6 69s sleek design and excellent sound quality at just $28 but if you're rocking Cherry MX blues in your keyboard or if you're a buckling spring aficionado I'd go with the blue snowball or the behringer XLR setup as they both give you exceptional noise isolation just don't buy the meteorite that thing is terrible I'd pick it up you know what I'm gonna pick it up taking it out of the crater to get it cuz it's a meteorite get twenty-five bucks off your bill or towards a new phone so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome get subscribed hit that like button or check out the link to where to buy the stuff that we featured in the video description also link down there's our merch store which has cool shirts it has cool shirts not like this one but cool shirts and our community forum which you should totally join I have been wanting to eat these so bad mmm it's all done not that bye
