hi so chemotherapy uses cytotoxic drugs to destroy cancer cells and cytotoxic means toxic to cells sometimes chemotherapy is used alone to treat some types of cancer but often its use or other treatments such as surgery or radiotherapy and different drugs affect cancer cells in different ways so sometimes a combination of different chemotherapy drugs can be used as each druggist chosen for its different effects so chemotherapy drugs are classified in one of two ways by their cell cycle effects or by their biochemical properties and those in the same biochemical class have a similar mechanism of action so in other words some drugs kill dividing cells by damaging the partisans control center that makes it divide all the drugs interrupt the chemical processes involved in cell division so basically chemotherapy damages cells as they divide so chemotherapy kills cells that are in the process of splitting into two new cells and because cancer cells divide much more often than most normal cells chemotherapy is much more likely to kill them knowing how the drug works is really important in protecting side effects from it this helps doctors decide which drugs are likely to work well together so we've got alkylating agents and alkylating agents keeps itself from reproducing by damaging its DNA these drugs work in all phases of cell cycle are used to treat many different cancers including cancers of the lung breast ovaries as well as Leukemia Lymphoma Hodgkin's multiple myeloma and sarcoma so drugs such as karma Stein and melon are examples of alkylating agents and then we have anti metabolites which are drugs that interfere with DNA and RNA growth by substituting for the normal building blocks of RNA DNA these agents damage cells during the phase when the cell's chromosomes are being copied they are commonly used to treat leukemias cancers of the breast ovary and the intestinal tract methotrexate is a common anti metabolite used for cancers such as breast cancer leukaemia lung cancer lymphoma and osteosarcoma but it can also be used for autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis but even though methotrexate fraud immune diseases is taken in much lower doses and it is for cancer side-effects such as hair loss nausea headaches and skin pigmentation are so common and then we have anti tumour antibiotics but these drugs are not live antibiotics used to treat infections they've worked by changing the DNA inside cancer cells to keep them from growing and multiplying anti tumour antibiotics such as anthrax aleene's can interfere with enzymes involved in copying DNA during the cell cycle and then we also have topoisomerase inhibitors such as a top aside and these drugs interfere with enzymes which help separate the strands of DNA so they can be copied so basically we're blocking this enzyme which separates the DNA strands so they can be covered and mitotic inhibitors such as been Kristin or compounds derived from natural products such as plants they've worked by stopping cells from dividing to form new cells but they can damage cells in all phases by keeping enzymes from making proteins needed for cell reproduction so all these different mechanisms of action can join forces and really get them cancer cells good and the fact that chemotherapy drugs kill dividing cells helps to explain why chemotherapy causes side effects so chemotherapy drugs can't tell the difference between healthy cells that are dividing and cancer cells that are dividing and this means that normal cells are damaged along with the cancer cells and this causes side effects so chemo effects healthy body tissues where the cells are constantly growing and dividing such as your hair which is always growing you're a bone marrow which is constantly producing blood cells your skin and the lining of your digestive system which are constantly renewing themselves so this is why people suffer hair loss when going through chemo and why some feel nauseated or have a higher risk of infection you are at a higher risk of infection as bone marrow as part of your immune system which protects us from infection disease so killing off the salt within your bone marrow isn't the best but the damage to the healthy cells usually doesn't last and most side effects disappear once your treatment is over the cells are only affected as they're dividing so once you take away the medication the cells are able to ride again happily I'd also like to premium subscription to the first 200 people so go check them out and thank you for watching bye [Music]
