so back when i was younger playing runescape i used to watch youtube videos by a guy named oz ltd and after watching his videos for about six months one day i ran into him in game and when i tell you why fanboy'd i [ __ ] fanboyed and to be completely honest it absolutely made my day now that i make youtube videos myself sometimes i'll be in game and someone will come up to me and tell me i'm their favorite youtuber and seeing me made their day now in the position i'm in i have contact with a lot of the biggest youtubers in the runescape community so i came up with an idea i'm gonna walk around the game talk to random people and find out who their favorite youtuber is i'm then going to get in contact with their favorite youtuber and see if they'll come down in game to say hello and potentially make that person's day sponsor hey bud i'm really sorry to hear about you and cassandra how do you even know about me and cassandra we we literally just broke up four minutes ago uh yeah
