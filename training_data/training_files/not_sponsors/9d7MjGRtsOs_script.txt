this video is sponsored by Squarespace dude everybody's using the iPad pro nail artist is I would god Rafi stop listen here there is no such thing as what you need to be a real artist and I'm gonna prove it I'm gonna go online right now and I'm gonna buy the cheapest graphics tablet that I can find and then I'm gonna take a sketch and I'm going to take it to a finished piece of artwork and I'm gonna put this debate to rest once and for all I'm gonna regret this I review tech here tech for creative people and I get a lot of cool expensive toys coming into my office that I get to you so it could be easy to see what I do on a weekly basis and think wow I need the latest greatest graphics and drawing tech in order to make good art but that that's just not true yeah it's great to know how many levels of pressure sensitivity something has or how good a screen is but at the end of the day what it comes down to is skill and practicing that sort of thing and any kind of entry level tablet should be able to do the job right well let's find out by the end of this I'm gonna prove to you that I can be just as mediocre on an inexpensive tablet as I can be on an expensive one I'm probably gonna regret this I have a sketch I chose a sketch that is pretty detailed because I don't want to just draw something really quick and easy I want to draw something that I might use in a comic book page I have a cartoony clean ink style so I'm very particular about the kind of lines that I'm producing with the graphics tablets that I'm using and I'm hopefully gonna be able to show as I go through this video that I can do it on a pretty inexpensive tablet and at the end of the day I'm hoping that the quality of the artwork I produce is gonna be just as good as what I could have produced on my iPad Pro obviously might like losing one better than the other but what we're talking about here is the end product what you're actually able to create with it I don't want this piece to be just okay I want it to be good enough to show in my portfolio fortunately today's sponsor Squarespace makes that super easy I took it for a spin and built a website to showcase my work and they have some really great templates they're so easy to customize they make a great starting point for whatever you want to create I like the fiddle so I really like that I could jump in and get really granular

first purchase of a website or domain okay first I need to find a really cheap tablet I've got it narrowed down to two I found this one it's a little hooey on it is only twenty dollars so I think this is the one that I'm gonna go with ladies and gentlemen I present you with the Huyen oh shoot I was a bad noise Oh Brad alright so I'm back to Amazon it got myself another tablet and I promise you this time I will be careful I promise alright here we go we got am I going to do a full review of this tablet ah you know what here's my review don't slam it against your desk eight out of ten what are we gonna find in the box let's open it up what we have is a nice little thank-you card from hooey on saying thank you for buying this particular product we got a pen which now we have two of these pens so just in case something happens to one you never know and here it goes and gonna be really gentle with you this time this is the hooey on 420 this is the tiniest tablet I have ever seen I am just gonna gently lay you off to the side I might want to get a pillow now the thing to know about these graphics tablets is that they are USB so you're gonna need this USB cable to plug into your computer and what you're gonna do is you're gonna use one of these pens to draw on this tablet and these lines that you draw here are gonna show up on your computer screen in front of you this also comes with some other things mostly these are just the instructions we're gonna have to go online and find the drivers also pen nibs wear out these are tiny I don't know if you can see these let me see if I can zoom in a little focus buddy these are some extra nibs and a little nib replacement thing so we can replace the nibs when our pen wears out so we've got our tablet we've got our pen I I think we're ready to go here [Music] first thing I want to point out here is that I am drawing a Photoshop that is part of Adobe's Creative Cloud suite that's also very expensive it's 50 60 bucks a month if you can't afford that totally understand there are some free applications out there and I would check out one of my videos from a couple of weeks ago where I talked about five free apps that are actually really good like Krita and Metis bet and everything that I'm gonna be doing here I could do in those other applications just as easily now when I look at this drawing the very first thing that really jumped out to me was how hard it was to use this tablet at first because of its size it really took a lot of adjusting on my end to get used to it the live space on the graphics tablet which is the actual area that you're drawing in is 4 inches wide and about 2.2 inches deep it's a little bit bigger than a credit card I'd say about a third bigger than a credit card so that gives you the idea of how small of an area you're drawing it also what you see here is a 15-inch laptop so you're taking something that's four inches wide and you're spreading it to something that's much much bigger so when I draw a line if I draw a tiny little line on this tablet it's gonna come out bigger on the screen above now as I'm getting used to this this led to a lot of inaccuracies that led to a lot of wobbly lines so what I did to offset that is in my drawing program eyes oome the way in that's why you don't see me zooming out a lot of illustrators will tell you hey you should zoom in out so you can see yourself drawing at a real scale I don't think that's bad advice but in this case if you're drawing with something smaller to offset some of the problems you might have doing that zooming in isn't bad at all the other thing that happens on a smaller tablet like this is I found myself drawing with my wrist a lot more instead of using my whole arm because my whole arm was making bigger movements that I wanted to make whereas my wrist and my fingers were giving me more control over the smaller area that I was drawing and again yet another reason for me to zoom in to get those details right and to get better line quality out of this thing and through most of the inking process that was the main thing that I was dealing with in fact by the end of the inking process I was feeling so much more comfortable drawing on this than I was at the beginning where I had wobbly lines I wasn't sure what I was doing and if I had to go back and use this as say import folio piece I would probably erase the first couple they did especially the lines on that character and just redraw that person when you zoom out those lines look fine and actually adds to the character a little bit another thing worth pointing out is this particular tablet since it's the low-end tablet only has 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity a lot of the new stuff that's coming out has way more than that has like 8000 levels of pressure and if you just look at those numbers you might think wow is that enough but I can I can assure you it absolutely is I think pressure sensitivity is probably one of the most overrated stats on drawing equipment today I remember when the original surface pro 3 came out and had the pen with it it only had like a thousand maybe was 500 levels of pressure and honestly even back then so many years ago that was ok so I wouldn't let 2,000 levels of pressure sensitivity dissuade you there was plenty of pressure for what I needed to do [Music] now once I got to the colouring phase I found it to be a lot easier now part of that is at this point I had been using the tablet for a half-hour 45 minutes so I had gotten used to drawing up but the other part of it is with color I just don't have to be as accurate I mean I want a color within the lines but you have the edge of the line to get up to and if I overshoot from time to time which I do in a lot of times especially when I'm coloring in big areas I'm not too worried about it because I know I'm gonna go back in when I fill in some of the other areas and get some of those details just right now overall what I'm doing with this is I'm losing a lot of mid-tone colors even darker colors in some places than I otherwise would've and I'm using a lighter color in the background and when this is all said and done I'm gonna end up going back in and adding a big shadow layer basically creating a new layer drawing in it with all black to create my shadow and then reducing the opacity I don't exactly want it to look like a silhouette perfectly I still want you to be able to see the details but I want to get the benefit of a really strong silhouette with this character and a little critter that he's scanning on the rock by the end of this my hand was pretty tired I found that I'm not used to drawing with my wrist and my finger so much and doing those tiny details I'm used to drawing on the larger screen again another thing that I'd have to get used to and and not clench my pen quite so tight when I'm drawing but overall I am really really happy with how this turned out and I think if I had shown this to an older version of myself from the past I wouldn't know that this wasn't done on an iPad or larger Cintiq tablet I hope that helps to know a lot of you folks are just starting out and you're just trying to get a hold of this digital art thing and some of this can be intimidating and also a little bit confusing at times so I wanted to thank you guys for watching to the end I really appreciate it and I'll see you in a couple of days [Music]
