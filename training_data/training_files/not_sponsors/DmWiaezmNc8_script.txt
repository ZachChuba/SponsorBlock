this video is sponsored by Skillshare when it gets the clinical trial stage in the development process of drugs or medicines there needs to be a control in order to test how effective the substance is at doing the job as made to do so a substance or treatment which is no intended therapeutic value is the control common controls include tablets that are just sugar pills injections using just say line or even pretend surgery the control is a placebo the placebo is made to resemble the medication or therapy which should prevent the control group knowing whether our treatment is active or inactive so what we expect in these trials is that the active substance that we're testing will have an effect on the person either positive or negative and we can check for any side effects with the control as it's a fake treatment we expect nothing to happen as it's not an active substance or at least we don't expect the test subjects to report some other things as those in the active grip clinical trials are often double blinded so that the researchers also do not know which test subjects are receiving the active or a placebo treatment in 1998 the New York Times ran an article about placebos and how they can be a powerful tool in medicine they reported on a case whereby a patient had essentially heals himself through his own thoughts by thinking that he had been given a strong dose of medication when actually the healing serum he had been injected with was just clean water and this is what's known as the placebo effect the placebo effect is essentially response to a placebo has a positive effect on the individual and if we were to go the other way and the individual has a negative effect to the placebo then that is what we call a nocebo effect the nocebo effect is seen mostly where patients are given medication or therapy that has a known potential side effect where they experience the side effects out of expectation so what they say could be true what you don't know can't hurt you even though placebo and nocebo effects are presumably psychogenic they can induce measurable physiological changes in the body the New York Times stated at the time that scientists were learning that much of human perception is based not on information flowing into the brain from the outside world but what the brain based on previous experience expects to happen next the article was updated to include newer studies including one from 2002 which I know isn't really recent but it was published in the new in Journal of Medicine we're 180 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments and either arthroscopic debridement I don't know if I'm saying that Rex is in French or arthroscopic arthroscopic lavage or placebo surgery so scraping out the knee joint washing out the joint or do nothing in the doing nothing group or there doing nothing operation doctors and he said eyes the patient make cuts in the knee as if to insert the usual instruments and then pretended to operate and it was found that two years after surgery patients who underwent the pretend surgery reported the same amount of relief from pain and swelling as those who had the real operations how crazy is that and another study aimed to use a placebo to restore sexual arousal and women who said they were non orgasmic the women were hooked up to a machine that they were told measured their vagina blood flow which was used as an index of arousal they were then shown stimuli that would arouse most women but the folk running study played a little trick on the woman by sending a false feedback signal back without their vagina blood flow had increased when I opened and almost immediately they became genuinely aroused afterwards because they were told that like this scientific fact proves that you're aroused and then that made them brains think that oh my goodness I'm aroused great your brain is crazy man it was also found that placebos are about 55% to 60% as effective as the most active medications like aspirin and codeine for controlling pain and placebos that relieve pain can be blocked for the drug naloxone that also blocks morphine as was found by study carried out in California by dentists in 1978 which I will link below to the main explanation to this placebo effect has been put down to expectancy Theory basically what the brain believes about the immediate future because you have had positive experiences in the past with medications that have relieved pain or water then you have been conditioned into thinking that the next medication or therapy you receive will also kind of work kind of like when someone goes to tickle you when you have that sense of impending doom an uncontrollable urge laughs it's because you have experienced what being tickled is like before so someone just has to go through the motions of going to tickle you to get the same reaction from you because you know what to expect this video is
