hello everybody welcome to another episode of the brain food show attempt door getting started today we've both had some technical changes this week I've switched around my gear daven has switched around his all office yeah and I seen you play in whole setup chain it's nice this is really nice because now I won't have to like take everything down and put everything back when I do different stuff and no wires I'm tripping over everything's just gonna stay exactly where it's at it's gonna be awesome it's pretty henze yeah and you've got one massive advantage in your recording setup over mine yeah which is an American European thing yeah well because you can record all of your video and audio direct into your camera and just let it roll for like the whole hour yeah whereas mine because of some like EU duty restriction so they don't get taxed as like video cameras or whatever they all have to cut out after 29 minutes and 59 seconds because otherwise they become video cameras which apparently makes them more expensive I just rather pay you know what I'm sure is like 1% extra yeah just out the camera that works properly yeah that'd be nice we're continuing today our series on a fascinating origin of everyday things right everyday food but now we're switching devices labeled is part one yeah this one's food origins and we'll come back to some other non-food items but I just wanted to do a food one mix it up a little bit you know at some point we're gonna have to rename our podcast the fascinating origin of things yeah pretty much at this rate at least normal structure quick fact then what everyone Tunes in for a word from our sponsors yeah and then well and they wouldn't be tuning in if we didn't have the sponsors so you know it works out for everyone that's Oh what because we need the money or because the sponsor sponsor just so incredible that's what people want or just you know because you know these take a lot of time and we like to you know get paid sometimes it's nice yeah I know I love getting paid yeah especially when you spend like several days on something it's like it's nice to you know make that worth your while yeah yeah it's true it's like the medium of exchange I have this ongoing joke with my wife about money and it's always like yeah I need to go to the cash machine to get money and I always finish it with to purchase goods and services I don't know why it's just become like a meme screen me and my wife is always like you have to purchase goods and services I don't know why it's less funny when it's not between a couple let's just move on tell me the quick fat weight before we do that we should mention a review contest oh yeah I'm literally not doing my one job if you are if you want to review this podcast wherever you get your podcasts be that iTunes podcast addict stitcher I'm gonna stop naming podcast platforms because I won't remember them all but when we get to a thousand reviews on the US Apple podcast store what are we at now like 500 what 600 yeah something like that it's around there it doesn't really matter when we get to a thousand we're gonna give away a thousand dollar Amazon gift card to someone who has left us a review not just on American iTunes but on the big iTunes is that we will check if you're listening from Rwanda maybe log in under a UK or us account and leave us a review that way because we're probably not gonna check Rwanda 's iTunes Store nothing against Rwanda just so don't imagine we've got many reviews there probably also stitcher and all of those other plans no you don't think I would check but even like even like India what you think we would have liked more but I think India it's just roof it's just a review drew saw the guy who does Oz he finds the saw sponsors who make this podcast bus ask yeah yeah three he gave us five star yeah that works out I feel like I'd be hey Jeff what's up man you ready gave us three stars do starter yeah so please do that we'd appreciate it doesn't have to be a five-star review although it's obviously preferred you can leave us whatever you're fancy and have I done all my duty now or is there something else I'm beginning to know that's good jump into the fence quick fact that's what we're gonna start with so depending on your knowledge of curdled cow excretions you might think that cheddar cheese is supposed to be yellow or orange like that deep is it in Europe is it like that kind of orangish yellow exactly orange yeah yeah okay I wasn't sure if it was still like I assume it's fake right yeah yes wait you are and it started in like Britain was like the big one to start it but so it turns out that of course milk is white so why would the cheddar cheese made from milk why would that suddenly be turn orange like a really deep shade of orange I don't know I want to say food dye but I'm guessing it was originally some other actual reason so they did have a reason but so first before we give into that just cuz it's kind of interesting why is milk white in the first place and it turns out milk is made of about 87 percent water and then 13 percent solids and these are just like fats and proteins and stuff and one of the proteins is casein which is makes up about 80 percent of the proteins in milk and these molecules it ends up they end up repelling each other because their negative electrical charge so they distribute very evenly within the milk just sort of naturally that's why even if the milk just sits there they don't all like settle at the bottom or whatever and then like clump together kiss this sounds like a stupid thing to say but milk is super white yeah like when you look at milk you know you look at a lot of other things like a cup of tea or whatever very few things appear to be you know just so purely white and evenly distributed yeah like I said sounds dumb but milk is weird really why well especially liquids cuz most of the time when you have these solids and liquids so much solids they'll just kind of separating whatever it doesn't really happen in milk too much I mean like if you get like the unpasteurized milk and stuff you'll get like the cream on the top and stuff like that that does happen but in general with this what's you the reason why the proteins kind of stay fairly evenly just really just because of this negative electric electrical charge the casein protein molecules have so just kind of stay even there's derivative distributed and these basically scatter light reflect the light somewhat uniformly through the visual spectrum which then makes of course milk appear white to our eyes and sort of consistently white through the whole thing so coming back to cheddar not is very white yeah how do you get then from that to this oranges color and it turns out in like classically when you're when you have like cows and stuff before the Industrial Revolution basically you know the cows they just be grazing in the field then the farmers go and milk them and everything and grass it turns out is super rich and beta-carotene and so that will then lend some of this beta-carotene of course like you think that carrots or whatever I have a lot of that it's this kind of a warning of course yeah that's immediately what came to mind which actually carrots used to be purple before I think it was the 17th century and then like the years ago yeah and so this was like the Dutch who eventually cultivated there was orange carrots out there but they were like wild carrots and there's different color carrots like that but they cultivated this like orange one that we all know and just sort of became the super popular one thanks to them anyways so lots of beta-carotene is I feel like purple carrots could be like a niche item these days you know did you guys get purple ketchup a while back no when I was a kid there was a purple cat shopper that's weird and it tasted exactly the same it was just died like deep well the interesting thing about that one too is is mustard everyone thinks of mustard is yellow but mustard the actual seeds and when it's in its natural form is not that bright yellow it round right yeah it's sort of a more of a brownish a little bit yellow tinge but we think of it like this bright yellow and that is just dyed they dye it for you know just cosmetic reason said look I suppose maybe it looks awesome with the ketchup you know you got this bright red ketchup and then yellow dye for the muscle but anyways yeah hang on do you call is American mustard in America just mustard because we have a specific American mustard which is that very yellow yes on a hot dog sort of thing yeah that's all that mustard we'll just call that mustard yeah because we have English mustard and we also call it English mustard what it what's the difference because there's like French mustard American mustard you know whole grain mustard all of the different a sure like we call English mustard oh dude whole-grain mustard you've not had this know next time I'm bringing you some whole-grain mustard oh it's like it's the mustard seed and it's kind of got this mustard Lee stuff around it it's awesome if you put it like on a sandwich or like in a hotdog you just spread it on the bread before you put it on oh dude it's legit amazing I will bring you something okay good good all right orange yeah so the grass has lots of beta-carotene in it going back there and so the the pastures the cows would just eat it and whatnot and so this would then get sort of some of the these it would create these like fatty globules that would bind to the proteins and everything and so the bottom line from all of that without getting too technical is then you'd have like a slightly yellowish tinge to the milk like just really like I like a little bit of a subtle golden color which you can think like like a butter but like a really light butter type of look is what this this is sort of a natural with these cows but the problem is is that the where was it um so starting around the sixteenth or seventy oh I should go back before we say that so then when you use so you'd have this like slight golden color and then when you condensed it down you makes the the I've lost my place normally I'd be able to highlight it for you but I'm on my iPad and it's not letting me highlights because or can you see that no okay yeah never mind I can't guide you today the problem see there is I just tried to skip way ahead I shouldn't have done that rennet that's what it's called I can't find my place but it doesn't matter that's the word I was looking for so when you get the so did you get the that you're making the cheese you had the rennet and in the heat and everything and then you make the cheddar and then this will this will ultimately get condensed down the way all squeezed out and everything so it makes that slightly golden color a little bit more golden in the end product but you're still looking at like a mostly white product right in this cheddar cheese but starting around the 16th or 17th century in England some some industrious cheese makers decided to start skimming some of the fat off to make it more a little bit lower a little bit more like mozzarella which has about about half or so it's like 17% or something like that mozzarella has of the fats versus like 32% and cheddar so they just started skimming it off but then making it preparing it just like you do a cheddar and so you started getting these more like lighter less less less slightly golden cheddar and it's still at this point even when I'm talking about that golden color we're not talking about the orange that we're used to today so they would do they would do this but then to then get it back to the color that people expected they would add a little bit of dye and so they would add various pigments in and they might use like carrot juice and whatnot but yeah yeah and marigold petals also is a good way and saffron but what most people ultimately settled on is a really cheap little seed containing pigments it was called a natto I think is how you pronounce that and that will turn your turn turn it like depending on how much you add it'll turn it like slightly yellowish orange a little bit so this is what they did to get it back to the color people expected of the higher fat content ones so they sort of mask that they were just making it you know taking some of the the fat off to sellers like cream and stuff like that so I like that I like that you know everyone today complains about oh you know the foods so fake there's all these artificial colors and stuff and it's like yo this was the 16th 17th century we've been doing this a while yeah that's why you had all those you have those really strict laws and like Britain and stuff about with concerning bread making and stuff because people were to like adding all sorts of things to it to get to cut down on like the flour but still get the weight right like that yeah they were adding all sorts of like weird extra ingredients to kind of bulk it out and then we should probably stop poisoning people wasn't there was like some excise of something super severe penalty yeah like yeah same way like you murder someone or something it was it was crazy and yeah yeah exactly so people were doing this like you say for some time it's my thoughts or its my thoughts on graffiti and tagging like if you just introduced like yeah you know if you're caught graffitiing will just execute you he would drop really quickly and I live in a city that is just ravaged by graffiti like I swear a month will go by they'll repaint the outside of my building and suddenly they'll be graffiti there again and I'm like this kind of sucks so they're always just repainting it's awesome yeah yeah no I don't really believe that people should be executed for graffiti just to make back there yeah I do see why people introduce like super straight especially in the past yeah with who do super strict penalties yeah yeah we're worried so this sort of continued he got the Industrial Revolution happening and they started you know this problem started getting worse and so they just started like gradually over time for marketing reasons apparently people just prefer the orangish yellow they just started getting more orange and yellow like that like a deeper shades for cheddar versus some of the other cheese's which are more white and that just sort of caught on and now is just sort of what people expect but it also in in modern times particularly but especially because the Industrial Revolution it actually they became there was more reason than just like aggro fraud basically is because at a certain point when you have all these cows when you start you know bringing you milk from all sorts of different areas different cows and everything like that if you want a very consistent colored product and and and whatnot you you're mixing this together and then one batch of cheese that you might make might be one color and then you know from a different batch of cows and milk from another area might be a slightly different so to get the get the color all uniform within a brand which people were keen on doing they would just add the make it like a deeper shade as well and that would just ensure that like all the cheese product all their cheddar cheese would look the exact same regardless of what milk was coming in and different different cattle to like Jersey cattle and stuff produced like a richer colored milk and you know depending on what they're eating and then when when particularly start going to the dry fed cattle which in certain times a year that's what they're getting and in some places that's kind of all they feed their cattle then you you'll actually get almost like a pure white cheddar just naturally because there's not they're not really eating much beta-carotene at all and some basically just to keep everything consistent a lot of places will just add this dye to make it like a deep rich color and this is I really think about it I don't think our cheddar is orange I think the cheap cheddar you buy is orange and it's like this deep orange yeah but I'm just thinking now most cheddar that I buy because I like you know the mature cheddar and yeah yeah it's a little bit more expensive and it's white or it's like very light yellow yeah and they might be doing that because nowadays I might not be crazy well no I think when you do age it more it it does but it might be just because it's the more expensive type they might nowadays it's reversed where people think like Oh white cheddar like it's like a premium and also you pay a little more it's less additives and all that yeah yeah but it's really just kind of like if they just you know did it yeah they just did it normally and so yeah specially if they're dry feeding it'll it'll turn like almost completely white my butter manufacturers do this exact same thing if you have like a really like yellowy butter that's definitely they're adding something to that because especially nowadays with like again with the cows that are eating a lot of dry feed and stuff it tends to be very white like like and you know it's still fine it there's a little bit versus like the grass-fed and stuff there is a little bit less of nutritional value and everything but at the same time they can get a more consistent tasting product cuz again if you got this a wide variety of diet depending on region stuff and cattle that can actually change the change the flavor and brands don't like that so they like to try to keep it consistent so if you make sure all the cattle are eating the exact same thing and you know that sort of thing it helps but we love our consistency yeah yeah as humans as a species is that the end of our quickfire is the end of the quick blink it's calm forward slash brain food how was that I saw that not bad that was good although I'm gonna be completely honest for like half of that your video feed cut out and so I just was hoping you didn't ever like try to talk to me and then I just kind of jumped right back in well that's and tried to pick up where we have sown rambling away I didn't want to like you know but yeah so if that happens at any point in this podcast you say something and I completely ignore you it's because of that next next week I think you had some problem with your internet I had a little problem with my my Wi-Fi and not be able to ethanal should we move on yeah I'm sure fearful I've got sick of us talking about our technical troubles they have a back yeah alright so today what are we gonna talk about for our main topic and we are going to talk about Hawaiian pizza and is it called Hawaiian pizza in Europe dude is it ever yeah it's one of my favorite pizzas yeah I know is a controversial statement yeah cuz people are like Hawaiian pizzas weird I feel like that's a meme but Hawaiian well what I feel like you would like it yeah no I bet it's fine I don't see what the what the problem is really there's there are much worse pizzas out there and you know people like what they like you but that's the whole point of pizza is you got this bread which is delicious and cheese and then you just add random stuff although I did have macaroni pizza once and that was disgusting like where people put the cheese and take macaroni on it not not great all right steak pizza from a Domino's or say not good yeah you think steak and pizza and that's how they build it you're like that yep this is great yes my two favorite foods together as one and then it's like yeah the steak was really low quality high fully cooked canned beef or something horrible yeah yeah Domino's that one was that one was really [ __ ] yeah but that's that's that's the point is you could put random stuff in different people like stuff so we're gonna talk how did this get it start so obviously it started before June 8th 2017 but that's a significant date in Hawaiian pizza history because that's when Canadian bread pizza makers Sam panoply he died and so why are we talking about Sam panelist and it turns out this is the guy who invented Hawaiian pizza and so and by the way this he was in Canada at the time so technically Hawaiian pizzas actually Canadian he's serious Canadian yeah so how did he miss you mean there's some relationship to Hawaii yeah so how did he come to invent and then popularize pineapple pizza it turns out mr. panelist was not Canadian himself he was Greek which you might have guessed from his name so him and his two brothers in 1956 at the age of 20 they decided to head on over to America and instead of going to like you know the United States like most people who had to head to the Americas he instead chose Canada for some reason yeah it's like really when you're immigrating not a lot of people think yeah Canada that's where I'm going you know especially around this time you'd think most people would be fake the US but either way they go there and before they screw I have to say I don't know much about this period of history we do yeah that's true it may be it was like now I feel like the further back you go there probably like nowadays but a lot of people I think might be like yeah Canada Canada is pretty awesome got great health care you know all that sort of business either way I think canids is like it's cold I think your mom yes exactly I'll be like you want to know what's nice like California Florida you guys almost tropical weather in some parts of your cup yeah yeah great everything you could want like but I just like us you want to go to that's true whereas Canada is like you got cold and less cold all right you're frozen now so so if you said something I should have responded to that's why I didn't carry I was nothing nothing nothing worth responding to I said nothing I say is worth responding okay so before they before they made it to to Canada they made a pit stop though and which was sort of a significant one because it was where panelists they stopped in Naples Italy and here was where he took his first ever bite of pizza and it was something that had like spaghetti on it sort of like a spaghetti pizza and he didn't he did not like it and but pizza was now record roni beats no no yeah but this is what it was and pizza was now at least on his radar first time he'd ever had it so at this point as you might guess from this pizza wasn't really the delicacy that people think like Naples they think like you know pizza that's where it came from but at this point and this was the 1950s which is just crazy to think pizza as like a staple food item among many parts of the world was not a thing even in the mid 20th century like it was still just sort of this local thing which is just crazy to think about it cuz now it's new bit coders everywhere you know um ie pizza once a week at the minimum yeah this is like buffalo wings - buffalo wings it was like the 1990s before buffalo wings became popular and it's just like really 1990s that is just insane done four wings tonight man friend of mine seven a birthday party this place is this wings night where the wings like half-price gonna eat so many wings it's gonna be great you're not responding to me because you didn't know what I said did you yes just came back all right carry on would you like to repeat that part and then I could respond properly no dude I was literally telling you that I'm going to have chicken wings tonight and it's gonna be great that's that's the level of quality content that I bring to this show but in any event so so pizza is claimed to have been invented in the 18th century but this is sort of a matter of debate because if you actually go back the Persian army in the 5th and 6th century BC they used to like cook they would use their shields and put some flatbread on sort of I cook it in the Sun and then they would cover it like cheese and dates and different things like that and so some people consider well that's kind of like pizza you know you're putting the stuff on so I'm but you know it didn't have tomato sauce obviously because that would not be over there for quite some time so but they put various things on and people have probably been adding you know bread and cheese together since as long as there has been bread and cheese so depending on what your exact definition of pizza is you know that it's debated when it actually invented but if we fast forward to when Mount Vesuvius is levelling Pompeii on August 24 79 AD we have some interesting stuff so that gives us because archaeological excavation of the thing has shown places that had a lot of like things that are consistent with kind of what we use to make pizza today in pizzeria pizzerias so they had restaurants and Sur they had these places there where things like this seem to be made and we even have a cookbook by one marcus gave us a piqué piqué es who has tons of recipes for various flatbread based items food items and one of them most notably here included so he had flatbread with chicken garlic cheese pepper and oil on top of it and that is like I mean that you're all right yeah I'm hungry yeah David sent me an email before you record this one saying eat before hands add a little bit of breakfast yeah it wasn't enough no no I want pizza yeah totally yeah yeah you should try it you should try it like working on these for hours and hours on end so hungry it doesn't matter if you eat cuz then like two hours later you're just hungry again because you're just researching delicious food all the time but so yeah this thing is basically pizza as we think of it today it just doesn't have traditional tomato sauce because that didn't come of course until the 1500s to Europe and that actually when it did initially come there was sort of a lot of people thought it was like poisonous and stuff there was like this rumor thing that it was really bad tomatoes but and this it's it's not really clear why this is the case but it's thought maybe because the tomato is part of the nightshade family and they must have known those are poisonous and yeah and the same thing kind of happened to potatoes and eggplants are the same many peppers are part of the nightshade family tobacco so all these things and something with potatoes they thought they were like sinful or something yeah there we're gonna get into that when we get into the history of french fries but yeah potatoes had its own um controversy in the history of french fries is coming on a future episode of this everyday foods thing because it's really interesting you're just torturing me you're gonna torture me for we yeah pretty much and talking about french fries at 11 o'clock in the morning it's not gonna lead to a healthy lunch no no yeah exactly so bringing us back to maples so they did eventually start using Tomatoes there and so they came up with what is what was known as in a napoletana pizza and this was where they would you just put like a tomato paste on there and once tomatoes in there and you add cheese and then there you have a cheese pizza as we think of it today so that a lot of people think okay that's when pizza was first made despite you know cheese and bread and you know if you don't have the tomato sauce you can still have if you put like a white sauce on there and stuff people still call that pizza so I don't know I think I feel I feel that's a more recent in my at least in terms of my consumption of Pizza tomato pizza tomato based pizza sauce was a thing forever and then like I recently had or you know maybe within the last ten years like cheese sauce instead or like not a cheese sauce like a cream sauce yeah and then you know with onions and stuff yeah that became a thing it's also pizza but tomato sauce is kind of yeah Phyllis I'd like when you came here and we went to that Terra Pizza we didn't have tomatoes no that was chicken bacon ranch that was a ranch sauce and was it so good but it was incredibly good I felt like I was eating about billion count Oh totally like you definitely have a heart attack you ate that like often and you got rot on the side oh yeah a ranch based bacon in like it was the most American experience I've ever had and like a thick layer of cheese it had to be like the most unhealthy thing of all time is so good so good either way so so yeah at the time though when this pizza was at this point in history according to University of Denver history professor dr. Carol hello duskie and she was the author of the book pizza a global history and she notes in there that pizza at this point was kind of like a weekday food is what she calls it was basically just a cheap item you know your cheap flat bread and whatnot that you just dumped a ton of like whatever you got rent lying around so to quote dr. hell's dusky it was a cuisine of scarcity whatever you had you tossed on garlic anchovies and little fish bits yes so what I do like when I make a pizza at home or buy a few like basic ingredients and then I'd be like I got some you know leftover anchovies I got some weird pepper that's probably a bit too shriveled to have in a salad I'll put that on it'll be good yeah you had cheese to anything and like bread bread and cheese it's it's gonna be good but as you can imagine with this sort of random ingredient thing especially a lot of like random fish ingredients and stuff so we have a quote from Samuel Morris which is of Morse code Fame and 1830s and so he was in Naples visiting and he saw some of this pizza being sold on the streets and he notes in disgust a species of most nauseating cake like a piece of bread that had been taken reeking of the sewer all right Morse chill out yeah like I mean maybe it was like rotten fish relating to the code yeah but either way so at this point rotten fish is delicious yeah is rotten fish is what goes into I want to exactly it is and it's so gross when you read how that's made it just sounds so disgusting like you couldn't make it sound it's like why don't we just take the corpses of things and wait till it congeals into this liquid mass and then we'll eat that you know I think they add like brown sugar and stuff though don't they or something like that I can't remember now but yeah why yeah I miss you're not it's not just rotting fish but it is they basically add that readings in there as well put it in barrels and then wait until it makes into a nice yeah yeah yeah it's really good yeah so as you can imagine with this being it was more like a poor people's food for much of history and so the affluent really kind of turned their nose up at it and so this supposedly how did this change and there's a story theory Devery that happened in the late 19th century supposedly happened so 1889 King Umberto and his cousin margarita who also happened to be his wife we're travelling oh yeah traveling the country and they century yeah exactly they were sort of like trying to calm there was lots of talk of revolution and everything so they were trying to wow people you know calm yourself yes so they arrived in Naples I forget how awesome I am yeah exactly they arrived it's your king people's and they supposedly then they've been eating a lot of like french-inspired cuisine which is really rich and everything so supposedly Queen Margherita she wanted just something you know plain something really simple and so she ordered a commoners meal from one Rafael Esposito and he was a pretty famous pizza maker and so he creates this supposedly new concoction concoction of mozzarella tomato sauce and basil on you know flatbread and everything so this was sort of this became known of course isn't Margarito's pizza or pizza margherita and so this is supposedly this happens this 1889 again is the date and this she loved it and then supposedly went on to popularize it among the wealthy and also Esposito himself was then dubbed the father of modern pizza because of this whole story that goes around but is any of this story actually true and the the truth is that this this exact concoction this type of pizza pizza margherita had actually been around long before then so if we go although back to 1849 there's again this is almost like a half-century before we have a Manuel Rocco and he has what is it is mozzarella and he is this exact same thing and he has mozzarella on it though key here is a raid out in a flower shape this is what it said you have to do for the pizza margherita and what's significant about that is that the word for Daisy is it was Margherita and so this is sort of an alternate hypothesis as to how it got its name and this again was like half century before and was this exact same ingredients and everything on there so but if it had been around maybe the Queen really did go and order this pizza from Esposito and maybe this was actually a thing but even if it wasn't named after her and maybe then she did popularize it among the wealthy and in fact what was that do we know what the source of it is or is it just one of those often repeated myths yeah I don't know like stories this well it's actually Esposito's and descendants actually repeat this and you can actually go we will talk about here is there is a letter in the place pizzeria brandy which is still around today which was the his descendants changed the name but so they have it they have a letter from the Queen with the official royal seal on display if you go to this pizzeria and you can see that also we also know officially that Esposito really did receive permission to display the royal seal in his shop and so this is often put as oh that's he definitely did make this pizza and then you know she really did popularize it among the wealthy but if you dig it into the matter more as we do here so Raphael Esposito said it's probably no no he got this permission to display the royal seal in 1871 which is like almost two decades before this supposes the Queen event and for his shop that did not sell pizza but sold wine and so this is when he got the permission for the for the thing so that doesn't quite line up and then the problems with the letter itself so if you look at the letter supposedly written by the Queen in 1889 thanking him for this pizza mm-hmm and everything first if you look at the date on the letter there is no record of such a letter being sent in the palace archives and you might think well maybe they just didn't write it down but if you actually look at the Palace Archives on the very day they wrote down everything like even like the who got paid that day like every correspondent they went in and out and there's no record of that letter ever happening and then if we move on from there the Royal Seal itself if you look very closely at the actual Royal Seal and then the one on the letter they're there they're close they're extremely similar but they're not the same and also on top of that it was clearly stamped on and not printed as was the actual royal correspondence at the time were always printed on so the Eagle Commission's have posted in his shop well this was again he got permission to post the Royal Seal like two decades before this letter supposedly happened so did this letter actually come from the Queen and so the other thing to note here is on top of that it was not on the official stationery used by the Queen at the time and on top of that written on top instead was house of her royal majesty just handwritten in for some reason this was not the way it was done in the official correspondence and so also if you look at letters from the Queen and the handwriting on this one and the general format and a signature they don't match like dude I think you've done it like no pretty sure it's Nuria no there's a smoking gun to all of this it's like nope definitely not real already - yeah no but if you wanted more proof the smoking gun is the person who wrote the letter started it by writing dear mr. Raphael Esposito brandy and brandi was Esposito's wife's name he did not ever use that name himself like ever so why would the Queen address him this way but you know who did use that name it's his brother-in-law's sons who took over the restaurant in 1932 and when they took it over yeah and so when they took it over they did change the name because at the time it had been named a pizzeria of the Queen of Italy but before this whole event with the Queen was supposed to this is just what he called it even before then so that that couldn't have been connected with any Queen visit and when they did they started trying to connect it with you know they did have their famous pizza pizza making uncle and so they they tried to connect it with lots of eminent guests who supposedly went there maybe the Queen did go there who knows at some point so but if they had used the letter of just Esposito's name and not put brandy on it then no one would have known like Esposito who like this is Brandy's right this is a pizzeria brandy what does Esposito have to do with anything so it would appear that they just made up this letter and then they added brandy to make the connection between their current restaurant and the other and then displayed it so as you might expect from this most historians think they're gonna put up a letter in my studio yeah you know from from the queen of the room yeah this is the finest podcast and YouTube studio I've ever seen yeah signed a raw majesty yeah it's about God as much legitimacy as this yeah it seems I mean the letter is super old right I mean it's like almost the century old at this point when the the the eraser in a hundred years this will be even yeah we somehow less fake yeah so the real the real how did the pizza actually go from like a poor people's food to rich people and it just probably it just seems to have happened over time there doesn't seem to be like anything like the Queen being like yeah this is awesome because pizza over time you know you got different types thrown on different types we made some of its really delicious so of course the rich people are going to start liking us you people just realize this is amazing yeah we should all be using this yeah it's candy you can carry it around on the go and like oh there's all sorts and it's quick to make yeah it's awesome so so eventually cheap as well yeah super cheap although I suppose if you original doesn't matter yeah yeah but it's still nice it is nice you feel like you're getting a good deal yeah we never like feeding lots of people I mean that's like what one of the things pizzas good for us so so in the dawn of the 20th century pizza didn't make its way over to North America but it wasn't really popular at this point it wasn't like a really a thing and so until the 1950s it started to become a little more noticeable like the Italian American community would would pizza was a thing but outside of that it really wasn't a thing in North America and so this sort of started to change so you have like Harry Harry Warren and Jack Brooks 1952 song sung by Dean Martin called that's amore it was in the Caddy the 1953 film Katti so it's got that you know moon hit your eye like a big pizza pie and so this this at the time like we think of that now we all understand that lyric but oh I know that song yeah yeah but at the time people thought for people listening or practicing it's a pie you know like what's that you know but well I feel like that's what they call pizza in old movies don't they gonna have a pizza pie I mean okay I assume you just mean pizza but you know in the past yeah you cut out again so if you said something yeah no I see I'm saying I did because I was being incredibly entertaining if ever I just stopped responding you should just keep talking so yeah we're worried yes so this 1950s it's sort of like a like starting to become peripherally like something the American people are starting to realize is the thing but not really popular anywhere so this all brings us back to Sam panoply and Hawaiian pizza so he's arriving in Ontario in a town called Chatham I'm gonna guess it's pronounced Chatham and it's about an hour's drive definitely say Chatham that I don't know yeah it's probably named off to chance him in the UK okay close to where I grew up it's kind of rough in Chatham but I don't know maybe in Canada to change the name yeah now I'm sure you're probably the pronunciation yeah you're probably right though but either way it's a it's miss about an hour's drive from the US Michigan border so in 1956 they go there they open a diner on him and his brothers and they call it it's called the satellite it's still there actually but not a different management obviously and so this way they kind of made some interesting really also yeah they way any died reason 17 yeah it could have been like his kids or something but no no he ants he sold it in like the 1970s but um either way so at the time he had a rather eclectic they decided to go with so instead of like serving what anyone else would serve they serve things like Chinese food which I mean nowadays would be common but at the time wasn't really a thing too much outside of like Chinese communities obviously it wasn't like a popular thing so the Chinese food but alongside Chinese food they're serving burgers and they're serving Spanish rice with fried eggs and then various random Greek delicacies and then also pizza so it's just like this completely random like it was stuff seemingly specifically chosen because it was stuff that no one else served you know around and the reason and so he actually talks about it in an interview in 2015 with atlas obscura which is a great website people should check out um he talks about via it's just like a pizza at the time there was no we're like the Windsor or Detroit was about the closest place you could get pizza which is about 50 miles away from his restaurant so he describes this here the pizza in Canada in those days was primitive you know dough sauce cheese and mushroom bacon or pepperoni that was it you have no choices you get one of three toppings or more of them together dude this is killing me ah I feel I feel like I need to get on uber eats and order a pizza right now yeah probably there around the time we get down here so yeah so again he's attempting to distinguish just fares so he goes ahead and serves customers pizza with things like Vienna sausage rice olives rice really on pizza but yeah he's throwing random stuff on here basically just kind of whatever insurer does already bad right yeah and so it's just throwing lots of random stuff it's the sort of a weird restaurant how does this restaurant survive it's like let's serve stuff that no one's ever heard of like is it around today in this I assume I assume not I assume I don't know apparently it's still there things out yeah so in 1962 he decides to experiment further and he puts pineapple and ham on a pizza and calls it the Hawaiian which pineapple is he says it was named after just the brand of canned pineapple that he is there was a it was just Hawaiian pineapple from that was a label on the can so he just called it Y in pizza cuz he's putting it on his pizza as for the inspiration he notes those days nobody was mixing sweets and sounds and all that the only sweet and sour thing you would get as Chinese pork you know with the sweet and sour sauce other there was no mix this is also so good sweet-and-sour Chinese ah yeah and so he is serving I might order two things from rebreathe he is serving Chinese food are there so he get you know that's sort of his his thing so I'm so with the credits of the pizza he stated we just put it on just with one of it see how it was going to taste we were young in the business my computer decide to have a lot of a stroke while I was reading that did you see it can you continue that I've gone I've jumped up like six pages oh sorry we were young in the business and we were doing a lot of experiments wait I just read it what's up is there not correct I'm gonna read it again but I think that's because I think I haven't ready even though I definitely have we just put it on this is the fun of it yeah it's gonna taste we're just young in the business and we were doing a lot of experiments third time's the charm yes yeah I heard that one okay great the audience said it three times so yeah it probably also helped I could see your face if you're just waiting there for me waiting for me to read it and I'm like dude I just read someone did message us I'll put a comment on YouTube the other day being like you guys aren't in the same room and I was like wow really yes I know even though that's like completely different though I don't know yeah straight either way so 19 feet he was probably also he doesn't mention this but if you look at the 1950s 1960s what was happening around that time was the Americanized version of Tiki culture was just like sweeping through North America and it was it was primarily spurred by all the people coming back from like the Pacific Theater World War 2 and so they were had all this like you know bringing like the barrels of rum girls and hula hula skirts and tiki torches and all that was like a thing that was like a major thing being you know popular so this could have also possibly helped him helped him sort of inspire to make like a Hawaiian pizza it's noteworthy here so this Tiki culture thing to us is like yeah Tiki Tiki right like tiki torches that's just fun but this is actually kind of considered pretty culturally offensive to a lot of people because you have like it's basically as one person put it what did they put like so it would be like equivalent if you had fruity alcoholic beverages complete with umbrellas and cross stars that's clot cross draws all serve drinking glasses made in shape if Jesus and Mohammed's head and then maybe throw in some Buddha statues and then calling it Jewish culture so it's basically I'm ok with that yeah but then I'm not any of these religions yeah I guess that's why I'm ok with that sort of the analogous to what the tiki bars do you know like it's just yeah either way people people some people don't like that but in any event regardless of anyone's feelings fair enough yeah so in the 1950 this was super like this made pineapples started to become very popular and I'm thinking like a Jesus head cup would be pretty cool yeah I'm sure yeah that one I think people wouldn't get as offended but try having like a Mohammed Cup you know what I think you'd have more of they have all these of a backlash not from like mother Lanka like and they had all these things at the airport saying like Buddha is not decoration so don't buy oh yeah good Buddha statue decoration yeah okay but wouldn't be if you had a Buddha statue I don't feel like anyone's gonna get like super upset at you because it's like the whole all they will they're they were like they was pretty like big signs everywhere I mean I don't think anyone's gonna you know do anything to you have like a Buddha statue in your yeah I knees restaurants or whatever yeah yeah no but you can you can sort of see the the the issue with some people have it be either way I get it I get it either way so you get 1950s pineapples are starting to become very popular in all this and so he could you know you can see how maybe that was part of his inspiration for the Hawaiian pizza and whether whether that's was sort of some of his thought process to capitalize on the sort of the trend going on he he did it and then he noted when it debuted nobody liked it at first but after that they went crazy about it yes so it did catch on you want me to read that two more times yeah so nobody liked it okay so they yeah it did get John all over the place after that and just kind of spread from there and became quite ubiquitous a few decades later so an interesting aside here so moving on from there so pineapples pineapples super cheap you just throw it on the pizza nobody thinks like it doesn't add cost it's not like you're paying like a hundred bucks for a pineapple pizza compared to the other types but it turns out in the sixth between the 16th and 18th centuries this was pineapple was like insanely expensive and there's no good way to like really translate like for that gap and then like different regions and stuff like how expensive wasn't but generally like when you look at the general ballpark and like to look at inflation and all that it's like five to ten thousand dollars per pineapple with what people were basically paying for these things and reason being it turns out pineapples are really really hard to grow outside of their native environment that tropical environment so when Christopher Columbus sees the first one to bring it back in 1493 to Europe they tried to cultivate it and you know grow new ones and just universally failed no one could do it and so you had to import it then from the Americas but the problem is it's a fruit right and so if you want to import it and it's sort of like normal you pick it off the the plant form you end up having to get it back really quick and kind of keep it new so it can't be too hot and stuff like that and the ships and stuff like that are just rot and stuff like that so you need really good weather and a really fast ship to get it back in time to it'd be like consumable in that form like they can obviously do other forms like a bit and everything but for that people rule like today eat local and all this stuff it's like the guys back in the day they were like quicksand my fast asleep bring me bring me some pineapple yeah and yeah exactly so you had as you can imagine from this you had to be 17 people died bringing you this pineapple my leash worth it probably legit said stuff like that oh yeah cos sugar and sweet things like that were really expensive you know and this is like pineapple is super sweet and kind of unique tasting in a lot of ways you don't really get a lot of different fruits that taste like that or things you make so yeah you have to be like a super super wealthy to to to get it but then the Dutch figured out in the late 17th century the Dutch finally figured out and it's not like Agnes block is this woman she is considered to be the first to actually figure out how to cultivate some pineapple in 1687 so but there was some other plants that people had done but people thought it was actually brought from like a juvenile plant and then they just managed to keep it alive and everything but either way around this time 11th late 17th century they come up with this so the more documented one is this Dutch cloth merchant by the name of Peter de la corte who he came up with a way to grow pineapples in a non tropical climate consistently and so what he did is he utilized all these different hot rooms consistently so yeah basically had to keep it really warm and humid but not too hot and not too cold and not the air you had to keep the the soil temperature a certain within a very specific range or the pineapple would die and the problem with this was of course you know using fires and stuff to keep a consistent temperature you know you had to constantly be adjusting it based on the ambient temperature and get everything so it was like not easy and you got to get that left light to you for the thing to grow in the first place and so basically what ended up happening is people killing the plants with smoke it was a common thing and then just burning down the hot room building was also a pretty common thing so it was still super expensive but now you didn't have to be like a king to get it now you could just be like a really wealthy merchant you know to get a hold of a pineapple in some regions so so yeah so what ended up happening is then the lots of different courts from around particularly like in England would send people to the Netherlands to learn how to make these things and so we come back to the to England and even then it took until seventeen fourteen to seventeen sixteen around then before someone actually successfully managed to grow a pineapple in England so this was a you know a couple decades later and it seems today they're all just grown in the tropics right and then put on big ships yeah you probably better cooling yeah you would probably I would guess but you know because I can't imagine there's like many of these yeah like magical hot rooms in England growing pineapple yeah especially because they just make it so expensive versus just putting on a big shipping container like you say and getting cuz you can't get it over faster to you in that way but um yeah presumably so yeah so there's a Dutchman called Henry to lend a he was the one that first did it it managed it in England and he was working for a guy named Matthew Dekker and so he his first doing of this like his first managed to cultivate the the pineapple here they actually commissioned the painting to commemorate it in 1720 which and if you look if anyone's ever noticed if you go back to a lot of these classic paintings from this era they were pictures of pineapples it was like a thing there would just be like random like oh there's a pineapple and it's cuz there's this just like extreme like like flecks of wealth like yeah I got a pineapple big deal and so hell yeah so you just put it in your paintings like in the background yeah it's just the pineapple sitting on a shelf no big deal also if you are if you walk around London you'll see on staircases and stuff you know at the end of it you might have like an object often is the pineapple yeah because it was like so insanely valuable and rare and everything so even then so you got telling this guy's method so to sort of illustrate how complicated this was so yes this pineapple laughs yeah so you next episode was gonna pineapple and just sitting on this in the background like maybe even just in the trash you know just like sticking out of the trash like whatever I don't need that pineapple just casually snacking on it so you have these hot houses that he made so he would have these tamp it's lined with pebbles and then on top of the pebbles he would place manure and then on top of that he would have Tanner's bark which you would put which was oak bark soaked in water and then on top of that he would put a pot containing the the pineapple plant with some soil and everything so the manure itself the problem was was too hot you know kept things too hot so the the Tanners part kind of helped regulate it and even it out and everything and then that this method that he came up with would keep it reasonably consistent everything for temperatures so even even with even with this as you can imagine it was still really hard to get a hold of pineapple but it was possible now you could do it and so it became sort of an ornament at parties and everything so like to the point where a lot of people you know maybe you want to bring a pineapple to a party you can't afford to actually buy the pineapple so people started renting the pineapples out so they'd rent it out for like a week you know just and you'd rent it for a few hours at a time like just go carry a pineapple to a party or you know you just got it on display no one's allowed to eat it you know look at it touch it you know stuff like that we can't eat it cuz you're just renting it you're not and then eventually when it got you know close to being fully ripe and everything doesn't carry with rounds at this party yeah set it on a shelf you know just like a yeah well you know you wear like a diamond necklace like a jicama pineapple you know and it was it was a novelty item so people were like curious it's pretty unique looking fruit everything can I try it no no no I don't need it and so eventually after it would reach maturity then they would just sell it but before they would sell it they would you know rent it out to be to be carried around and whatnot so by people who couldn't actually afford to buy it so people loved the look to it wasn't just a taste this is again bring it to a party you're having on this play people love the looks like charles ii he loved pineapples in general and he also referred to as the king pine because i know presumably because it's expensive and also because he thought it looked like it was wearing a crown or whatever so he was big on it and so you have but also so you have 16th century spanish historian Gonzalo furred and Fernandez de a video eval des he states of the pineapple look I do not suppose that there is in this whole world any other so exquisite and lovely appearances my pen and my words cannot depict such exceptional qualities nor appropriately blazing this fruit so as to particularize the case fully and satisfactorily without the brush or the sketch I mean pineapples look cool dude but I mean yeah but you know people if you've never seen a pineapple before and you're like whoa what is this thing you know but describe it to me in words yeah so you know they liked it artists architects liked it so yeah Adam today I don't know it's kind of spiky yeah yes yeah it's got some leaves sticking out the top that sort of thing yeah yeah so you have like have you ever seen the done more pineapple like the Scotland's famous was commissioned in 1761 by the Earl of Dunmore no way I looked up the the previous painting of the the pineapple the first pineapple I didn't look this up yeah they're done more pineapple if people want to look it's this basically Google right now I mean yeah google it you'll see it's just this structure this building it's good like you know we knew it might have like a curved top like oh wow yeah and it's just a pineapple humped up it's just got a giant pineapple sticking out the top yeah it's like that's like the ultimate flex like yeah my house pineapple right there but he's like yeah that's cheaper than an actual pineapple yeah yeah we you know built it with slaves but either way so next time you're ordering a pizza you think it's an interesting dichotomy here because you have this food item there was four four people and then you're putting on top of it little bits of things that not that long ago would have been only the exceptionally wealthy in much in parts of the world could have afford you just casually putting it on you know your poor food person item like yeah putting pineapple it's like you're I feel just next time you're out of the supermarket just appreciate ya did a couple hundred years ago someone was paying ten grand for the pineapple that you're buying for ya what two three bucks and let's just face it it's probably if you're buying like the pineapple like the whole Pinal it's probably just gonna sit on your shelf - rots and you're like I'll throw it away you know you know that's what happens is that I forgot to eat that pie not exactly back in the day no one forgets that you have a pineapple No exactly so yeah so in any event yeah that is the beads today I love it even despite our minor technical difficulties yeah I'm sure that maybe will be edited out of the audio version but we'll be present in the live version yeah we also broadcast this on YouTube here if you're watching on YouTube we also broadcast on podcasts if you're listening if you're watching on yuge I've got confused but you know the opposite of where you're seeing it now we do and I wonder it was there are several points in which I just kept talking when you tried to jump in like possibly so there could be some over talking in today's one um we'll see if you got upset with that listen to the audio version because it'll be tidied up a little people should just listen to that version anyway because it's better it is so Google it's neater go go brain food GI brain food fm yeah brain food one word where have you get your podcasts you will find ads and also yeah my computer won't have a stroke when I'm halfway through reading a quote which was awesome today uh anyway this has been the brain food show leave us a review if you fancy doing that we are giving away a thousand dollar Amazon gift voucher away yet to a thousand reviews so please do that well she's one lucky winner when that happens anything also need to add there I think we're good join us next time for another fascinating origins of food are we doing french fries next maybe yeah definitely a food item three snacks next time yeah totally you should yeah I'll just order a pizza you know actually have it well there won't be about pizza order some fries but delivery fries suck generally yeah they don't stay fresh enough all right well thank you very much there's been there's been the brain food show we will see you all or speak to you all or you will listen to us I suppose very soon
