and there are a few groups that have been marginalized over the past century more than trans people while we're starting to see more emergence of transgender musicians today there's actually a long history of transgender people making waves in popular music and if songs about transgender people helping to shape popular music let's take a closer look one of the earliest trans figures in popular music was Christine Jorgensen raised as a boy Jorgensen fought for the US Army in World War two after returning from service she transitioned in the early 1950s and became a nightclub performer and actress as a musician she released a few singles including crazy little planet dyin to superstardom Jorgenson made some headlines in her day and provided a groundwork for trans representation in popular music another one of the earliest visible trans figures in popular music was Jackie Shane Shane was an American soul singer who worked through the Canadian soul scene of the 1960s and even scored a charting hit with any other way in 1967 any of them a few years in the limelight she turned down an invitation to join Funkadelic and disappeared from the spotlight as Shane was working in the 60s the discussion started to shift around the nature of gender and sexuality thanks to the sexual revolution and voices and queer groups were getting louder in the midst of this world the who had their own take on gender on 1966's I'm a boy set in a future world where parents can choose the sex of their children that song tells of a family who order four girls but get a boy they decide to raise this child as a girl even though he keeps insisting he's a boy well it's not your typical take on a trans story many trans people will relate to the story of parents insisting a child is one gender while feeling deep inside they are something different this also shows how the concepts of sex and gender we're starting to enter public consciousness and soon many of the public's assumptions of sex and gender would be challenged thanks to the stars of Andy Warhol's Factory Andy Warhol helped bring a number of transgender actresses and artists into the public eye including candy darling and Hollywood lawn also when Warhol circles were The Velvet Underground who wrote songs about these Warhol superstars perhaps the most famous of these is Lou Reed's walk on the wild side but I've always found 1969's candy sales to be a particularly striking account of a transgender woman the opening lyrics of that song make it one of the first pieces of popular music to talk about gender dysphoria a condition that many trans people suffer from gender dysphoria is the dissonance that comes once emotional and psychological identity don't align with their assigned sex you can feel Lou Reed singing that dissonance from Candy's perspective too [Music] Lou Reed ran in the same circles as another musician who questioned and pushed the boundaries of gender David Bowie but we was on the forefront of the glam rock movement which sought to challenge expectations of gender sexuality and identity lady starr de sings of a cross-dressing singer while rebel rebel sings proudly of androgyny becoming an anthem of sorts for the movement two years after releasing rebel rebel David Bowie would enter into a relationship with a trans woman who would help shape the future of music Romi Hogg was a dutch performer who opened her own cabaret in 1974 in Berlin that venue became iconic in the mid 70s with names like Freddie Mercury mick jagger lou reed and of course david bowie frequenting it and so Romy Hogg helped make Berlin a musical epicenter in the 70s and she's part of the reason David Bowie spent some of his most productive years in Berlin around this time Europe saw more trans visibility in their pop stars marie-france was a transgender film star in the 1970s and 80s in France and she also had a music career that included the 1977 single Daisy [Music] they see over the next few decades a number of songs would pop up questioning the nature of gender in 1983 the Waterboys wrote a girl called Johnny and while they Rose it in tribute to Patti Smith its lyrics can be read as a clear trance Tori in 1984 The Replacements wrote androgynous a song about androgyny and gender identity that song clearly tapped into something as a number of other artists have covered it since in 1991 the crash test dummies covered it and released it as a single the video for their version of that song even featured a number of people challenging gender norms in it and then in the early 2000s rock legend Joan Jett gave her own take on androgynous Joan Jett would go on to cover that song again this time alongside one of modern music's great trans icons Laura Jane grace born Thomas James Gable Grace is the lead singer of against meetin throughout her career grace had a painful public struggle with her gender identity in against meas the Ocean she even sings that she would have been born a woman if she had a choice then in 2012 Grace's publicly came out as a transgender woman and began her transition she documented this experience in against me sixth studio album trans gender dysphoria blues that was a monumental album when it came to trans history it was a full piece written by a trans artist about her experiences on a public stage and this is a trend that's coming more into the forefront in the modern day trans people have more of a voice than ever and this is reflected in the music scene across all of music we have artists challenging traditional notions of gender and identity in their music Lucas Silveira became the first trans man to sign with a major record label in 2006 and has continued to make music since then there's che Dimond a trance singer who wrote her own personal anthem I am [Music] and there's transgender people across all musical genres from the folk of Schuyler Cargill to unknown ease art pop even opera has its own trans icon now with Breanna Sinclair a who became the first transgender woman to sing the national anthem at a pro sporting event in 2015 transgender people have made countless contributions to music history they've been the subject of and creators of songs that have shaped the current musical world and as more trans musicians emerge they'll help push music into a brighter future by bringing their own stories
