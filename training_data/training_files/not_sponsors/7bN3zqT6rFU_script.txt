you by Squarespace what's up being Lea in deep molars we're here today with Todd Bain ezel just coming off shooting a movie camera we met those recently came out but it is now not in theaters depending on when you're watching this podcast we're gonna break some scenes down we're gonna talk about lighting color you guys guys first off lassard's what's going on indie Mugler's today I'm here with Todd Ben hazel whose amazing depreciating things like music videos from Orange and I'm on may faint as commercial career as well and finally shooting the movie hustlers which has just come out in recent past weekend it's still in theaters right now set for each of these we were basically gonna break down each clip in terms of the actual script camera lenses finally were in talk about a little Todd secret sauce that you might sprinkled in there some challenges from said or a couple things that you were working with cool Todd tell me a little bit about the production and the experience of shooting hustlers it was really hard and really inspired and I think we all knew that we had lightning in a bottle I would call it like a like a little big movie you know it was like a little studio film shoot with omens so we shown the Panavision DXL to using detune Panna speed lenses so places like Panavision an area can basically open up the lenses and change some of the physical characteristics so that things can happen where the lenses are softer they flare easier or the blacks or softer or the highlights glow or maybe they can do crazy stuff now mm-hmm so we detain them to get them to look kind of the way you intentionally add a little character making that so clean exactly we wind to shoot large-format because we wanted this movie look bit larger than life we wanted like the women to look like kind of like superheroes yeah but we also didn't want to look like the sharpest cleanest image so we tried to find a balance between like really big and bold and poppy but also like human and imperfect and that came in the lenses a little bit so in the scene destiny play by Constance Wu has just seen Ramona played by Jennifer Lopez downstairs giving her killer striptease it's basically the scene where our main character falls in love with the other character and and blocks in what she wants from us the movie and then she goes upstairs and finds her on the roof and asked her for a cigarette when Stevie Wonder came in well the Stevie Wonder come the god Kaycee item in the champagne room so where's the guardian blah Wow how come you're so good that's a really good luck and scene all right so Jennifer Lopez over here and then we've got a constant slew over here and then we have her giant coat yes if she's wrapped her up in nice we knew we wanted to be on a rooftop there was like a door that leads out from here so we knew that the constants would start here and we would notice Jen here smoking alone to an ass for a cigarette should go join her so the main thing we knew is that like the the wide who's gonna be from here thirty five thirty fun on the wood whatever punching this uh they were probably eighty Mills yep so these are eighty millimeters were probably used about two of them for those yeah we shot this to cam really so you had two cameras running at the same time yeah the wide was probably one and then once we got in there we did cross coverage across coverage it's a night skyline this rooftop did not have anything for them to sit on or had like a very low we needed something that had multiple levels so that they could sit the way they are sitting Jane muskie was our product designer we asked them to build a ledge that looks like it's coming from the building inside but actually stops right there it's flat so they are actually mount on the edge of the roof no they're sitting on this ledge that we built there in the middle and you guys built a ledge here yeah that had a glass looking like it you know like rooftops have these things yeah chose the plexi that would go inside of it and then we put inside of it LED lights so it looks like it's coming from the building inside but actually that stops right there it's flat like the scene needs a white point right it needs something white so that the rest can go like super colorful and dark so that the I can like rest in that so it just gives like a base right if you're gonna do everything else it's super colorful and dark you need one thing for the eye to hold on to it's a way to make it dark without it feeling murky yeah because all of a sudden now you're saying oh that's what regular little things should look like so you know okay they're just not in the light so the main light here is just one light which is a giant backlight two or three blocks away on a condor there's one light in here which is I think it was a 24k tungsten light with like some orange gel that we picked she's so intoxicated by Jen so they get this big gorgeous halo off to the left there's this like air conditioning unit okay we hid a fogger back there yep then pushes fog which catches the warm backlight so then in the back there is this like steam and haze behind them the only other thing on here was one mover light called a solo frame and that solo frame we use to paint the background it's a theatrical light and wherever the background like those buildings were getting too dull and flat we put a bunch of color contrasted blue so that they our kind of warmer pink orange characters yeah stay off it makes it almost seemed like moonlight is hitting those buildings yes further romance right so there is a fill light going on in their face so there's balance here and that bounce bounces back the gold back light and that's what you see in their skin and then over somewhere over here I think we bounce an LED light that was pink so this is probably like a digital Sputnik bouncing into this and it's doing their faces that's what's giving them that exact room almost so that's what gives them the pink in their skin in the highlights in their jewelry yeah and it also puts the highlight in that AC unit in the background set up a light and then let it get a little messy let it reflect on things let it like that's the reason we used a bigger source and bounced it is not because we want it to be prettier but because we wanted to be a bigger source that would reflect in all the things on the roof this seems so hyper-stylized I want to do anything you could do to ground it makes it feel like there's probably a neon sign over here with lighting where it is pretty like hyper stylized you've got to do something to give it as a mess so this is where they're starting to drug the guys and basically they pick them up at the bar they drugged them and then they take them to the club where they run up their credit cards hey these are my sisters visually they start like fishing for so many different guys so we built this scenario where like we're doing all these repetitive camera moves in this one corner of the bar it's a real bar in New York City kind of goes like this and then there's a bunch of tables and extras added uh and then this is like the bar we chose this corner because we wanted a scenario where each guy could sit in the corner and he could be surrounded over by all our characters and every time it starts he's like hey these are my sisters and then the camera wit pans over and dollies in on our other characters entering in most of the coverage I believe we laid dancefloor down on the ground black a dance floor hmm so that the dolly could constantly be shifting or what is vengeful so basically instead of laying track yeah which is perfect but then you're only York restricted to one move no if you put down black dance floor on top of it basically the entire floor becomes dolly liveable we laid the dance floor and then we just say cool next scene dolly pushes in next scenes dolly wraps around next scene we would always finish a scene and then whip off we would start here and whip on and then you hide the cut in that blurry gotcha that's real open with the lens and so what are you working with oh we did most asana zoom lens um because a lot of these moves are not only dolly moves but they're dolly zooms here we used it as kind of a throwback to like our favorite crime movies like the Scorsese dolly zoom we're like the cameras just like crashing it it's basically yes doing forward while you push exactly whereas if you did it the opposite way to get that vertigo effect yeah and like you just actually do them together PT Anderson does this a lot too I think it was a 24 to 75 Oh t28 that is but that's like the joy it is you can go from like really big to like that Wow you know things are just happened yeah it's so natural and fast yeah easy yeah and that's the point of the scene the point of the scene is that it's happening it's easy and it's fun yeah cool so moving on was talking about lighting what are we doing in terms of the light so the basic idea here is we wanted the whole bar to be lit because we knew we're gonna have to shoot everywhere and we had no time so it was a lot about communicating with art the art department every one of those little practical lamps that we asked art to basically put them like we said you can't put too many of these debar like he needs to feel like this is the style of this bar is that they put lots of little practical lamps on every single table you just want as many point sources and glowing things as possible and then the main thing that's going on is hidden above the bar there is a long LED strip that's shooting up into the ceiling so off on the right where those people are sitting above them it's hidden because there's like a lip but inside that lip is something shooting down and it bounces off the bar and then you have on the actual bar lights themselves which are just at that location that we dimmed down the ones that are on those picture frames aren't brought those in those are little things just clip and they look like they're like fancy little photo in a painting light we want a whole bar to feel a warm soft glow that's coming from a billion different little sources not from like our of movie lights and - it just means that everywhere you point there's little point sources and they reflect and it gives it like a reality and then we ask for a white tablecloth so that it bounces up you just want to all these things that give the whole place this light glowing uniform yeah gives this kind of atmospheric softly exactly unopposed so then we hazed up the place it takes all these little lights and just brings it up a little bit usually I ask for the heiser to be put in the background so the first thing you do when you get there is like you talk to the effects person you say like the main setup is looking this way so put the haze or somewhere way back there because if the hazers in your camera yours blasting smoke into the foreground and you're literally just gonna throw your front lights just gonna hit it and it's just gonna become dust actually it's better to kind of think okay I don't know what if there was been haze and fog haze is thinner then fog haze will give texture in the air and is generally like lighter fog and smoke look like fog and smoke and are much heavier and also they help stay in the air as easily for the rooftop scene it was fog so his logos billowing in the background and for this scene it was haze who would stay in the room then the main thing that's going on here is that above our main area right to the ceiling off of two-by-fours is light tile probably something like this yeah rigged above it is like one or two of them these are just being that kind of shooting down lightly right down and that's to give them that kind of soft Oh red exactly essentially what it's like is you're making like a big 3d soft light by doing this kind of matrix of little ice everywhere and then you're cheating with this one and then the diffusion for this is the Higgs and it makes this kind of you're inside of this giant soft light yeah and then on top of them you shape it a little bit more by adding a topper above there exactly is awesome this is all art like art had to kill it on this day they had to bring the right lights with the way to communicate at the right kind of like covers that the bar didn't have any of this naturally none of it I mean it had the hanging lights you know hold on dear to your heart and now back to the episode the scene where Ramona played by Jennifer Lopez begins to teach destiny had a strip front hook hold on with I'm here you can do carousel but you head back is it Table Talk I can't do that you can do that you're gonna do that and get to see the club for the first time during the day which means all the lights are on and it's demystified it's not the club that's meant for men it's the club that's meant for the people that work there the women alright this is fun because we actually get to draw the club the stage kind of goes like this and then there's steps down on either side just like a main pole here and there's the entrance to the club is here there's a bar here seats all over the place beauty of this and this is the genius of Loreen yeah is that the blocking is such that Constance is like sitting like a kid looking up at her hero in the blocking does that all the storytelling you need talk to me a little bit camera we're replacing this okay why do we play so the thought here is to shoot the whole scene handheld to camera the cameras probably started in a wide to see what was going on then we had another one doing like a long lens through her body to Constance then we have looking up at how incredible Jen is from tighter then we have stuff where were actually standing with Jen at the pole lens probably somewhere in the 50 mils own you know probably thirty fives fifties eighties stuff that you can like be with them and all handhelds so that it's just it's just with them it's physical it's fun it's loose two cameras have yourself what are our first two cameras number shooting with one second to everyone like starting wide for obvious reasons of like you start wider or the lighting you've said it and then everyone gets to know the scene actors start to warm up and then as you move in you start tweaking and getting closer he probably started shooting more on Jen because she was doing all this for real we wanted also constants reactions to it in real times this and this we want to make sure like a stunt that when she had nailed it we had covered it this is interesting to me because just from the way that you lit it I can tell even though it's indoors even though I really have no sight of sunlight or anything in this I can tell this is the club during the day and you have to the club tonight totally there's a few things doing that so the main thing is going on here is this is all the built-in club lighting right which is basically there's a scaffolding rig up here le you can actually see one in the shot they're like these LED square lights that just like put a ton of light right now what does scaffolding for people that throw those scaffolding is like these metal beams that can hold a lot of weight though we had a couple mover lights up here which we like those theatrical mover lights cross beams are there to outline her muscles only make sure that this doesn't look like how the men see it this is athlete loading actually I mean yeah a lot of sports commercials do this guy that's the big difference is like when in the scene where she's dancing at night is she's a top lit and under lit it's like this alien it's like sexy and her body super smooth totally she's this idealized version but in this scene you realize it's just hard work and she's an athlete now the stage itself the floor you see that ring of light now the actual club did this but we asked art to build this into a circle and extend it and then make the entire thing here plexi white and milk plexi we tested a bunch of Lexi's and found the one that was the right quality on skin inside this ring underneath are LED lights pointing up into the plexi weight this was not a part of a location you guys built this part of the state we extended the stage so then also what we did is above the center pole you know we built a softbox which I'm not sure if you can see it in this scene but there's a softbox above the pole you also all around the club where do all the ceilings yeah our movers there are flood light LEDs this is the kind of the ideas like you read all this and then you can do whatever you want so with all of this we're able to then make it look like day or night so the day scene what you're looking at is all of these lights turned on be like a hundred percent space is now lit and then the other main thing is that you can see there is that there's a wall of LED lights you know that came with the club when we're at night in club mode we had them on we got lucky and the only other thing that we're missing here is really that there was an open front door and we I think we put a giant probably 12 by of white diffusion so that when you look out it's blown out you know and we shot in 18k hm I threw it back here they're like just club lighting your lamps or steps or LED things it's all just like no points are seized now I like this cuz that makes a nice little line we all matter - exactly there's also like there's a shiny curtain on the far left like that's not actually a light that's just a Kurd and reflecting light it's like often we just ask for like mirrors or like shiny surfaces for the background cuz you're literally doubling all of your lights in the space I would say this special sauce is that there's a quarter blue on this HMI which Mikey Groot made fun of me for and said that why would you add more blue to an HMI there's already pretty blue when you're in a room that's so warm yeah you would normally think it's night but if there's some aspect you feel a doorway there that is cooler than daylight yeah we had to go extra daylight is the reason just regular white wasn't enough why it would have looked like night because your eyes have adjusted to the Tennessee this is awesome rod thank you so much for doing out of the show of course how's it still in theaters right now if you haven't seen it already absolutely fantastic seriously it looks some freaking good Todd if they have any questions can they find you online
