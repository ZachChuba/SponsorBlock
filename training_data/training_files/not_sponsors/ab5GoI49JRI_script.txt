hey guys my name is tomato anus and this is a Fallout New Vegas all sleeping partners speedrun the goal this category is exactly what it sounds like you start a brand new game and sleep with every possible partner that's available in the base game of Fallout New Vegas similar to 80% glitches are allowed to be used in the speedrun but console commands are not one thing we do to make this speedrun much easier isn't sure that our deliverables are much more presentable and that's why this video is brought to shipping in addition to making sure that we're properly groomed this speedrun is performed on the most recent version of Fallout New Vegas we don't down patch our game or anything and we also perform the speedrun without any mods installed in addition to this we play on the very easy difficulty so that we take less damage and deal more damage allowing for us to kill enemies more quickly and we also limit our framerate to 60fps as you can see in the top right corner of my screen I should also mention that if you want to watch this speedrun with just the game audio or with the original audio doing this run live on Twitch there are links in the description below we kept our framerate to 60 because Fallout New Vegas has very inconsistent walking speeds if you leave your framerate uncapped and we just want to make sure that anyone doing speedruns is competing on an even playing field one of the first things you may have noticed already is that the game is actually being played in Italian Italian is the fastest language for Fallout New Vegas speedruns because doc mitchell's dialogue is four seconds faster than it is in English that's the fastest language overall doc mitchell's dialogue is the only one we care about when it comes to language differences because it's the only dialogue we can't skip in the speed run this run is being performed with the mercenary Pack DLC installed which is part of the courier stash add-on the only reason for this is that we want to spawn with the mercenary grenade rifle because we use it for a glitch right away in the run and we also use it for combat later on getting into the actual run we start our game as male and we dump all of our special stats into strengths because they don't actually matter right now and we want to get through assigning our special stats as fast as possible this whole doc Mitchell segment just consists of mashing through all of his dialogue using both the enter button and our mouse button and also looting some doctor's bag and stimpacks to sell later on similar to our special stats what skills and perks we tagged don't matter right now so we just mash a to accept as soon as they pop up you've probably noticed by now that my screen keeps flashing to the loading screen that's because I'm quick saving and quick loading quick saving and quick loading in both fallout 3 and new Vegas is very abusable by allowing you to skip dialogs that you normally have to sit there and listen to and also allowing for you to clip through walls in addition to that quick saving and quick loading resets your momentum so if you're falling from a very great height and quick save and quick load right before you hit the ground you won't take fall damage whenever you see the loading screen flash up throughout the run it's most likely because I'm quick saving and quick loading to do any of the things that I just mentioned also the reason why I couldn't just quick save in quick load through doc mitchell's intro dialogue is that we don't have control over our character until he finishes that so we can't quick save and quick load just yet I just did a couple really involved glitches in rapid succession but don't worry I'll explain them both in depth in a second all you need to know is after leaving doc mitchell's we went over to the schoolhouse and grabbed a bunch of mantis eggs upon exiting the schoolhouse we fast traveled to good Springs and entered the general store to shop with Chet from Chet we buy at least one round of a special ammo type for a 357 revolver and then sell a bunch of random items that we have in order to get a lot of caps we also wanted to buy a 357 revolver from Chet but he didn't have it in his shop so we had to take it forcibly once we completely loot Chet's body and exit the store we do a couple reload ashes to the left and then start doing a glitch that we call time stop now we've done a lot since the time we've left Doc Mitchell's house so let me go back and explain everything in chronological order all you need to know is that right now in the background I'm running towards west side and along the way discovering sloane samson rock crushing plant and the thorn so right when we left doc mitchell's house we did a glitch called speed if you're familiar with fallout 3 speed runs you'll know what this is already in fallout 3 and new Vegas you have a base speed of 100 units in these games that when you one of your legs you get an animation showing that your leg is crippled and it also reduces your base movement speed by 60 naturally when you heal your leg the game gives you your 60 moves to be back to bring you back up to 100 and it also removes the  animation if you make a quick save and then your leg and quick load at the same exact time that your leg becomes crippled the game will give you this 60 move speed back after you quick load so that means that the games memory values are getting messed up and the 60 move speed is being added on top of your base 100 move speed that you have after you quick load after you perform this glitch you'll maintain 160 units of speed until you either your legs quit to the main menu or desktop or rebuild your character if you're familiar with Fallout New Vegas speed runs you may be wondering why we do speed here instead of reload dashing but we'll get to that in a second now one of the partners that we need to sleep with in the speed is Red Lucy of the thorn in order to sleep with red Lucy we have to complete the quest bleed me dry which consists of traveling around the Mojave and collecting eggs from a bunch of different creatures the very first creature we have to collect eggs from our mantises luckily there are a bunch of mantises that spawn in the school house right next to docs and with them there are a couple egg sacs typically you're supposed to go and collect each egg after she tells you to go get it but you can give her eggs that you already have if you have at least 12 of that type unfortunately when these eggs spawn they only spawn in groups of about two or three but luckily there is a glitch that allows for us to dupe items that we find in containers in order to duplicate an item it has to spawn in the container you can't put it in there yourself what you do then is place a large amount of one item from your inventory into the container with just the eggs we then click to take back the stack of items we put in the container and also press a to take all items right after if we time it correctly then we will have the option to pick up as many eggs from the container as the item we put in in this speedrun we use ammo to duplicate the eggs because we have a lot of it from the start however one caveat to the glitch is that the item that you deposit into the container must have weight this means that in order to do this glitch with ammo we have to plan hardcore naturally it's faster to put the game into hardcore mode at the beginning when we get a pop up at Docs rather than have to pull up the menu later on that's why this entire speedrun is done in hardcore mode we don't need to turn it off after we do all the duping we need throughout the run because we finished the run well before we receive any negative effects from hardcore mode we do this glitch two other times throughout the run to duplicate other items but we'll get there in a bit after we dupe the eggs we went to chats and took his 357 revolver and got a bunch of caps and then we did a couple reload dashes which is a glitch I'll explain in a bit right now I want to explain this whole place marker thing you've been seeing over the past couple minutes now in Fallout New Vegas there are a total of twelve people or things that you can sleep with unfortunately a couple of these characters will only sleep with you if you're male and couple only sleep with fear of your female as you may be aware there's no way to change your sex in Fallout New Vegas after you've left Goodsprings there are only two times in the game that you can change your sex the first is when you're initially creating your character in doc Mitchell's house and the second is after you leave Goodsprings and you get a pop-up asking you if you want to rebuild your character ideally we want to rebuild our character after we sleep with the first couple people who will only sleep with us if we're a male if we were able to do this we could sleep with the people who are exclusive to males and then change our sex to female and sleep with the rest of the NPC's now this raises the question of how exactly are we going to rebuild our character if we need to travel well outside of good Springs to sleep with the first couple and PCs the answer to this is the time stop glitch if you press f3 to pull up the map in your pip-boy and mash right-click while it's being pulled up then the game will ask you to set a marker but it'll lower your pip-boy in doing so this allows you to continue to walk while still having the marker prompt up on your screen the game still believes that you're in your pip-boy though so that means that the game world is still frozen all around you this explains the frozen deathclaw NPCs that I've been walking by this whole time now while doing this glitch though because the world is frozen that means the world is also not loading because of that I have to continually exit out of this glitch so that the world around me will load and sometimes that'll cause for the rebuild character screen to pop up when that happens I exit out of it in quick load since I'm making quick saves every time I do the time stop glitch luckily the rebuilt character screen only will pop out when you're in the mojave wasteland and it won't pop up when you're inside of other areas that means that whenever we're inside or inside places like West Side we don't need to do the time stop glitch arriving on west side we go straight to the Casas madrid apartments because that's where sweetie Jimmy and Maud are located immediately upon entering the apartments we head upstairs where we paid Jimmy 200 caps and Maz 75 caps in rapid succession which means we all sleep together and have one of the strangest threesomes in human history if you're unaware these two characters will exclusively sleep with men because Jimmy is homosexual and Maude is really picky after fulfilling our wildest fantasy we walk down the hallway and paste sweetie 300 caps to sleep with us after having to load up our body with sildenafil we fast travel back to the thorn we quickly enter before the rebuilt character screen pops up and then make our way over to read Lucy and get the quest bleed me dry after we accept the quest from Lucy we have to stand there with our hands in our pockets until our one dozen mantis eggs that we picked up earlier converts into a pile of giant mantis eggs after that we can talk to her again and turn in that stage of the quest after which she then tasks us with finding some red scorpion eggs after we're done flirting with Lucy we exit the thorn and wait for the rebuild character screen to pop up at which point we change our sex to female assign our special stats and pick our perks and skills for our special stats we lower our strength to one in perception to four just to have enough points to max out both endurance and charisma we need to max out endurance to increase our survival so that we can then take travel light later on and we max out our charisma so we can have more speech for skills we untag the default melee weapons and tag science and then choose good-natured for our perk the reason we tag science is to get it to start at 30 so that we can romance a character later on and we picked good nature to increase our speech and science even further after we've got all that handled we begin to do a glitch called reload dashing you saw me do this earlier by reload dashing sideways a couple times right after we left chats general storing good Springs I'll explain how reload dashing works in a bit but for now all you need to know is that we dash into an unintended play area and discover the fast triple point for it free side after that we faster all back to good Springs and start making our way towards the deathclaw quarry outside of which is where the radscorpion eggs are located that we need to get to romance red Lucy after we actually get the eggs we want to launch ourselves up in the air and dash over to some great khans who are on the outskirts of the Dethklok quarry we talked with them briefly and let them know we'll find their package that never arrived from there we fast travel to Sloan look inside a suitcase inside and speak with chomps Luis who lets us know that we need to find Tyrone we'll then fast travel down to good Springs and begin reload dashing down to prim which is where Tyrone is located along the way will level up survival to 45 and speech to 50 we want speech at 50 because that's required to pass a speech check later on we want survival at 45 so we can take travel light later on when we level up we'll be taking Black Widow as our perk so that we can sleep with Tyrone when we arrive in his tent now that I'm a bit ahead on commentary I'll briefly explain reload dashing reload dashing is for sure the most efficient way to traverse the wasteland in Fallout New Vegas unfortunately we're not able to do it while doing time stop because we need to be entering our pit boi non-stop and there's no way to do time stop and reload - easily so we wouldn't be able to delay the character rebuild menu as I mentioned earlier the character rebuild menu removes feed  which is actually good for us because you can't reload - and have speed crippled at the same time unless you reload - to the side which is really inefficient in the long haul reload dashing works by continually holding W while swapping ammo with a gun that has a one bullet at a time reload animation this animation is bugged in a way that kind of launches you forward just by a little bit when you finish the animation if you cancel the animation and unequipped the gun after doing so all while still holding w when you lower the pip-boy you get slingshotted forward by a sizable amount there are a couple other nuances with reload dashing that I need to explain but I'm beginning to fall behind on the route again so let's jump back to that and put a pin in reload dashing upon sleeping with a surprisingly white Tyrone we leave his tent and fast travel back to the thorn here we speak with red Lucy and try and flirt with her some more only to learn that the red scorpion eggs aren't enough and now she wants fire deco eggs after seemingly coming to an agreement that fire gecko eggs are a fair trade for fish tacos we leave the thorn and fast travel to free side when we arrive in freeside we'll quickly head over to Mick and Ralph's where we'll speak with Ralph's real quick and buy a counterfeit passport after we buy the passport we're going to head upstairs and do that item duping glitch again but the and we're going to do it on vault three jumpsuits we're going to need 30 jumpsuits and because we don't have 30 of one type of ammo we're going to have to do the duping glitch with two different dressers that both spawn with of all three jumpsuits the reason why we need these jumpsuits is that later avoid a romance Sarah Weintraub we need to give her at least 30 jumpsuits in order to sleep with her now that I'm ahead again let's go back to real Oh dashing really quickly the main thing about real Oh dashing is that you have to be in a walking animation to perform it this means that typically you can only reload - while you're on solid ground this kind of sucks for speedrunners because when you reload - you tend to move at very high velocities which means if you bump into a slightly ramped object you get shot up into the air we can actually use this to our advantage though as you see me do a couple times throughout this run when you get launched into the air if you stop holding any directional inputs then you'll eventually hit a ceiling and stop flying up but you actually won't fall down either after you've hit this ceiling in fact you'll be floating in mid-air on what seems to be a platform even though there's actually nothing there when you're floating like this the game actually thinks you're on the ground so you're free to wait or fast travel or even reload - if you time it correctly back to the actual run after leaving Mick and Ralph's we proceeded to reload - over to the Northside gate area here we went over to the atomic wrangler because we want to speak with James Garrett inside and let him know that we'll look for some proclivities for him after speaking with James we then reload - over to the actual North gate and use our fake passport to get in once inside the strip we're quickly going to reload - through the first two areas and enter the vault 21 gift shop here will speak with Sara Weintraub and hand over all those vault suits that we borrowed from Mick and Ralph after that we'll head downstairs and spend the night in a twin bed with our favorite thottie while this whole thing goes on there is one other piece of movement tech that I haven't really gotten the chance to explain yet which is called stop hopping this is a glitch that you may have seen me perform in previous runs and you'll see me do a couple times throughout this run stop hopping looks a lot like bunny hopping but I can you it's very different stop hopping is performed by holding W jumping and then flicking your camera to the side and back forward to build up momentum and then right before you land you let go of w jump again and begin holding W again flick your camera again let go jump and just repeat that process over and over if you time it correctly you can chain multiple stop hops together and travel at about the same speed as speed before you ask stop hopping doesn't stack with speed so that's why I wasn't doing it earlier stop hopping is a great tool though to use throughout the run in areas where reload - just doesn't make sense or you don't have your weapon on you after sleeping with Sara bear we're going to clip out of bounds and fall into the void when you do this and fall out games and you fall far enough you respawn at what's called a center on cell location COC for short this is a predetermined location that is set for every interior cell in the game it's just in place so that if you somehow fall out of bounds while playing casually you don't fall for all eternity and you were at least relocated to somewhere in the area typically COC locations are right near the entrance of the area which is perfect for right now since we can clip out of bounds twice in rapid succession and exit out to the strip pretty quickly after leaving vault 21 we run into our old pal Victor before we head over into the next area of the strip and enter the tops once we're in the tops we hand over our weapons and then walk forward far enough to hit a trigger that gives us a bunch of XP we then quicksaving quick load which will allow for us to level up after we speak to Swank and convince him that we should probably try and get Benny arrested after talking to Swank we level up our science to exactly 60 and take the travel light perk which increases our move speed by 10% when we wear light or no armor we then speak with Benny and use black widow dialogue choices to remind him that were a courier and know how to handle a package we were given back our weapons after we talked to a swank a moment ago so we're able to then reload - back to the elevator which we take up to Benny's floor once we load in on his floor we're gonna walk backwards and left and clip out-of-bounds which will COCs exact in the middle of Benny's room we then wait one hour to skip Benny's walk up to the room and also the time that he does his final manscaping preparations for the night we then talk with Benny and decide it's best to strip-search him after finding a suspicious bulge on his body when we're finished with Matthew Perry we exit his room and reload - sound of the elevator once back in the lobby we enter the courtyard of the tops which is actually in the same interior cell as the courtyard of the Gomorrah if we clip out of bounds in the tops courtyard we can reload - in this out-of-bounds area over to the courtyard of the Gomorrah where there are two females who we can converse with and exchange caps for lustful acts once we clip into the courtyard area we speak with Joana with whom we agreed to exchange currency for sleepy time Joana begins to walk to her bachelorette pad which gives us time to go over and talk with dazzle when we speak with dazzle we use the black widow perk to haggle her down to fifty caps for a quickie during the fade to black were able to reload - towards Joanna's room and actually get launched up into the air a little bit so we're able to just drop down into the hallway right outside of her door similar to with Benny we have to wait one hour for Joana to finish her walk up to the room and also brush her cat before we slam clams once in her room we speak with Joanna and proceed to lay on her bed and then watch her change from a very revealing outfit into a less revealing outfit before the screen fades to black [Music] after enjoying the moment we leave Joanna's room and proceed to exit the Camorra by reload dashing through the backroom and the lobby once near the front we tell the bouncer to mind his own business and were unjustifiably kicked out of the gomorrah once outside we fast travel back to free side and choose to stop getting sidetracked from finding proclivities for james garrett when we actually enter free side we walk to the right a little bit to get the perfect angle to reload - into this decrepit building on the left and if you hit it at just the right spot you kind of bounce around on the walls on the inside just right so that you appear out on the other end right by Santiago we speak with Santiago and tell him to head over to the atomic wrangler and begin making our way to the old mormon fort now in place of Santiago we could actually send old Ben to the atomic wrangler instead the problem with this is that we can't sleep with old Ben at the atomic wrangler whereas we can sleep with santiago that means that in order to sleep with all possible people in the run we have to send santiago to the wrangler instead at the fort we speak with Beatrix and let her know that James Guerra is looking to hire an escort with her type of capabilities after sending via tricks on her Mary away we exit the fort and begin reload dashing towards cerulean robotics coming up is a sleeping partner who is the reason why we needed to get our science up to sixty once we actually enter cerulean robotics we're going to equip our grenade launcher and we're gonna be making quick saves pretty often because there's a lot of rats inside here and they get pretty obnoxious in one of the first rooms we need to pick up a key on the ground that's under a body that's also surrounded by rats we can't just fire our tornade launcher into the room no to clear off the rats because that'll send the key flying and we won't be able to find us after we get the key we enter the next room and run around the desks in order to kind of lure the rats into a good position and then just blast them away we use the key to open a tool cabinet to grab the terminal access card which will allow for us to access the computer where we pass our science check and activate the dubiously named Fisto after we activate Fisto we wait one hour to skip his walking animation and also to give him enough time to polish its knobs we then have a brief dialogue with Fisto and decide to give him a spin after spending our night with a toaster we exit cerulean robotics and fast traveled back to the north gate here we proceed to reload - back north towards the atomic wrangler where we have a couple friends waiting for us after entering the wrangler will speak with francine real quick and purchase the room for just 10 caps we then have to wait until after 1:00 p.m. for James to start his shift behind the counter once James arrives for work we let him know that we found a smooth talker for him who is Santiago and a goal for him who is Beatrix after this brief discussion we can then head over to Santiago who has some new fresh digs and hire him for the night wasting no time after talking with Santiago we head over to Beatrix who's taken a seat at the counter by James she too will be joining us in our room for the night we decide to give Santiago and Beatrix a courtesy hour to get to know each other better before we head up to the room ourselves by the time we finally make it up to the room Santiago and Beatrix are both passed out luckily all we have to do is interact with them in order to wake them up and have a little fun ourselves after listening to what I heard coming from my parents from growing up we figure it's time to finally get some more creature eggs for Red Lucy upon exiting the Wrangler we fast travel down to prim and start reload dashing towards a cave but it's not a cave for fire gecko eggs it turns out that there's actually a cave between prim and the fire gecko cave that houses eggs for night stalkers if you aren't familiar with the bleed me dry quest that we do for Red Lucy after we get fire gecko eggs we then have to go and collect some nightstalker eggs for her similar to the giant mantis eggs though we're going to need to have at least a dozen of them to convert it into an egg pile to give the Red Lucy because we're not going to be going out and getting the Night Stalker eggs when we actually have the active quest to go and collect them this means that when we go and get the Nightstalker eggs we have to do the item duping glitch one last time the cave where we go and get the Nightstalker eggs from the speedrun is walking box cavern luckily the interior of this cave isn't too complex or too windy so it usually just takes one reload - to get near the end of the cave where the eggs are located the one thing that we have to be careful of in both the nightstalker cave and throughout the rest of the speedrun when collecting these creature eggs is to make sure that we don't get our Lakes crippled at all we don't really have any stimpacks left so if our lake has got crippled we wouldn't be able to heal them at all which is a huge issue the reason why this is problematic to the speedrun is as I mentioned earlier if you have a speed you can't really reload - - well but that's not just at rate of speed crippled that's a trait of having a crippled leg so if one of our legs gets broken by one of these creatures then we won't be able to reload - for the rest of the run this adds a lot of tension to the end of the run as you can see reflected by my heart rate at the bottom of the screen I neglected to mention earlier that that heart with the number next to it is my heart rate live during the speedrun and it was actually kind of elevated a lot during this run typically when I'm doing runs twitch my heartrate rest between 65 to 75 beats per minute for some reason though this run just felt really good from the get-go now it's kind of on edge during the full thing and not wanting to mess it up I think an added factor to this was the fact that it was the second attempt of the day and the idea of getting a solid run like this one that early on in a stream really elevates the situation but I digress after leaving walking Vox cavern we reload dashed over to bootjack cavern which is where the fire gecko eggs are located this cave is a bit more windy and complex than walking box cavern so we can't just reach the eggs at the end with one reload - we make it back to the entrance of the cave very easily though by clipping out-of-bounds and CEO seeing to the entrance once out of the cavern we want to create as much distance between us and the geckos as possible so that we can safely fast travel back to the thorn one easy solution to this is the launch ourselves in the air and then stop pressing any directional buttons as I mentioned earlier and then fast travel once we land on that floating platform that appears when you hit the ceiling unfortunately the thorn has strict labor practices and does not open it until 6:00 a.m. you can bet your bottom though that will be the very first in line once they open their doors for business in the morning once inside we go up and talk to red Lucy and give her the fire gecko eggs and then we have to wait again just like we did earlier with the Mantis eggs for the nightstalker eggs to convert themselves into a giant pile upon talking with red Lucy we learned that giant mantis eggs radscorpion eggs fire gecko eggs and Night Stalker eggs just aren't enough and we need to provide her with some cazador eggs as well luckily we know just where to find them upon exiting the thorn we immediately fast travel to the samson rock crushing plant upon arrival we're going to start reload dashing to the Northwest towards Red Rock Canyon there's actually a pathway in the back of Red Rock Canyon that connects it to Jamestown that you aren't actually supposed to be able to access from Red Rock Canyon because the slope is so steep this pathway connecting Red Rock Canyon to Jamestown is actually where the cazador eggs are located luckily we can use reload dashing in the fact that we can get launched up in the air and - to our advantage here once we reach the back of Red Rock Canyon our goal is to reload - ourselves off of a rock or a tent or some sort of slope in order to shoot ourselves up high enough that allows for us to reload - over the steep slope that blocks us from the pathway to the cazador eggs after making it up the slope we have to be careful not to launch ourselves too high because we might pass an invisible wall that will lock us behind it and keep us stuck in rocks pretty much ending the run this is why my heart rate is so high during the segment because one the launch up to skip that steep slope is pretty difficult and two is a couple days before this run I lost another incredibly paced speed run to this section because I got launched up too high and got stuck in some rocks behind an invisible wall and got softlocked and couldn't finish the run when walking up to the eggs and grabbing them you have to be very careful not to get stung by any of the Casa doors which is why I'm using time stops so much here if you get stung by them you're going to be under the effects of their venom for a good long while and you actually can't fast travel away when you're under the effects of their venom the tactic here for fast traveling away from the Cazadores though is the same as with the geckos try and launch yourself up in the air to create more distance between you and them and then fast travel away twitch we're actually able to do very smoothly in this run once we arrive back at the thorn Red Lucy lets us know that there's just one more creature egg we need to provide in order to share a banana let's split with her the creature that we need to get the last egg from is a deathclaw and it's kind of ironic because death claws while being the most intimidating and formidable foe in the wasteland is probably one of the easiest eggs to get probably only behind the Manta sake to get the egg we fast traveled to the Great Khan encampment which is where we talked with Melissa earlier to get the quest that allowed for us to sleep with surprisingly white Tyrone at the encampment we just have to do one reload - forward and then a time stop to easily claim a deathclaw egg for ourselves followed by just dashing around trying to get a good launch that will allow for us the fast travel back to the thorne without needing to go too far away from the quarry finally back at the thorne we can turn in the deathclaw eggs and finish the bleed me dry quest line at the end of which we can request with Lucy to meet with us somewhere more private once in red Lucy's chambers we can hardly wait to interact with her all we need to do is push her closer to her bed and wait for her to change into her nightgown at which point we will interact with the bed ending the speedrun with a final time of 28 minutes and 38 seconds this run was a really fun run to do there's a lot of variety to it and it didn't really get stale at all when I was grinding out runs there's such a variety of glitches and just fun little quirks of the run and the route and the characters in the game that really could just talk about a non-stop in fact as I record this I realize now that I didn't explain the load remover in this run so that means that we're bound to get a good handful of comments complaining about why my timer was stopping during load screens but hey I'm not about to argue in YouTube comments over that instead I'm gonna prepare myself for a night out on the town with the tools provided and the manscaped perfect package 2.0 again use discount code tomato at checkout to get 20% off your order and free shipping but yeah that's about it this has been a Fallout New Vegas all sleeping partners speedrun I'm tomato anus and I hope you have an above-average day
