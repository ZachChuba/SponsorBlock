with state fair lemonade
that's right i am very excited to be showing you how to make real authentic
vintage lemonade the kind you might enjoy in a hot summer
day if one of those stands at the state fair
maybe while you're not on a corn dog or funnel cake and while everybody thinks
they've had lemonade before unless you've had it made using this
method you actually have not not even close so with that let's go
ahead and get started and what we're going to need here are
six of the finest lemons you can find which i've washed very thoroughly and if
yours seem kind of waxy you might want to give them a pretty
good scrub under hot water since the whole key to this recipe is using the
peel and what we'll do first is take a
vegetable peeler and peel the zest completely off all these lemons
right not too too deep mostly we just want the yellow part
but if there's a little bit of white attached that's totally fine
and if you've ever wondered why the lemonade at those stands at the state
fair or the county fairs is so much better than ours
well this recipe is going to show you why okay most of us just make lemonade
out of lemon juice but as you might know the oils in the
lemon peel contain a tremendous amount of lemon flavor
and if we can somehow extract that and add it to the flavor of the juice
we're going to end up with something far superior so what we'll do is peel all
those lemons as shown and of course we're going to save those
so we can cut them in half and squeeze them later
and then to our bowl of lemon peels we're going to go ahead and dump in our
white granulated sugar and then we'll give that a thorough mix
and what's going to happen here is this sits
is that sugar is going to pull out all those essential oils from the peel
and then we will use the sugar to sweeten our lemonade thereby introducing
all that lemony goodness into our drink so a very simple trick but devastatingly
effective so once we have that mixed what we'll do
is cover it and we'll let it sit out from anywhere between 2 and 12 hours
in a little longer it's probably better but 2 hours is fine
at which point your sugar and lemon should look something like this
and what this mixture is actually called by ancient romans
or contemporary williamsburg bartenders is oliosacrum
which yes translates to oily sugar and then what we'll do next is place five
cups of cold fresh water over high heat and we will bring that up to a boil and
then just as soon as that water starts to boil
we will turn off the heat and transfer in our sugar and lemon mixture
and we'll go ahead and give that a stir and then we'll simply let it sit there
for about five minutes or so or until all that sugar is dissolved at
which point we're simply going to strain it back into the bowl
and man do i wish you could smell this this stuff smells so good
and then the only thing this needs to finish it off is of course our fresh
lemon juice which we do not want to squeeze in while
this is really hot otherwise i think we might lose some of
that bright fresh lemon flavor so what we'll do after straining is just
let this cool down to room temp at which point then it's safe to go
ahead and squeeze in our lemons which i'm just going to do by hand through
this strainer although if you have one of those lemon
squeezers like i usually use that might work out even better
but anyway the strainer was right here so i used the manual method
and obviously if you want to adjust the amount of sugar or the amount of lemon
go ahead i mean you are after all the mr kincaid
of your state fair lemonade and it's up to you to manage your
family's business beverage related or otherwise
so you're definitely allowed to tweak the amounts and i've been known to
squeeze in a little extra fresh lemon juice because i like mine tangy
and that's it once our fresh lemon juice has been squeezed in we can transfer
everything into a serving pitcher at which point i like to cover it and
refrigerate it until very very well chilled
all right if you pour this over ice now and it's not super cold
it's going to melt the ice and maybe water down your drink
so i'm going to go ahead and pop this in the fridge for a while after which we
can pull it out and pour it over some ice and then we'll
enjoy probably the greatest lemonade you've ever tasted
all right we have that tangy fresh lemon flavor from the juice
along with that much deeper more intense more complex flavor from the lemon oil
which is what makes this a truly extraordinary beverage
so i think we need to update that saying when life gives you lemons
peel them first toss them in sugar and then make lemonade
oh yeah words to live by although there is one small problem i should warn you
about and that's that once you start drinking
lemonade made like this it is virtually impossible to go back drinking it how
you used to and you're going to need a really good
poker face when your friend hands you a glass of that non-authentic lemonade
because even though you're going to be smiling and say thanks your eyes and
body language might be communicating this is not everything it could be at
which point their eyes might communicate just drink it and stop looking at me
like that but anyway that's it how to make that awesome
old-fashioned lemonade that you get at those stands at the state fair
since pretty much all those have been cancelled this year we thought the
timing was perfect for showing you how to do this
which is why i really do hope you give this a try soon
