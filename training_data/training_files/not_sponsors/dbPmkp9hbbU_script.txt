it's been called the one true keyboard not many keyboards are still in use more than 30 years after their production began but the IBM model M is still a cult favorite and most of them work just fine even on modern systems in this video I'm going to try to explain why the model M is so popular and I'm also going to look at some of the different revisions are there really noticeable differences between silver label white label and blue label model M s what should you buy if you're in the market one of my first ever compete periences was on my friends dad's original IBM PC with its model F keyboard back in 1981 with this tool for modern times a person can quickly master such jobs as accounting or word processing even use the IBM personal computer to forecast growth all helping the business person at home to wear many hats while selling even more and that can be a feather in anyone's cap the IBM personal computer try one on at the store near you even then I marveled at the typing feel which was far different than the heavy somewhat clunky linear switches that were common at a time the tactility heavy-duty construction and yes the sound of that keyboard just put it in a higher class for me now when most people talk about the what they really mean is actually the enhanced keyboard model M's came in a wide variety of form factors but the enhanced keyboard is the standard 101 key layout the name enhanced keyboard should be a clue that it's the follow-up to something else that being the model F the model M is often associated with early IBM pcs but actually it was only a very late option on some 80 and xt systems it didn't start shipping with a new system until the debut of the ps2 IBM's follow-up to the original PC family hey everybody the no computers are here the new IBM personal system to the next generation in personal computing it's just what we need who's responsible for this right IBM introducing the new personal system to family from IBM talk to some real keyboard aficionados and they'll tell you that they consider the model F to be better quality although in terms of feel they both use the same buckling spring mechanism now the problem with the model F is its layout take a look at the model M a keyboard design more than thirty years ago now let's lay my Corsair k70 on top this is a keyboard design two years ago not only is the basic layout the same but even the size of the keys their angles and their placement is almost an exact match the model M pioneered this layout and with the exception of the addition of Windows Keys there have been no major changes to it in 32 years and Counting when you think about how much important work has been done on computers over the past 32 years and how much typing literally billions of people do around the world every day the model M is 101 key layout is really in one of the most successful designs of any piece of technology in history now it wasn't until 1998 that I bought my first IBM model M it was brand new and it cost me 15 bucks at a time when mechanical gaming keyboards hadn't yet caught on and the clicky tactile feel had become kind of outdated but I loved it and I used that same keyboard continuously for 17 years until it finally lost its place on my desk to a modern mechanical keyboard that I really got more for its looks than anything else but my model M is still around and it still looks and works as good as new now it's a legitimate question whether it's still worth buying a model M over a modern mechanical keyboard especially now that there are so many choices in 1998 when I bought mine the model M was it nobody else was making mechanical keyboards at all everybody had instead moved on to cheap rubber domes today a whole new generation has discovered the satisfying feeling of a tactile keyboard and there's now a cottage industry of makes and models out there including the Corsair k70 I have right here many of these offer modern conveniences like backlighting and media controls I really like the roller volume knob on my k70 but the short answer is that these are still a compromise in terms of typing feel they're clearly superior to any rubber dome but the key switches are gritty and plastic feeling compared to IBM's smooth and satisfyingly weighted buckling Springs and there's no consistency from one key to another on a modern keyboard the stabilized keys on most require more force suppressed than the non stabilized keys for just one example that was a huge no-no for IBM who put a ton of research into ergonomics now I do use a modern keyboard these days but it is a trade-off between mod cons and key feel the model M still offers the best key feel I've ever experienced and that's why I still have an obsession with it it's just really really good at the very specific task of typing rather than trying to incorporate a bunch of other stuff I became curious though if some of the things that I'd read online about quality levels among different revisions of the model and were true most of these boil down to earlier model M's being better than later ones now I'll put a link in the description where you can read more specifics about the many different part numbers of model m out there but for the purposes of this video just know that early model M's had a silver label these are the kind you could buy as a late option for PC a T or XT computers later model limbs that shift with the ps2 mainly had black logos on a white label and once IBM spun off their keyboard business to Lexmark in 1991 the logo changed to blue on a gray label now this gets kind of confusing because two of the models have black logos one has a gray label and one has what could be called a gray logo so it can be tricky to know what people are really talking about but just look at the pictures I already owned a blue logo model so I set out to buy a black logo and a silver label model and here they are and all their glory along with my modern Corsair first thing I did was weigh them we all know weights the true measure of quality right as you can see the weight did decrease over time mostly due to the large metal backplate that holds the internal assembly together being made thinner over the years just for kicks I also weighed my Corsair and I was actually surprised to see their weight about half that of the model ms it feels even lighter next I took a look inside the silver label keyboard had that thicker plate it has metal stabilizers under the larger keys and it has a large controller board just loosely clipped in behind the back plate and attached with two thin ribbon cables the black and white logo keyboard is similar but it ditches the metal stabilizers for plastic ones and it has the controller board bolted to the back plate my guess is IBM realized that the clips in the earlier design just weren't robust enough but my nuts and bolts were all detached and banging around inside the case when I got it so this design wasn't all that secure either remember this fact when I talk about the bolt mod later now the blue logo model M has a simplified board that sits in front of the back plate rather than behind it with the lock lights integrated into it I can't really say which design is best but at least a smaller front board seems less likely to get itself loose otherwise the plastic molds are all so similar that I doubt anyone would notice the difference but underneath you can see that the later blue logo model M mold is actually slightly thicker which seems to be the opposite of its reputation don't believe everything you read folks so they thin the backplate but actually thickened the plastic case oddly enough my black logo keyboard has longer feet but the divots for them on the case are the same size later Lexmark models also finally do away with the speaker grille something that hadn't been used for years early model limbs also have a detachable cable something that was an off-and-on feature all through the IBM branded model M days but it's more consistent on the very early model M s you can see that even my black logo model and has a permanently attached cable and it's not the nice stick perfectly coiled one that I bought separately for my silver label keyboard now this is a terminal model M and that's something you probably want to try to avoid if you're buying a keyboard for PC use and the cable does feel more like a telephone cord from those days the ps2 versions might be different for all I know blue logo IBM's generally have attached straight cables like mine although I've seen coiled cables and I've seen detachable cables too there's just less rhyme or reason to these things in the Lexmark years now let me just talk a little bit about Lexmark because they made the blue logo model m's from 1991 to 96 and there seems to be a lot of confusion about who these people actually were and why they were making model M's I see people actively avoiding these keyboards mostly because of the name they're not actually quote built by IBM which must mean they're built in some third-party Factory well actually Lexmark is IBM or really they were IBM in 1991 IBM decided they no longer needed to be producing things like keyboards mice and printers so they just sold the whole division to outside investors but the thing is the same people working in that same factory just kept right on doing what they were doing there was no change in production all that happened is that IBM got a big one-time cash payout and took some of that money to then pay that same division to keep making model M's for them sure Lexmark continued to streamline production with things like the straight cable and eliminating the speaker grille but they probably would have done those same things under the name IBM and these changes don't really affect anything about the feel of the keyboard so how about that feel well all three of my keyboards feel pretty much the same with that satisfying click enos the older ones are just a tiny bit scratch here but that could probably be completely fixed with some further cleaning I did have a black logo model M in the early 2000s that I ended up throwing away because it's sliders felt completely worn out and that does happen on these over time especially if you don't keep them clean my blue logo Lexmark keyboard that I bought new feels the smoothest out of all of these there is a very slight difference in sound between them now back to the bolt mod and this is starting to get close to a recommendation of what you should actually buy despite their reputation for toughness model M's all have one big Achilles heel and that's that the entire inner assembly is held together using plastic rivets these rivets degrade and fall apart over time I cleaned a pile of them out of both my older model M's when I first opened them up when enough of these go Keys will start not working and the key feel will change the purpose of the bolt mod is to replace all of these plastic rivets with metal and bolts which will ostensibly last forever but without even using lock washers I have my doubts that they'll last any longer than the plastic rivets and eventually you'll have a bunch of metal nuts and bolts floating around in your case which to me is a lot worse than little plastic nubs now there is a variation on the bolt mod using nothing but screws going in from the back that the engineer in me has a better feeling about these could still loosen over time but there's more thread biting into the plastic and the tension of the metal against the plastic should actually help the screws dig in rather than loosen the screw mod also has another advantage in that it's easier to do you technically don't even need to take the keyboard apart so I'm actually thinking to practice this on my terminal model M and then do it for real on my silver label model M my blue logo model M doesn't need it eventually it will but it doesn't yet so what should you buy well among the IBM branded model M s my suggestion is to buy whatever the newest one you can find is and don't worry so much about the color of the logo or the label if you can find a new old stock silver label great but that's really unlikely and if you did it it'd probably be pretty expensive and would still be in need of a rivet replacement the later blue logo model limbs are not likely to yet need a rivet replacement though so I consider it a bit safer to buy one and there's really no difference in feel you can also find pre modified refurbished model M's on eBay for ridiculous sums of money and if you want to go and mortgage your house for a keyboard then be my guest some people are doing screw mods and calling them boat mods just for familiarities sake and if you are going to buy one of these I would actually seek one of those keyboards out now there is kind of an elephant in the room here and that's you know comp unit comp bought the rights and tooling from Lexmark in 1996 and they make model M's to this day I'll have one of these eventually and I'll bring you a second video comparing them to IBM branded model M's Unicom definitely is a different company though running on a much smaller scale with tooling that's now thirty years old so I feel like it's a little different subject a Unicom model M might be similar but it's not really the same animal as an IBM model M and I can't really judge them the same way now I could be wrong and if I am I'll definitely let you know once I get one of these keyboards so that's it for now the model M is still a great keyboard it's a real classic and it's something that still is useful and satisfying as it ever was go out and get one if you haven't already but just remember that there's nothing especially different about it than any other product look for one in the best possible condition and don't get hung up on the color of the logo or the label happy typing
