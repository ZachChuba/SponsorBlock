sponsored by curiosity stream so you're planning to buy a new MacBook for work for school to be more productive to be more creative to better do what you currently do or to start something completely new but you're just not entirely quite sure yet which one to get well I'm Renee Richie and this is the video for you last year the MacBook lineup was far more complicated the differences far more nuanced and the choices far more difficult now Apple has updated cleaned up and improved almost everything and the result is the cleanest MacBook lineup in half a decade maybe more so if you just want a MacBook you can take pretty much anywhere and do pretty much anything with and portability and price are your priorities then you've got the new baseline the new MacBook Air if you want a good mix of Portability and power and you're willing to pay a little more for it then you have the entry level in higher-end 13-inch MacBook Pro if you need power more than portability and you're willing to pay more maybe even a lot more depending on how much more power you need then you've got the brand-new 16 inch macbook pro now simple as that is there are some important things and a bunch of options you should know about each of these systems before you decide to make any of them your own so let's break them all down if you need a new MacBook and that's all you really know or care about if you're a student or teacher a jet setter or coffee shopper if you mostly use the web and documents photos and messaging get the MacBook Air it's not only the least expensive MacBook and Apple's lineup it's also the simplest you pick your color you pick your storage you pick your memory and that's it it's almost iPad simple for people who just want a Mac without all the fuss and that's what the MacBook Air is for everyone who wants a traditional computer without the traditional computer hassles here's what you get in your choice of silver space grey or gold it has an Intel twenty eighteen eighth generation amber Lake processor which is a more mobile friendly y Series version of coffee Lake it just doesn't run quite as fast or as hot and in tellyou HD graphics 617 which is you know Intel embedded graphics unlike most computers even most max there are no other options every MacBook Air comes with exactly the same 1.6 gigahertz dual core i5 processor turbo boost up to 3.6 gigahertz and that's it again like iPad simple it's got a 13.3 inch Retina display which means a person with average vision from an average working distance can't see pixels just sharp text and graphics though at 400 nits and srgb it's not quite as bright or as colorful as the MacBook Pro displays earlier this year Apple updated it with true tone as well which means it now has sensors to read the color temperature in the room and adjust the white point so it always looks wait not yellow not blue just plain paper white it's got a 720p webcam and three mics to support voice activated Siri and the new Mac OS catalina voice control it has two USB see Thunderbolt three ports one for power when you need it and the other or both for just about everything else though you'll likely need a USB a adapter or two as well at least for the still foreseeable future and it's got apples t2 security chip which makes it harder for anyone to steal or infect your stuff and also gives you touch ID which makes it easier for you to unlock or authorize Apple pay the base model starts at 1099 but you might be able to find it for Less over the holidays especially if you keep it locked to thrift or calm for that you get eight gigabytes of low-power ddr3 RAM on 128 gigabytes of SSD storage which yeah is on the low side I mean it might be fine if you do most of your work online stream most of your music and videos and especially if you use Safari instead of a ton of chrome tabs and electron apps if you want or need more breathing room you can go up to 16 gigabytes of RAM for an extra $200 and 256 or 512 gigabytes or one terabyte of storage for an extra 200 400 and 600 bucks respectively so you're looking at 1099 base to 1899 maxed out with a bunch of options in between but fewer and simpler ones than usual now there may be a comet Lake magic keyboard version of the MacBook Air at some point next year but for now the newly updated MacBook Air really is the new normal for everyone who like I said just wants a MacBook to take with them everywhere and do pretty much everything they need to do if you need a new map but but you need to do quote-unquote real work bracket TM close bracket if you're a pro photographer videographer audio producer or engineered designer or coder or aspiring to be then you want the MacBook Pro and if you still want some portability with that power you want the smaller 13-inch MacBook Pro here's what you give up the MacBook Pro is squared more than wedge-shaped like the air and a quarter pound heavier it's also got ten instead of twelve hours of web browsing battery life and you can't get it in gold here's what you get the 13.3 inch screen is the same size and density as a year but 100 and it's brighter and with a wider p-3 gamut it's more colorful also with all modern Macs and Mac OS Catalina with sidecar you can now hook up a modern iPad as a second display to give yourself more screen real estate even on the go if you need it processor options are well buckle yourselves in the new baseline model starts with a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core ace generation Intel Core i5 coffee Lake processor with turbo boost up to 3.9 gigahertz and Intel iris + graphics 645 that's at $12.99 for an extra three dollars you can go to a 1.7 gigahertz with turbo boost up to four point five gigahertz with those models though you only get two USBC Thunderbolt 3 ports if you want faster processors and more ports you'll have to move up to the higher end version though start at $17.99 but give you a 2.4 gigahertz with turbo boost up to 4 point 1 gigahertz or for an extra $300 at 2.8 gigahertz with a turbo boost up to 4.7 gigahertz you can go from 8 gigabytes of low-power ddr3 ram to 16 gigabytes for an extra 200 bucks but that's the hard limit on both the low power and the 13-inch right now alas for the 2 port entry-level model you can go from 128 gigabytes of SSD to 256 or 512 gigabytes or 1 or 2 terabytes for an extra 200 400 600 or a thousand bucks respectively which is still crazy expensive even with the price drops at the higher tiers for the 4 port model you can go from 256 gigabytes of SSD to 512 or 1 or 2 terabytes for 200 400 or 800 bucks also respected that also takes you from the baseline $12.99 all the way up to three thousand ninety-nine there will likely also be an updated tenth generation whatever Lake magic keyboard version announced sometime next year but for now if you want the best blend of Portability and power so you can get as much work done as possible while carrying around as little as possible be it photos video code in the air or on the road you want the 13-inch MacBook Pro if you need a new MacBook and time is money and power is worth any premium and you want the most power possible then you want the all-new full-on 16 inch macbook pro here's what you give up the 16 inch macbook pro isn't just taller and wider to fit in those extra couple inches of screen it's thicker and now over a pound heavier hitting 4.3 pounds for that extra weight though you get the biggest battery currently allowed by law which gives you up to 11 hours of web surfing battery life the 16 inch screen is the same as the 13 inch same brightness same gamut just bigger and with more pixels 3072 by 1920 instead of 2560 by 1600 processor options are extreme you start off with a 2.6 gigahertz 6 core ninth generation Intel Core i7 coffee Lake refresh with turbo boost up to 4 point 5 gigahertz and Radeon Pro 5300 M with 4 gigabytes of gddr3 99 for an extra $300 you can go up to a 2.4 gigahertz 8 core core I 9 Coffee Lake refresh processor with turbo boost up to 5 gigahertz for another $100 you can pump up the graphics to Radeon Pro 5500 M with 4 gigabytes of gddr3 and for an extra $2.00 you can go up to 8 gigabytes of ddr3 the bill to order options you can also find a 2.3 gigahertz 8 core ninth generation Intel Core i 9 Coffee Lake refresh processor with turbo boost up to 4 point 8 gigahertz for $27.99 and which could be better if your workload Peaks less and sustains more the 16 inch starts at 16 gigabytes of 26 66 megahertz ddr4 memory you can go to 32 gigabytes for an extra four bucks and as of right now a whopping 64 gigabytes for an extra $800 storage starts at 512 gigabytes now but you can get one to four or a brain bending 8 terabytes for 200 600 1200 or 2,400 bucks respectively ouch but amazing you also get a six speaker array which unbelievably sounds almost as good as a home pod and a three mic array which you can use in place of a USB microphone in a pinch so yeah that all still starts at $23.99 but tops out at 6000 99 now which is legit less than I thought it would be and is around the starting price of the new Mac Pro still that's a lot of options and a lot of money but if you're a hardcore keyboard clacking pixel pushing red rendering code crunching design daring doer your time is worth more than your money and you'll pay or just bill out your clients just about anything for performance then you want the 16 inch MacBook Pro and show okay so I know that's all still more complicated than you or me or anyone might like so again here's the cheat sheet if you just want a Macbook you can take pretty much anywhere and do pretty much anything with and portability and price are your priorities then you've got the new baseline the new MacBook Air if you want a good mix of Portability and power and you're willing to pay a little more for it then you have the entry level and higher-end 13-inch MacBook Pro and if you need power more than portability and you're willing to pay more maybe even a lot more depending on how much more power you need then you've got the brand-new 16 inch MacBook Pro and if even that is still too complicated just get the MacBook Air at least
