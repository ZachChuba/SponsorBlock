welcome back to my hardcore ironman only playable in pvp worlds the current bounty for killing this account is 100 mil plus my bank value sit back grab a snack subscribe if you like this type of content and enjoy the video in the last episode we started bossing and today it's time to start questing and i'm going to start with a very scary quest which is desert treasury it has a lot of multi-area so let's see how this goes i got myself a couple strange fruits for in the pyramid at the end and maybe in the smoke dungeon as well because i need to do a lot of running and that is the most easy one down that is the smoke diamond obtained so i was already scouted this early into the quest and i don't know what i'm doing in this clip um for some reason i equipped my tank armor and i stopped hovering my tap but yeah just watch the clip and uh you can roast me this was a really bad thing [Music] [Music] i was really close to a bank and i had a lot of food but keeping melee protect up in full tank not the best idea but that's a learning experience alright very dangerous place this is completely melty thanks to slayer music for showing the noted lockpick and food method because that saved me a lot of trips here i think i used around 30 lockpicks and there's the gilded cross let's get out of this place and get the next diamond i was actually doing the blood diamond but because c engineer is locking down uh the town i can't really go there right now so i have to wait and do it later and that is the next diamond safely obtained that's a shadow diamond let's make sure to pick that up and let's do the ice diamond next i guess i'm showing this camille uh kill because it's actually very important it has a four dough super restored drop and i'm in desperate need of supreme stores now that i have so many brews later on i will be using regular restores but it's just nicer to have some super easter so hopefully until i get the herbal level to make supreme stores i can actually use the ones from the quests but that depends on how many tank tests i have to do i guess but it's nice to get another one from the quest and that is the ice diamond completed so all we need now is the blood diamond and it's been like probably about an hour so i'm going to check if they're still camping the area all right i think it's a good idea to not go back there anytime soon i decided to do a ts run and there is level 38 tears of gothics very nice nice way to get the total levels up i guess alright we got all the diamonds i managed to get the blood diamond safely there was no one there i waited a day i couldn't find the clip but yeah the fight wasn't too hard and now we will do the pyramid which is a very annoying part i don't have like stamina potions so we'll see how this goes and yeah wish me luck [Music] all right there we go took me two tries not too bad i totally expected people in this room but doesn't seem to be anybody so there's a treasure completed and that is the ancient staff obtained as well very nice so apparently pimp and c engineer pm me later after the quest and apparently they were locking down this pyramid in all worlds i actually did it after the game update hit and they were camping there before the game update so i got pretty lucky imagine going through that maze and then teleporting out at the end that would be kind of sad but there we go that's a very very annoying quest out of the way and one of the requirements for barros gloves and that is 52 mining the requirement for a hero's quest i need 50 for heroes quest and 52 for the legends quest so that's all the mining requirements out of the way i will be doing those quests later and the heroes is also required for barrow's glove so we are done mining got a lot of total levels from this as well so that's very nice and there's level 80 magic very nice getting a lot of passive levels with the splashing lately the more magic levels they get the more magic defense so it's really important all right i decided to work on some skilling grinds there's 64 boot cutting and let me show you my bank i have 2700 nearly 2700 og locks and i'm going to turn all those locks into planks and that should get me the level for house tablets with a boost so that will be a very nice upgrade in the inventory i don't have to bring any runes and yeah i can just use house teleport so let's start working on that so one really annoying quest i have to finish is merlin's crystal because that's a requirement for the heroes quest and i know they were scribe pooling camelot so basically as soon as they see me go to the castle they know i'm doing the quest and they will go there so what i did was i went to the castle and i logged out for the day and then the next day when i woke up i basically continued the quest so i did this quest in a lot of different steps but this way it was the most safe all right so we are at the end part of the quest and they saw me running here and this is what happens so yeah we have to wait one more day so i'm training my construction and i'm constantly teleporting to camelot making planks and i'm going to try and bait them because i know they are watching camelot so i'm going to pretend to walk to the castle and i want to see if they take the bait and run after me so let's try this [Music] hey [Music] [Laughter] [Music] the plan worked well sc engineer said teasing the noobs and there's 59 construction with 1400 total already we're doing pretty good guys 1400 total on the pvp and then hardcore see final level 62 i had just enough planks to get this level i can now plus five boost with t and the crystal saw and make the lactone that i need [Music] and there we go house tabs unlocked on the account very nice upgrade dragon slayer i did this completely and free to play that way i didn't really have to bother with any pkers it was really peaceful so for the people wondering i didn't do this quest for the longest time because if you do this quest you can get dragons as a slayer task and i wanted to get at least 75 slayer which i got last episode for the gargoyle boss without getting dragons but now i don't really care anymore i should have the points to block dragons if i want and i definitely don't want to wait longer with barrow's glass so very nice to get that out of the way shield of araf completed which is potion completed vampire slayer quest completed doric's quest completed ali rescue prince completed corsac chris completed festracking from the deep desert all right we logged out for the day we should finally be able to finish this stupid quest and there we go merlin's crystal quest completed at six quest points and we are now up to 165 so that means we only need 10 and we have a few more quests to do so that should be perfect completed and i picked goldsmithing gauntlets because i have a bunch of gold ores from the geiger boss saved up and we can use that later for a lot of smithing xp and that's the most difficult part of the heroes quest completed i'm doing this quest with myself so no exceptions completely done in a pvp world i guess we have to do the quest later but i'm planning to do all the quests that require heroes quest in one session so they can check my xp that means i'm going to do all the miscellaneous kingdom quests the recipe for disaster quest and possibly the legends quest as well alright there's no one here let's finish the heroes quest let's see if we get some levels 49ers and we get a smithing level as well alright let's start this little questing session i guess there we go that's the throne of miscellaneous quest completed i can now start kingdom but i will be doing royal trouble too and there we go royal trouble completed i can now do maximum kingdom so that will be very nice for herblore and lox as well because that's what i'm going to put my workers on and there's the recipe for disaster part finished as well 170 quest points i now have dragon gloves so yeah let's finish the last bit of quest points and get myself the best in slot gloves in the game alright i decided to finish legends quest because it gives me four quest points so that only leaves one quest points and the xp reward is 30 thousand herbalor xp so i i couldn't pass on that that's legends quest completed and nearly 52 herblore and there it is the last quest required for beryl's gloves that's 175 quest points let's go kill the bosses shall we [Music] so [Music] there we go that's all the monsters down twenty thousand herbalife speed for level fifty three and there we go i can now buy bears gloves and that is a very very nice upgrade i never thought i was gonna get these this early i'm usually not a fan of questing but it definitely added a different dimension uh questing in pvp worlds but yeah that's some more defense bonuses so i'll take that all right i'm going back to barrows for a bit we left with 50 kill count let's continue until we get an item yes oh my god i have full tank
