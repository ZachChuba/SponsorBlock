(We know Yeri will love today's intro✨) Dduhi!⭐ Alrighty! I'm back as Red Velvet units! With Irene & Seulgi! Yerihan Bang - Part 2! It's time for Yerihan Photo Box & Music Box feature~✨ (Even VIP guests have to do it!)
(※Gotta cheer by themselves※) - I've read the script beforehand and you ladies brought some amazing songs for today!
- (You bet) (What's Irene's song of memories?)
Alright! Music cue! (Kim Kwang Jin - Letter) (Ddu Ddu looking shy as soon as the music started) I guess~ (DJ Ddu Ddu! Please sing first!)
this is the end~🎵 (Knows all the lyrics)
(Yeri got her mic(?)) She even memorized all the lyrics~ This is a song called  by our senior, Kim Kwang Jin (A great song that everyone, including Ddu Ddu, knows) Q. Why did you feature Kim Kwang Jin - Letter today? Yeah~ This song was *Kim Yerim's song she practiced during her trainee days
*Yeri's real name (Our grade-schooler Ddu Ddu's unique choice for song) I guess... this is the end... (Majestic DJ Ddu Ddu's shy moment)
Alright, so here's what happened (Ddu Ddu had to sing a song among trainees) (People expected a cute performance by a grade schooler, Yeri!)
They thought I was song to sing a cute song and out of the blue I GUESS... LOOOOOL (Ddu Ddu was super serious)
They started giggling...😭 (Gasp!)
They bursted into laughter.... (Suddenly felt like Try Not To Laugh Challenge...)
I thought "Why are they laughing?" but this song reminds me of those days It's not easy... to know that song (when you were a kid too) (She was indeed Oldrim ever since she was little)
If you think about it, she's amazing because (Can't forget)
she brought this song thinking about that old happening! (Irene picked this song in memory of that little Yerim)
I think she laughed the most LOL (Desperately wants to listen to Yerim's Letter again) (Singing Letter again in recollection of her memories)
I wish you can sing a bit for us (Letter - 2020 Yeri Ver.)
I guess~ this is the end~💗 I will now turn➡ away↘↘↘↘ Too low! (Super low notes right there...🕳) (Let's get the notes right) (Let's get the notes right - Not) LUL But I was... quite shocked back then!!! (Seulgi's type)
because I loved this song! - I didn't even know this song
- Oh, you've never heard it until I sang it? lol (Yerim listened to some classic ballad songs even unnie* didn't know)
Even I didn't know this song that well
*Older sister (used by females) Q. What was the most memorable appearance during each other's trainee days? (Explaining in a calm and orderly way)
(Irene explaining the life of SM trainees) (Uh oh...)
What will she say...?? LOL (Re-enacting Yeri from back in the days)
"This is the practice room" - "And this is a water purifier~"
- DON'T YOU DARE!!! (Voluntary disclosure)
A kkondae* grade schooler, Yerim
*A Korean slang used to describe a condescending person, usually older individuals Why are you explaining the water purifier? LOL (A grade schooler Yeri who went by the book tried to explain in detail)
A kkondae grade schooler Yerim! (Summoning the good ol' days)
Seeing that a little kid describing "This is a water purifier~" (That was so cute in my eyes💗) (Was overexcited for greeting a new trainee...)
Wanted to act like a senior... LOL (What was trainee Seulgi like to Yeri back in the days?) (Cutiepie) She had an apple hair (Bright greeting)
She was like, "Hello~~~😊😊" (Seulgi's unchanging, sunshine-like charms✨) (Irene) Remember her first impression? I do! Bright, very fair skin with silky, black hair! Her hair texture was so good too! (I guess she left an intense first impression lol)
Oh I remember! Her hair texture was unreal! (Irene didn't talk that much)
(because she didn't want to use Daegu dialects) She always sat down like this, quietly in the vocal room Turned around too! (Irene, who wanted to show off her silky, long black hair) (eventually makes a legend about 'The Ghost in the Vocal Room'... ⭐) Alright~ Time for Yerihan Photo Box! Seulgi said she prepared all the photos for today! First photo! WHOA!!! Good times... (Seulgi's first photo)
(A photo while Red Velvet was active for 'Bad boy' in 2018) You two filmed a music video as Irene & Seulgi duo, right? Q. What was different compared to shooting a music video as Red Velvet? (Since it's just us two) I thought it'll be much easier but it was actually harder than we expected... Oh... Really? It took a LONG time... There were so many scenes to film too.... :(( I also... You know... (Got you something, right?🙄) (Yeri offered sandwiches to support)
I told you to mention this! I talked about the music video~ (Yeri says)
(Spread my good deeds 24/7) Please film this expression! (The youngest being the boss) (You know how it works, right?)
Why do you think I brought up the music video?😬 (As if nothing has happened lol)
Your Yeri~ sent sandwiches~💗 to show her support to unnies~💗 (A good-deeds villan, DJ Ddu Ddu)
I'm this special, you see~☺ Eat your food and stay strong~ (Takes care of others off-screen but talks about her good deeds LOL) It was so touching💗 (Ddu Ddu's present made Irene reach high notes she's never hit before)
KIM YERIM DID? YERIM DID?!!!! (Satisfied👌)
I'll give you again next time! (Give and Taker 1) (Give and Taker 2)
When we'll be active during 'Monster', please give it to us EVERYDAY :) (Forget about it) Shall we look at the next photo~? LOL (Brings back the memories)
OH WOW! A group photo of us when we went to Slovenia (Irene standing out from her next-level excitement)
She looks so excited at the center LOL - Where am I?
- You are at 2nd last from that end! (Irene & Seulgi feeling the vibes of good old days)
Slovenia was really nice...🙄 Slovenia itself was such a great place! - Oh my oh my!!!
- Ahh~ We also (Ate together on Christmas!)
had a meal together around the year end! (Yeri & Seulgi approved)
We called her 'Best Woman of 2020 - Bae Joo-hyun*' 
*Irene's real name A gorgeous unnie who buys food for us💗 Buying food for 5 people is quite pricey (yet this stunning unnie pays like it's nothing...⭐) That photo... (My younger ones) You girls look so lovely~💗 (Sending a whole body heart💗 for the stunning sista)
We were all making hearts to send it to her (Bae Joo-hyun is a great unnie indeed👍)
That was a heart we sent after she bought us food, right? What is Seulgi's last photo of the day? (During 2019 Red Velvet 3rd Concert
-La Rouge!) We will hold another concert.... Right? (Let's meet again after things get better!💗)
If things can get better... (The moments that shined more brilliant because we were together)
I sincerely hope we get to meet everyone on stage... (We hope to see you soon...⭐)
We want to hold another concert! Q. How did you feel about today's Yerihan Bang with DJ Yeri? (Our youngest) is cute and funny too~ (Joohyun is proud of Ddu Ddu who is a great MC too)
I'm proud of her too~ I rarely appeared on reality shows but I think I felt more comfortable since Kim Yerim is the host (This is Ddu Ddu's big picture!)
I knew she would say that! 'I felt comfortable thanks to Yeri~' Something like 'Didn't even feel like I was on camera' (You know the answer, so just say it :)))
Alright, it's your turn now! Yerim~~~ honestly knows how to comfort others (Unnie #2 who is proud of the youngest)
so I believe Yerihan Bang is definitely a great place for Yeri...👌 Will you appear again for me?🙄 (Um... We should think about that) (Proud unnie #1 who knows how to dodge)
Well no! Since we appeared once...? You should invite others to see their charms now! LOL Oh!! I want the entire Red Velvet to show up! It would be fun if we invite them over! Then keep doing this until then! (Yerihan Bang becomes the next long-lived show!)
We should keep going! (VVVIP guests!)
We can't let Irene & Seulgi leave already!☺ (We didn't even see the real party yet)
We'll now go throw a legit party now👉👉 See you again next week at Yerihan Bang with Irene & Seulgi! Ddubai~💗 FLY!!! (We are fairies and we can fly~✨)
Fly! We have to fly!! (If you flew) LEAVE!! GO! The cutting ceremony to celebrate Irene & Seulgi's debut as a subunit (Seulgi, a woman of her words, throws a CROFFLE PARTY✨)

Right~ It's my first appearance~ (Irene & Seulgi sistas appeared as guests on the main episode) (I know!)
I've watched the preview! (Never heard about it)
There is a preview...? (Yerihan Bang's preview)
Are you nervous?! (=Everyone watched except Yeri)
Oh really? When was it released? (Yerim can't stay at her right mind when she's with other unnies lol) Why did you do when you two appeared? (We kept making fun of Yeri...) (Made fun of her... Made fun of her again...) (Red Velvet members oddly giving off real-sisters vibes) Made fun of Yeri~ Made croffles~ (She appeared to screw things(?) over at Yerihan Bang) HEY! What do you mean screw over!!!😂 I think it'll be really fun if we have Wendy over too! I know~ (Go go) Let's appear as Red Velvet next time!! We should all appear~ Will you show up for me?🙄 Of course~ (Joy already worried thinking she won't be funny enough)
Will it be funny though...? US? (Well don't worry! You got Ddu Ddu with ya!)
But~ We try different things all the time~ (Our) Ddu Ddu! DDU DDU!!!!! (Can't work things out her way again...)
UGH!! GOSH!!! (Roasting Ddu Ddu out of the blue was very effective!😫) (But) Why Ddu Ddu? (Yeri's Official = She's cute and got puppy like charms!🐶)
Like a puppy's name~ You know? Oh really? It's Ddu Ddu~😍 (Appealing to the camera)
I'm Ddu Ddu right now... (Unnies can't stand but make fun of her)
OOH~ I'M DDU DDU~ LOOL I'm Ddu Ddu in this world~ - Ddubai~😂

DDU BYE~~~ (Red Velvet gathered at the practice room after that sudden Ddubai)
Seulgi & Irene's!!! No, this is Monster!! (A special preview on Irene & Seulgi's most favorite choreography!)
There's something us two dance! One lighting, but why! (Harmony) are there two shadows? I was going to dance together~ but it's too hard~ I think I opened my eyes~🎵 (Unnies) So cool...👍 (Teach me something easy)
