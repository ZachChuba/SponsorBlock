[Music] wow really i've blown away i i've tried looting people through walls i swear it doesn't work what happens is it literally just does this and then closes their inventory i swear i've never been able to loot anyone through walls but i've seen people through walls all the time and i've again i've never been able to loot them oh wait maybe there's like a new like exploit with like a horse or something oh man well at least we have 421 scrap it here that's actually pretty freaking good for uh basically doing nothing but seriously i can get looted through a wall like that that is so dumb dude oh man i lost my tommy yesterday the dumbest way possible and then today i wake up to getting my tommy joint for me dude now that's brutal dude that is brutal but at least he actually left this note you know that that i appreciate that whoever did that props to you dude that's funny a big oh my god i don't think we're actually raided though oh my god oh my god we're not raided oh my god we're not raided nice dude now i'm happy about that unfortunately though now i don't have a weapon so i'm gonna have to make a campfire actually i'm going to do that real quick before i freeze to death it's so funny that he left the note that is actually kind of cool but at the same time as much as it's annoying i would have done the same exact thing i would have totally you if i could i mean i i really thought it was impossible but looks like he can but yeah i don't have any weapons left other than this guy so i think we're gonna have to use this um with these bullets i think i have more in here yeah so we're gonna have to use this gun over here unfortunately but yeah i i have a base design that i'm gonna make it's new guy around here i guess [Music] this is so fun i love this gun he's gonna come out and kill me i think but i love this gun dude with the suppressor this is fun it's so wrong but it's fun i hope i get to by us with it for a little bit probably won't but hey [Music] good enough for me i'm leaving i could so go deep into that guy's base but i just can't right now i needed this extra weapon all right let's grab the scrap and go back to base very good stuff all right let's make a tier two right now so i can make syringes i'm not going out until i have syringes dude here too let's go dude then we gotta get stone and finish up the base i'm excited alrighty it is morning let's go ahead and get some stone wow i am so far away and i haven't found a single stone node oh i see one over there two actually okay we'll go up on this side of the hill [Music] [Music] oh yes we needed years okay well now we're easily gonna be able to make like four garage doors because i know we have four gears guaranteed back at base maybe even eight but i think we really have only four um but i did see hesi guy up here let's just tell him since i was going to go up here anyways and it appears that it is not stone it is sulfur yeah let's let's go somewhere else to find stone i think we'll have to go down here actually where i used to live i think that's where i'm going to go oh hello what have we got here a horse very very hurt it seems okay well that's actually incredibly good but i heard someone i'm gonna come back beat it and we'll use it to go all the way over there to get some stone that's a good idea [Music] ah he took the horse i bet he didn't even bring any treats for it either he just took it and left i was actually gonna treat that horse right man that was going to be my best friend oh yeah um actually we're going to go over to the sewer or not stewart branch to my old base i want to go see if he took the time to raid me i honestly doubt it i mean like who would just actually keep their loot in a two by one like it would be a really dumb idea if he did try to rate it but let's just go find out i'm gonna go look after farm up this uh note right here [Music] i thought he was dead after that many shots but i think i hit a barrel uh that guy's probably stacked dude honestly i'm gonna go ahead and assume that he's probably loaded he just looks like he's been out farming for a while let's see oh no okay just springs not bad they always look at you with shock after you pick them up oh my god he actually rated it oh no that guy's oh no he raided it dude i swear i had enough in there there's no way i didn't dude that guy's probably so mad well he hasn't even upgraded his base or anything i feel like he either ragequitted yesterday and then someone else rated it or he tried rating it today and it was like you know what i'm done [Music] come on man what are you trying to do man all right well you know i don't really need a revolver but i suppose i'll keep it since you tried using it against me all right let's go ahead and grab my tommy where is it there it is and since we're making a base i'll try out the simple handmade on it here actually i'm going to slap a suppressor on here as well it does so much less damage and it's going to take like 10 bullets to kill anybody but it's definitely worth it because uh while we're building the space we don't want to attract anybody actually i'm going to go ahead and change my name i'm going to make sure that no one actually cares about me i don't want anybody to think anything about me i just want my own corner all right so i'm going to go ahead and do that i'm going to change my name [Music] oh no my head lerp is slow ew oh okay we're good so i think yeah i screwed this up well not really this is actually how i made my base in uh in a video you guys are gonna see soon damn look at that jumping hit that was kind of cool all right here we go [Music] excellent i'm happy all right now to figure this thing out this is going to be completely garbo but you know figure it out sort of so if i do this i should be able to destroy these without it that didn't work [Music] i should be able to destroy this now yes and then this is gonna be yeah it's already stone okay um yeah then we're gonna have to honeycomb the outside everywhere like literally every single side so we're gonna need so much more stone for sure you guys are probably like dude do this do that and i just i don't know what the heck i'm supposed to do but hey dude i'm trying and then over here there's gonna be a vending machine [Music] okay all right i'm gonna keep all this in here except the low grades instead i don't have to like remove that every single time but besides that we'll keep all this in here just to make sure it doesn't decay anytime soon yeah let's go ahead and place this down right over here all right oh oh we actually did sell something for 55 scraps so what was that that i sold i sold one 12 gauge like someone actually bought that nice he killed himself so fast decent still going to look for a bit more stone i don't need that and i don't need those and i don't need that actually oh there we go [Music] this is going to be extremely hard to honeycomb we'll have to like half wall it [Music] actually let's do the honeycomb process right now i think we might have enough for that [Music] that was a perfect amount but we still need to do the top so who's that guy who's that guy why is he running [Music] he was booking it dude now it's gonna look fine i do think we should add one more door right here though just to be extra annoying and also because it's gonna be way easier to get in yeah okay we're gonna do that but you know this means we need more stone i'm really going all out for this one yeah i think this is going to be awesome i like it i like it let's feed this horse and go down south fair play fair play actually i won't be able to uh do anything unfortunately i don't have um i kind of have a weapon no i need that mp5 i only have eight bullets dude no come back here you rat eight bullets in a dream man eight bullets in a dream this guy is so hidden they really just freaking run like what he just disappeared [Music] he might be dead oh i got him damn dude this isn't even you it was carl i don't want carl i don't like carl yes okay that's gonna be our weapon for now then i don't really like the python but you know what i don't want to craft another smg so i'll take it [Music] he ended himself pretty quick oh all right carter thank you i think he lives right here so he's gonna come out really quick well we lost the custom but we got two pythons out of nowhere i'll take it dude that's that's decent to me now it was around this time where i started dealing with a lot of door camping by two players in particular one of them specifically was really bad and was constantly coming back and just being annoying while i was upgrading my base nice [Music] yeah this guy's so annoying oh my god you didn't expect the sneak attack man well anyways hopefully this guy can stop being annoying it was unbearable i'm not gonna lie i can't stand getting door camp for so long i even got into a heated argument with that person and that made him a little angry because he started doing something that no one likes he started saying that sandy blood is on the server and was trying to tell everybody my coordinates now luckily to my surprise he did not do that because there was a few people on the server that were nice and were actually telling him to not do that and that it would ruin my entire wipe which is true but not only that it also causes some issues because this is a solo only server and you know obviously there's going to be some people that will listen to him and go to my coordinates and that means a lot of people in the same area which could also lead to some teaming which is uh very bad but anyways long story short since i didn't want to put this on the video which is way too much footage this video would end up being like an hour long i lost a couple weapons from being door camp for two hours i just wanted to upgrade my base [Music] that was too close he has some gears and some stuff all these like door campers and stuff dude it's insane they're all like grubs are out here right now and it's so annoying man bro you are so unbelievably annoying dude dude they're actually getting to me now i'm actually getting slightly tilted look at this guy man they're all over the place screw off man find something better to do [Music] bro i think i'm done for a while i can't dude i i actually can't i'm losing brain cells at a rapid rate right now it's it's actually insane yeah you see what i'm saying it i i can't do this dude i know you got me hear me out can you keep door camping this guy because he literally just sit on his roof every time every time now he's coming out he just sits on his roof no i went on my roof once he sits no no no no every single time every the custom the custom that you're going to keep in your base the whole way oh boo hoo i lost the costume hey at least he doesn't set his base the entire wipe and you're not even that good i don't i do i don't care if i'm not good i couldn't care less if i'm not good brother i've been i've been building a base and you've been door camping and then you're wondering why i'm not coming out you guys have been door camping me obviously i'm not gonna come out if you're door camping me you're kind of dumb i'm dumb because you guys are door camping me and you're literally saying you're not coming out of your base no [ __ ] sherlock you're camping me what do you want me to do so i got off took a bit of a break changed my name got back on and they were finally gone and you know i really don't appreciate getting door camp for so long especially when i'm just trying to get my base set up i'm not even going out of my way to do anything bad like roof camping or anything i just wanted to get my base done so i did what anyone else would do i farmed up some sulfur and got ready to raid him [Music] perfect so this will be the main like loot room i guess because this is going to be very protected alright we are done with the roof wow another 180 scrap that's amazing [Music] so [Music] thank you [Music] fun [Music] huh so what i've been planning is to just blow through his roof since there's literally no honeycomb so it should be as easy as that but not really sure where i'd like to blow blow through but is that it oh i was expecting like like i didn't know it was gonna be so hollow in there um hold up is this i kind of want to get up there i'm going to get some wood and i'm going to build up there i think i can just do it with some twig if that's literally what it is i think it's just a 2x2 expanded into a bigger base but like without any honeycomb uh and i should probably make a tc just in case we do blow through and have the tc [Music] oh i thought i saw someone yeah so like by the looks of it like all of this is hollow inside and then it's just this two by two that was expanded which is very like strange because there's literally no honeycomb in the back here so definitely not a strong base but it's still going to take 10 satchels because i think it would be a lot more if we go through the doors assuming that there's more than uh three in total yeah there's definitely gonna be more than three at least one or two over here and then another two over here which is more than how much it would be to go through a wall so i think what we're gonna do blow through the roof over here somewhere maybe i either this one or this one let's just get it going while the area is pretty quiet i feel like we're gonna get some people though for sure [Music] um all right i think we're good maybe some stone would be nice well we're gonna go with this i i mean i feel like it's gonna be a pretty easy raid in all honesty just it's literally not honeycombed anywhere it's like the weakest space around here it looks like um all right here we go i guess man i'm scared actually okay [Music] oh that bear's running there could be someone there i really hope that bear was just chasing off something but not a person really last one and tc all right let's go ahead and blow through oh wait oh okay i didn't check if i could get off but it's good it was actually locked uh do i oh this might be literally so stacked okay this is gonna be pretty easy to like fix up the roof or whatever oh no i didn't make a freaking hammer dude do you have a hammer in here some bullets oh another box broke in there i didn't see that oh all right that is uh that is some that is a great start to this raid okay um i'm gonna add another door right here though [Music] now i feel like the rest of the raid is pretty straightforward the doors literally lead right here so like considering there are doors right here this is probably not a loot room uh if there weren't doors it would have been all open i assume but since there is a door right here the next loot room is either gonna be in actually there might just be one in that corner and then one in that corner right here i mean we're going to find out i'm going to go ahead and continue this raid now what's in this oh i thought that was extra stone i don't know why but we have a lot of stone set oh a component box with a red key card 715 gunpowder that's gonna oh three smg bodies that's gonna help us make three more uh smg so that's nice all right let's try to make it back with this without dying and hopefully and oh my god i need this metal too actually holy crap let's put that all in the tc dude we only have eight hours of decay so i want to make sure that this thing can last all wipes since we're only on the second day here look at that dude [Music] i was kind of hoping the 2x2 would be all open but i assume if he'd you know expand this much he'd at least see the bare minimum of adding some doors inside of it [Music] okay perfect okay now in here i see that it's like completely open with an oil refinery that's kind of sketchy but uh i mean what else is there for me to take in this little place right here i i don't think i'm gonna waste my explosives going through two more doors just for a chance to get like you know maybe a lot of scrap from the research table or something i don't trust that so i'm not going to bother going through that it would just seem like a waste that'll do oh there's some uh there's some good action over there i think it's oh yeah there's a cradle chain right i was gonna say i think it's chinook oh all of this charcoal actually we kind of needed that the furnaces haven't been giving me too much so that is nice okay that's gonna be the first run and i think i'm just gonna come back next time with uh four satchels to go through the store i'll probably have to make another four satchels or i'll use the explosive bullets with the n39 unless i am able to craft up eight satchels in total we already have three so if i can do that oh yeah with all this uh gp we might be able to okay uh so with all that gp that was enough literally for those eight satchels in total that was a lot cheaper than i expected i don't know why i thought it was gonna be way more so we're gonna have another like 2 000 gp left over we're gonna have to block off this entrance right here since that's where his two doors lead because his bag is inside the base so blocking it off doesn't really do anything to stop him so yeah we definitely need to do that because he could just get on get in take all the loot from here and then hide in this other loot room or oh i can actually pick through this you know what i'm just going to go through the doors i want to make sure i completely wipe this guy so i want to go through everything in this 2x2 there's another door like right here on the other side that we can just pick through this all right well here we go this is going to be a little scary level one a little bit of sulfur not much oh there he is and a level two and he oh not bad a little extra low grid field to feed my uh syringes but yeah we can 100 pick this now okay there's no point crafting another four satchels for this even though it's not that much for me to be honest since i can farm a bunch of sulfur around here very very very fast actually you know what thinking about it i could literally farm up enough sulfur for four satchels in way less time than how long it would take for me to pick through that wall i feel like [Music] that's what you get wait is this carter it is okay good to know i didn't even check his name all right so i actually heard someone outside in the snow i know this for a fact i 100 heard someone well i guess i'll place this box down right here since he won't be able to access it once we place down a double door right here [Applause] all right let's uh let's get out i i know there's someone here so i think about to get blasted man oh my god dude i swear there's someone out here unless you can make snow sounds from inside your base actually i think i know what it is i think it was this little thing right here yeah i think this is going oh no no oh my god that guy scared me so much i literally just bashed my keyboard with my fingers dude with all my fingers oh he's not dead he's not dead i started reloading oh my god the double whiff dude now he knows where i live oh my god you [ __ ] [ __ ] you're so [ __ ] mostly you stinky you're [ __ ] cheating is what it is you're the cheater from earlier oh my god [Music] where would he oh there he is [Music] if you don't know that guy that was right outside my base is the same person from the last episode i think where he raged like crazy and called me some pretty bad words oh yeah he is outside right now [Music] oh no oh no he's raiding my two by two oh no wait actually that's that's really that's really really really bad oh no i have all my loot in there i think do i or did i transfer i think i transferred but that is not great at all well i guess i have to do this [Music] [Music] uh he patched it i think did he nope he didn't okay now he's gonna be triggered bro i just had to blast him dude okay well i guess we'll take all of this and all of that uh okay i actually transferred everything i didn't even need to do anything like that [Music] dude poor guy he was coming here with the db and everything and then i just blasted him dude he's gonna come raid me now man all right well if he has to do it he has to do it i'm gonna defend my base [Music] there he is dude he is not he's happy someone an idiot he's dude he's so bad a guy that has nothing on him every fight this guy encounters and then loses he freaks out dude he just hates everything oh my god it's so like it's actually worrying i'm scared for this guy man i feel like he's gonna like i don't know i think it's hilarious so after that failed attempt from that guy who by the way changed his name and identity completely i guess he saw my last video and it was like oh no i better change my name uh dude i just i don't respect anyone that's like that he also has a youtube channel i'm not going to go and death about this i don't want to expose him or anything but he does have a youtube channel a pretty big one and uh he's gotten banned before off twitch and twitter for racism so it's like dude how bad can you be anyways fast forward about an hour i now have a bunch of pickaxes crafted and i'm heading back to the base to finish the raid let's get to it can you not like soft side pick a wall anymore i'm confused hey kid you actually not i just afk while picking i have two broken picks and nothing has happened like dude how three pickaxes and it's not even close to broken right well let's uh here actually let me test something dude what see that's what it's supposed to be it's one damage per hit why is this not a damage per hit what's is this a visual bug or something it has to be with the triangle it has to be that like i i have no idea man yeah i don't really understand what happened there i figured it would just work but uh if you guys can let me know in the comments why i couldn't pick through that soft side wall i would appreciate that but yeah i went back to base crafted four satchels and came back to finish off the raid boy do i hope i don't get raided tonight man uh well not tonight i'm actually gonna go back to bed for like five hours and uh it is currently noon so there you go okay uh uh ah i mean that's something night vision i guess we can wear that for what we oh oh that was like that was worth every single satchel there dude like literally if if i only got an ak from this entire raid i would have been happy because really i just wanted to get rid of this guy but now we have an ak i am researching that tonight before i get off for a couple hours so not tonight i keep forgetting it's 10 a.m or 12 i don't even know what time it is anymore but i'm gonna research this thing dude i finished off the night by transferring his loot over to my base and also added some items to the shop uh let's put away all this stuff check how much scrap we have in total sort out some stuff put it in the vending machine the good stuff then i'm gonna get off for a bit but yeah let's go check out the shop right now i'm definitely gonna do that and i'm gonna sell explosive bullets rather for oh why does it say one screw i are you saying that this whole time this was this was how much i was selling it for so that's why they all sold out why do i always have to screw up the shops man and that is where this video ends off i'm sorry for rushing the end a little bit it's just because i want to make sure i can get this video out today it's going to be very late when this comes out since this will take about two hours to render and then 30 minutes to upload but yeah thanks for watching i appreciate it and that's it [Music] [Music] you
