there is no confusion i will showcase exactly why people come here on a pvp world step 1 player dies and loses ava's accumulator step 2 player realizes he have no more avas accumulators in bank step 3 player takes out cash and steal arrows step 4 player teleports into drain or manner and forgets to hop from a pvp world and step number five player dies to me and loses money and i'm so eyeballs this time coins on the ground 851k respectable amount 1.3k steel arrows but there has been one level 79 he said drop cash how much cash is that 1.2 mil we gotta kill him too he's smarter he's my dead come
