[One, two, three, four] [What?!] [There are not enough drinks for everybody...?!] [What should I do..?] XX doesn't want this, you don't want this. [Looking for a person who doesn't want the milk in a haystack.] Anyone else? SOLAR: Umm.. This is how you do it..? SOLAR: I found something strange. SOLAR: We are missing one here.. [Empty] We are missing one here now. [empty/Who is it? Come clean]
This is absurd, we are missing only one here. [Going back to distributing the drinks]
Okay, we can do rock paper scissors, and we can drop two people. You can ask someone who cares about you to share drinks. Should we try this way? Staff: Let's play the Timing Game. [Yay/All excited in the morning]
Timing Game! Wait, wait. Hey all, we are going to start the timing game soon. Ready~ - Go!
- 1! [We have losers already from Avengers!] [Aren't I cute?] [Staff: lol..] SOLAR: Why did you say 'Oh...'? Staff: No..No, I didn't. [Do you like green? / Staff:Hahaha]
What? SOLAR: Why are you laughing out loud..? (teasing) [It's morning and I speak gibberish]
You know, I always lead the trends.. [Cheating]
Patum? Color trend.. SOLAR: It's one of colors of the year.. [Pose inspired by sprouting green onions] SOLAR: I have so many ideas [You did your ending pose today]
Ah... SOLAR: It was not easy to do it with the black sauce on my lips, but I still tried. [I actually just wanted a small heart..]
Kuku SOLAR: Pieces of confetti fell on my shoulder really hard earlier. [confetti]
They landed right here and I got ride of them. [She has quiet good reflexes]
I removed them real quick thinking SOLAR: 'nothing can stop me' and walked on. [Selfie time in the waiting room] [All of a sudden..?] SOLAR: Look, I did this. [Solar loves apps] SOLAR: It goes around and tells you 'In the new year, I will be ___' [Solar's 2020 resolution...?]
It says 'I will be a dork' [(1theK-She was in it)/Moomoos love it when you use bad words...?]
Saying bad words? You **** [No, not to Moomoos] [Giggles] [She is showing what Moomoos love] [It's time to cleanse your contaminated ears] [I am proud] [Different uses of green onion dress]
Spinning green onion song [Ending mini heart epilogue] SOLAR: I am so grateful. [For what? / looking around] SOLAR: I am just thankful. [She looks refreshed!] [Your outfit looks comfy]
Yes, they are super comfy and it drives me crazy. For real.. [Guess she meant they are really comfy]
Love.. [This place has good lighting] It's photo time! They are having a photo time and I am having a fantastic time. [What are you looking at] [They look like Dippin Dots]
One, two, three~ Looks good [I like it] It's nice SOLAR: It's too early in the morning.. [You look like a circle drawn with a math compass] [According to Solar]
I sometimes don't like that I am round. [Like triangle rice ball]
I want to create an angle like this [Can you open your eyes?]
It's too early in the morning.. [You look great today!]
Today? Do I? [What do you do to boost up your mood?]
I can do it in a second. [Secret to pump up your energy from Solarsido's 1 year expert]
I have been with Solarsido for a year~ When I turn back, I change right away. [Let's turn around]
Solarsido! [Small congrats / Congrats on having 2 million subscribers!]
Happy 2 million! SOLAR: Does anyone have a Youtube channel? 200 people. Solar: Please subscribe and like. [grinning]
Do it! [I can’t / feeling shy now that she has the chance] Cute. Cute girl~ [hiding] Solar: She’s hiding. Cute girl. Solar: She’s cute. Solar: I was also a little shy to say ‘please subscribe and like’ so I didn’t like saying it, [officially from Solarsido / can say subscribe and like a hundred times like it’s nothing]
but now I can say it a hundred times. Subscribe and like~ [dignity of a 2M subscriber Youtuber.] I can automatically say it a thousand, ten thousand times. [listening]
Solar: If you constantly upload two videos a week, Solar: you’ll automatically say ‘Subscribe and like.’ - The tip of a 2M subscriber Youtuber!
- 2M says to 200. [Solar showed off her voice...] Everybody!! [Why did you do that...?]
Nod your heads. Solar: Do it up front. I said everybody! But it was quiet. [the situation was a little embarrassing...] [focus] [happy] Good job everybody! Good job. [Solar is playing games with the staff again at break time] Solar: Where should I put this...? Guys... Solar: Finally this day came for me. [looks like she’s going to win first place looking at her pose]
What should I do? [happy]
Staff: The time is passing (stern) - Cold.
- Rummikub. [relaxed] [look at them~] Solar: The time is passing~ tick tock tick tock. [relaxed now that she’s not the last]
The hourglass. [teasing without limit]
Now, you two, stay nervous~ 5,4... [Solar is now....?]
3,2,1, done! Rummikub! [Quite fun...!] [mad]
Solar: Oh, my head hurts, using all the brain. [Brain hurts] [second round starts!]
It began! I’m in charge of the hourglass. Solar: It’s more fun when I watch this~ It was also more fun to me when I was watching. Solar: Oh, you’re sensitive. [urgent situation]
Wait I didn’t go yet. Don’t teach anything~ I’m sensitive. [Sharp eyes] [glance] [becoming more and more frustrated]
- This is irritating.
- Oh no I think I’m going to lose. [blaming the numbers]
The numbers are a bit vague... No wait she has something. [the opponent looks a little relaxed?]
She has something, she has something now (urgent) Staff: There isn’t much time! [What do I do...] [breath tightening!]
Tick tock tick tock. Solar: Aha, okay! [Got a best move?!] Staff: Is is okay to put it down now... Solar: You have a joker, right? I’m nervous. Very nervous very nervous~ [You were just as nervous three days ago...] [opponent’s turn] Solar: Oh you have a lot left? [Solar doesn’t keep a poker face!] Staff: She has something to put down! (Suspicious) Do you really think so...? Me...? Solar: You can think whatever you like. [She earned the world like that] I won! I won guys! I won! I survived this Rummikub game... [quietly excited]
I’m the one who survived. [playing games and monitoring...] Solar: Everybody! Solar: Whoa! (grin) Why do you like it so much. Solar: The first week is over. (Suddenly calm) Solar: Thank for waiting for me, Moomoo. Solar: I was really nervous on the first stage, but I’m becoming more and more relaxed. Solar: It’s a little sad that I couldn’t meet you on stage, Solar: but I hope someday we can communicate together on stage. Thank you. Thank you~ Moomoo.
