this video is supported by Squarespace Peter and Myra Welton were a retired couple living in Hall England in 2009 just enjoying a nice weekend afternoon with their grandkids when suddenly a loud bang shook the house Peter went up into the Attic to see what happened and he found that something had smashed a hole in their ceiling and right below that was a smouldering hunk of metal it was so hot they had to carry it downstairs with oven mitts they shared this with the police who had no idea what it was the police shared it with the British military who were just as confused this weird hunk of metal finally made its way to NASA who were able to confirm that yeah it was a piece of space debris from a satellite that burned up in the atmosphere and it just happened to land on their home unlucky for them obviously but luckily nobody was hurt and they got a good story out of it and they got to keep it the Wilton story is not altogether unique though between 200 and 400 pieces of space debris fall through our atmosphere every year now of course most of it burns up in the atmosphere and most of the world is uninhabited so the chance of getting hit by one is very very slim ironically though the fact that all that stuff is falling down from space is actually a good thing that's exactly what you wanted to do the real problem is that so much of the stuff we've put up there has never come down a problem that might not just keep us from progressing as a species but if we don't do something about it soon could set us back decades last week marked the 61st anniversary of the launch of Sputnik the first satellite in space now Sputnik didn't do much more than just beep but the hundreds of satellites that followed eight have completely changed our way of life from instant cell phone communication to Internet service to broadcast TV GPS the list goes on and on but along with these wonderful transformative satellites we've also put a lot of other stuff up there empty rocket stages various equipment nuts and bolts literally nuts and bolts nuts and bolts flying around at 17,000 miles an hour over 10 times faster than a speeding bullet just a quick primer to enter orbit around the Earth you actually have to travel perpendicularly to the direction of gravity by 17,000 miles an hour in order to enter a state of basically perpetual falling that's why astronauts are weightless in outer space is not because gravity isn't working on them anymore it's because they're basically constantly falling and never hitting the ground you know we see these videos of spaceships docking in orbit it looks like they're just slowly floating towards each other until they lock into a lover's embrace about the clouds like a slow-motion ballet which was perfectly depicted by Stanley Kubrick in 2001 sets of Blue Danube [Music] when in actuality Slayer would have been a better choice of music because in order to dock with something in space first of all you have to get into space which is in the treatment all its own but then you have to travel up to 22 times the speed of sound to get caught up to the same speed as that thing that you're docking with before you can start doing the whole dance not to mention timing your launch and trajectory just right to reach the right orbit and the right destination there's a reason why they call this rocket science so the problem isn't just that there's a lot of stuff floating around in space the problem is the speed at which that stuff is traveling because the kinetic energy of an object is the square of its velocity so if an object is traveling 10 times that of a speeding bullet it actually has 20 times the kinetic energy of a speeding bullet and just in case you need a reminder getting hit by one speeding bullet is bad I'm taking a minute to talk about this because these are speeds and energies that we can't even fathom we literally can't experience that here on the ground we literally can't anything traveling at that speed at sea level would instantly vaporize right now these objects are buzzing around the satellites that make our way of life possible how many you may be asking you might want to sit down for this right now there are more than 750,000 pieces of debris floating around out there that are currently being tracked by various agencies around the world including the Air Force vast majority of these objects are between 1 and 10 centimeters in size with 16,000 pieces larger than 10 centimeters many of these are spent rocket stages and dead satellites in fact only one in 10 satellites in space are currently functional satellites but just in case you haven't fully evacuated your bowels yet let's talk about the pieces of debris that are smaller than 1 centimeter also known as micro debris remember the episode that I did on plastics where I was talking about how big garbage patches in the ocean get broken down into micro plastics that find their way into our food stream and how that's the real problem well this is like that except those micro plastics are traveling fast enough to tear you in half and there is an estimated 150 million pieces of micro debris floating around in space too small to be tracked but carrying enough energy to do this this happened on the space shuttle mission STS 7 in 1983 and it was caused by a flake of paint smaller than 1 millimeter flecks of paint er especially rampant into space because these satellites and spent stages go out there and they've got paint on them and the Sun bombards this paint for years and years flexaway and ruins every Wednesday right now there's a similar crack on the couple of window of the International Space Station and images of Hubble solar panels show dozens of pock marks caused by micro debris right now space is basically a cosmic shooting gallery already this problem has been a headache for Space Agency's at least once a month the ISS has performed maneuvers to avoid a piece of space junk and every launch does it take space debris into account when making their flight plan is that there's not enough factors to consider already but these are just headaches the real problem was illustrated by former NASA scientist Donald Kessler in 1978 he proposed a situation where we get so much space debris up there that inevitably collisions would occur which we create more debris which would create more collisions which would cause more debris and then more collisions until you reach a point where there's so much debris up there it's impossible to launch anything into space without it being ripped to shreds earth would basically be encased in a shell of billions of pieces of flying metal making it possible to ever leave Earth no colonizing the Mars or moon no traveling the solar system we would be stuck here permanently on this planet forever oh and all those wonderful satellites that make our entire way of life possible gone he may have UB said back at least 50 years this became known as the Kessler syndrome an event like this was depicted in the movie gravity but the part that they left out with Sandra Bullock returning to a planet that doesn't have any internet or cell phone service in this process of debris creating collisions creating more debris has already gotten started in 2009 the iridium 33 satellite the u.s. communications satellite smashed into a defunct Russian cosmos 2251 satellite and a speed of 26,000 miles an hour creating more than 2,000 pieces of space junk across a debris field thousands of kilometers long and now multiple occasions the crew of the ISS has had to retreat down into the Soyuz capsules as they pass by this debris field you know just in case but as humans we aren't content to just lay randomness and chance Bork things up for us no that's way too slow so we've taken things into our own hands in 2007 China conducted a test of an anti-satellite missiles system destroying their fy1 see weather satellite with a kinetic impactor creating an estimated 150,000 debris particles cuz yeah screw that satellite actually was a test of their ASA admissible a set stands for anti satellite that's just the class of missile the country is used to shoot down an enemy country's satellite and before you start thinking too badly about China just keep in mind that the United States did the exact same thing in 1985 back at the height of the Cold War our strategic defense initiative the u.s. tested their ASM 135 a set missile by blowing up the Seoul wind P 78 one satellite creating several hundred pieces of debris from that but perhaps the dumbest thing ever done in regard to space debris was something that the US military did called Project West for it in 1963 okay so today if you want to send a signal to the other side of the world you bounce it up off of a satellite and it gets ricocheted back down to where you want to contact somebody of course this did not exist back in 1963 so the US military wanting to have that ability to do that decided to get a little bit creative they figured out that if we created a halo around the planet made out of tiny copper wire we can maybe bounce a signal off of that kind of like an artificial ionosphere so they launched and dispersed into orbit around the earth four hundred and eighty million tiny copper needles the good news is the project worked the bad news is a project worked most of the needles by now have fallen back to earth but some of it is still up there to this day now clump together into bigger pieces of space debris now I've talked enthusiastically on this channel about how private companies like SpaceX and rocket lab are democratizing space and making satellite technology available to more people than ever before I've extolled the ingenuity of India's space program and their ability to put 144 satellites up and only one launch it's a new space race I've said so many times it makes you want to puke and this is awesome and amazing but let's just get real for a second are we just making this problem worse now there is a group called the interagency space debris Coordination Committee that has proposed some guidelines to help keep this problem in check and they include a maximum orbital lifetime of 25 years a mandate the satellites have the ability to do orbit at the end of their use or the satellites be elevated into designated graveyard orbits to minimize interaction with active satellites the members of this committee include NASA Ross cosmos the ESA the CSA is ro JAXA and many other state agencies around the world but at the time of this recording no private space launch companies and there are some plans in the works to get rid of some of the worst offenders and right now NASA has a plan called space debris illumination or also known as Spade which involves blasting bursts of air in the areas of debris which would slow down their velocity enough to send them back down towards Earth the ESA has a program called de orbit that involves capturing space junk with a giant net there's a concept called the electro dynamic debris eliminator that uses the Earth's magnetic field to drift toward defunct satellites and then guides them back toward the atmosphere with a giant net an idea from Texas A&M University called the ten use sling set actually uses the velocity of the space junk to propel it to the next piece of space junk releasing it back towards the earth as it goes and then there's a proposed laser orbital debris removal system that uses high-powered lasers from tracking stations on the ground that can zap space junk and either slow with the nur she enough to fall or push it higher into a graveyard orbit now all of these are interesting ideas but at the moment that's all they arse ideas they've all been stalled due to lack of funding but there is one glimmer of hope a project from the UK called remove debris which just last month was able to capture runaway CubeSat with a net ultimately the idea is to capture the debris in a net and then tow it back toward the earth but so far they've only tested the net now the towing mechanism but it works so I guess that's a start now the risk of sounding like a debbie downer this is a very tiny first step toward fixing a gigantic and overwhelming problem that should have been started ten years ago but yay many scientists think that we've already reached a tipping point on this that there's already so much stuff up there that it's inevitable that eventually we're gonna start to see this chain reaction take place unless some urgent action is taken you know I'll be honest and these videos always try to find some kind of surprising other side of the issue I try to find the contrarian argument that maybe people aren't expecting so I tried really hard to find just one article from one scientist that said that this was overblown that it's a problem that's gonna fix itself that it's not as bad as but made out to be and I couldn't find it literally not one we are entering a new era of space travel one where private companies take center stage and it opens up new opportunities we've never had before and this is incredibly exciting but it's incumbent on private and public industries to take this problem seriously and do some urgent action because without some kind of fast action on this it's all going to go away and it's gonna take all of our hopes and dreams about the future with it so get sponsoring this video and a big huge shout out to my answer files on patreon that help keep the lights on around
