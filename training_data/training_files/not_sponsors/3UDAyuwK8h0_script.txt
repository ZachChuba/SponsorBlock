give him metal teeth if it is the future long or short nails short long i like long long witch nails color you can give it a cool pattern like you give them scatters yeah give them scar nails yes do a fire yeah this makes me grab things faster nipples oh you can just turn them on or off oh i say off i'm sick of nipples and gains we don't need them how do you like the skulls it's so cool skulls plus the fire in the nails will repel any any any wrong dealers who want to harm us genitals p do both there you go give them a dick penis that's just how did does this affect our can you could show a flaccid [ __ ] on youtube right no no then how come people can do joking videos because it's educational tomorrow it's educational to watch a guy go oh i heard that if you give your character a circumcision you're like ostracized in the world really apparently i did give my character circumcision that's why you're not how does anyone [ __ ] know about your circumcised [ __ ] or is it like you just get people get weird when you try to [ __ ] them i don't know why does everybody hate on like i get hating on circumcision but i don't get hating on people who are already [ __ ] circumcised when they're [ __ ] six days old like they had a choice like because it's funny man it's like being ginger they can't help it but you still laugh at them i jews like myself all get circumcised when we're like i think it's six or seven days old i'm gonna get circumcised tomorrow just to prove a point nice good night can i do it okay but you got to suck the blood out of my penis after that part really is [ __ ] like i learned about that and i'm pretty sure that is real israel it is real like does that mean this means that some weird old man must have put his mouth on my [ __ ] when i was a baby i don't even want to think about that okay i think that's a cool character this is an upstate this is a nice tank citizen yeah i like it okay uh intelligence zero number one number one i don't think you can oh it says three is the minimum level of what's what's plus body what does that mean buffer what does that do it's it it gives you more health stamina makes you do more damage with a fist fist attacks and melee weapons decreases your movement penalty while grabbing an enemy okay yeah that sounds pretty epic yeah just give it that [ __ ] the rest of it no this guy okay what is going to make the game more actual yeah one yeah what you're told are you i think like reflexes tie into the hacking [ __ ] seems related to like intelligence and technical ability which is that this is the combat the normal combat seems to relate more to body and reflexes and then cool is just for like stealth [ __ ] now what are we doing more as the stress the cool street kids i say we just be a guy that pummels people that's what the future we just go on go up and body maybe go up a little bit reflex yeah just give them whatever's left in reflex that seems like it's a good and they're not cool and they're no they're not even intelligent because we have a little bit of technique dude this is like a real guy so he's okay that's good he's a little bit good he's good at computers but he's actually he's a stupid idiot alias wait is that really our name what's his backstory yeah v the character is always named v no matter what for vendetta i don't the backstory i think we're gonna they say if you want to understand the streets you gotta live no they'll give you the back story when we start that was written by somebody who's never been on the streets man like like us so we know the streets i know what it's like i know it's like that to get up at like 4 p.m and walk through the sun i mean chris you were telling me that story at 4 pm you told me about how that about that story about how do you uh you took that via these guys eyes balls out with your thumbs but then late you know you you became a you know since now you're sort of aware that you did that when there was no war going on the bag those are the 90s too well first of all it was with a spork it wasn't with my thumbs that's right you just got done eating i just had dirty you were a papaya or kfc i think yeah got done eating kfc and he took his spark and he said he stuck into that man's eyes well that guy sat next to me and he was doused in perfume and was pissing me off perfume yeah he was a perfume like upstairs on himself he was for people who don't know mike wahlberg google mark wahlberg took out a vietnamese guy's eyes that's what we're referencing is that really true i feel like that's he took it out with his thumbs that's my little fire oh this guy sucks ew the future really does suck i just looking to take you look at that set broken nose what does that mean you have a broken nose you either set it like set it like put it back into place yeah knock back a shot [ __ ] that man let your friend maybe drink before you set your nose let your nose [ __ ] run off just just drink your paint away okay now we set the broken nose what's that beautiful golden gauntlet he's wearing it's kind of ignorant i love thanos what the [ __ ] it just doesn't have eyeballs anymore i guess you want to tell us what happened with that whole thing nope wait is that the guy we were talking about go back no no that's a that's like a bouncer oh that's good i think he's got the same hair you know who that is who that actually does look a little bit like carlos would see a with the sun doesn't it this is like the alternate reality cool carlos mansion did somebody put his face next to carlsberg's face that is carl smith like kind of a built carlos mentioned if you've worked out really hard at a lot of protein what what is what's what if you want a truly dynamic machine oh little subtitles for the tv is that you're seeing that through your eyeball yeah it's been my future eyeball a future eyeball lets me sorry sir my future eyeball lets me see subtitles you're jumping out of this guy's [ __ ] birth he's such an instill he doesn't care this guy doesn't fight you stand up for himself okay let's sit down you could have said the big joe what's the deal oh [ __ ] i think joe is kind of big joe loves that whatever he's he's got ears like that yellow guy from sin city that guy well you don't want to ruin the movie dude sure sure i'm sorry remove what i just i did spoil the movie please censor out what he said please censor out with the most horrifying uh noise you can think of look at that [ __ ] tattoo you spent money on that look at the flat ass on the back it's a yeah it's a girl like belting you that girl's ass what is going on with her it's like pointy it's like a witch in that image can't stop staring at it i don't care about what does this guy say he's gonna ask him to say it again i don't even know what he said already he's got a nova idea i think that's an expression in the cyberpunk future each page is an lcd screen doesn't make you wonder why they'd have pages at all that's like one of those things where it's like it's kind of a neat idea but it's like it's like it's like a jetson's idea it's wasteful yeah it's like well you would just you just give somebody a screen the lighting in this game is really cool though you got them at that whoa what the [ __ ] going on those little palm trees i'm looking at yeah that that's definitely busted that's like outside or something what are you doing palm trees in the middle just appearing oh that's what that is i thought that was like a that's a ghost the road is yours those look like trees somebody told me those lights aren't supposed to be because they're going with with it with the lights right oh yeah yeah i think it's i think it's there's some like weird render order problem can you ask him about the palm trees behind him i thought that was a g-string on that woman yeah and it's just a goofy fanny pack i thought it was like a horribly rigged g string hey i can't stop looking at those trees very distracting this is how you start off a game you have people sitting in a booth for 15 minutes i agree it's like savage greed says i and v can we go do something [ __ ] fun now yeah oh yes at least you can still do that whoa you can't walk through me oh my god she looked right into my soul that's [ __ ] scary get away from this person that's so but that's so realistic that a waitress would walk
