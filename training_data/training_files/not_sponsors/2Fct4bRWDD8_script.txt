it's time to disintegrate and no it's not Daniel snap type of disintegrating it's kind of more like a my internal organs are failing type of disintegrating but for today's video what we did is essentially make a scenario where every time you mine a block it could be wood stone diamond door sponge you will take 1% of damage that means if you break a hundred blocks you're dead and to make things even worse we've enabled Giga drill which is basically a scenario where every single tool like your pickaxe or trouble gets efficiency ten so not only you're taking damage when you break a block well you might accidentally break multiple blocks and that could be detrimental to your health and you'll see later in this video how difficult it is mine underground and to basically played the whole entire UHC in general so sit back relax get some snacks get some water Rab meat and watch this UHC unfold socials bring the buff you want that's pretty much it intro done hello hello hello how you doing how's your day I hope your day is doing well let's do this I see those canes right there imma go you like it and Zoop there you go oh oh I just realized what this was oh my gosh I just got set back to reality because it just reminded me what this scenario is okay okay okay well I guess we now know that when I break this wood it's gonna hurt yup it does and it does just a little bit but obviously health is percentile right it's all just a percentage so if I press /h they never do 97 percent I broke three blocks in total and yeah it just shows I mean at least I could punch mobs right they're not blocks I mean they look like plugs but they have wives I have hearts and organs internal organs yeah okay they're dead now Wow oh my gosh even the tall grass that I break counts as a block this sucks alright let's just do the things that we need to do stone tools time here we go boom boom boom I'm gonna look down oh I just realized efficiency X here we go I'm gonna mine down here there there one two - oh it's so fast I forgot yeah big good drill on dude there you go boom all right we got some steel tools alright I want to just minimize the amount of times I'm mine alright oh gosh yeah I just want to make sure that I only mine ores oh gosh I don't think having me mind some cobblestone is the best thing to do okay hello MA hi thank you that green boy all right I want to dig deeper into this cave you know what I think it's smart for us to get as much iron as possible because I would love to get an anvil but the thing is that it just hurts if it's 31 iron ingots to get one anvil that means I have to use up a 31% of my health which is so sad to think about but it's just the truth I have to go and get all the stuff but luckily there's a finally Hill so I'm just gonna make sure I use all lot of my health before it initiate s-- just get all they aren't as possible before final and if you don't know Bonner Hill starts in like the five minute mark so I have about ninety ish seconds for me to get all the iron I can OOP OOP OOP OOP OOP bing bang ball there you go get as much iron as physically possible everything counts yup as well as right here there ya go okay all right I'm gonna mine a little bit more down though this is really painful I hope I just want to go down like diamond level there you go boom boom boom I'm a Chuck left do we have we have thirty three blocks to mine oh my goodness okay oh I hear the lava you get two lava huh get closer get closer to lava yes okay we found like a lava cave thingy whoa all right nice how much do we have left okay 25 I have to break 24 blocks for me to drive and just get all the things that I need I get as much iron boom boom boom boom boom boom I love how I fire as bt-dubs get more mining hills gonna start get a little bit more there a little bit more yeah I have about a stack of iron okay that was super good yeah all right there you go I'm gonna also make one of these a full iron set of armor I think it's anvil time here we go bada-bing yeah there you go and there you go boom bucket because why not and you're good to go alright from then on we're just gonna have to worry about the health that we have because every time my mind is actually like my real health I have to take more seriously of okay we need to get some golden diamonds here real quick I hope this is gonna be a good day because if this is not a good cave then that means we're probably just gonna have to mine more to find the ores and that's so bad because you don't want that we do not want to go in mine we'll just lose so much health oh no I'm just gonna have to jump down I think that's the smartest thing to do if I could find something I'm gonna have to maximize all surface area of the caves that I get if not then I don't know what I'm gonna be doing honestly how can people pull off getting diamonds and gold in this game I really don't know what's it I just build my retirement home good choice honestly good choice no I never realized how bare-bones this game would be honestly I can't even find any gold or diamonds down here it's all orangey I can't even strip mine if I do then I'm gonna lose so much Shelton eventually kill myself and that's not okay I'm just gonna go back up to the surface what can I do I can't get any healing I can't get any diamonds oh my gosh this is such a bare-bones time right now all men at least I have a bow that I killed from a skeleton from earlier maybe that's the way to go perhaps that's possibly the way because if I go and kill a bunch of chickens out there and get their feathers right and I have a bunch of one of these gravel hoop and maybe I could just go and boast them and kill people that way because I feel like the people who do get enchantments are more likely to lose more health which means I could probably boast spam them to death right I hope this theory actually works if it doesn't then rip I'll try it out instead I'm gonna do this strategy where I'm gonna go up to surface farm a bunch of feathers and just fight people who have lower health using dominantly my bow in order for me to kill them is it usually when you fight people with a bow if they don't have a bow themselves then they're gonna be at a huge disadvantage all right we're done feathers that boy oh my gosh look at everybody's health right now dude look at it's no one's out a hundred percent there's people who are like out 1% 4% 19:17 oh my gosh a lot of people I'd say more than half of everybody is less than half health and I don't even know if it's personally worth it for them like is it I don't know we'll see you later in this game if it was truly worth it I shape I want you in order for me to get a rod dude having a rod will be SuperDuper nice as well here we go we got to string right there I made 47 arrows there boom and yeah that's pretty good I'll keep in mind that our bows only had 74 durability so that's the maximum amount of arrows that we could be using or not quite at the maximum but we still have a crap ton of arrows to probably kill somebody I'm trying to look at other people's health right now okay Benny's right here a man's only on 30% there's people all over just running around in full iron with like super low health and it's so sad to see I actually waited it out I hope this was all worth let's look at everybody's health real quick EVPs in 30 seconds by the way so just keep in mind that alright let's see this Oh oh man a lot of people's health is super low but at the same time I'm pretty sure there were some people that were lucky enough to get a lot of gold which allows them to get multiple healings so there actually is people out there that have better stuff than I do with all the healing and all that but still if there's just full irons that are just roaming around with like 60 health or something I could easily just bow spam them to death I just got to go and find those people instead here we go he's now enabled a lot of people are gonna start dying dying really quickly I'm assuming well yeah a lot of people are just starting to heal up you can see everyone's just gapping up oh gosh I remember centers are just going up oh gosh all right let's see if we could find anybody nearby I'm like God 300 ish blocks around zero zero I'm storming down there I'm pretty sure we're gonna find like some sort of person nearby very very soon especially considering that oh wow there's only 120 players left dude over 50 players I've died within the first 20 minutes of this UHC what oh there's a person right there hello hi mr. slim on 56 hi I'll just a person right there slim whoo hi i slim oh gosh I'm gonna try not to get hurt from this person oh there's a bone itself whoa get away no he's gone okay that's a scary person that is someone that I don't know if I could even fight there's Levi right here Oh 45 percent okay that's interesting oh they're gapping up it seems yeah they are they have something I hope they don't have any stock stuff dude I'm right there tune them again oh they don't have boots what even is this you have enchantment sir I get it I'm gonna shoot you oh oh they're down here oh we got them amazing all right let's get their stuff boom boom oh my gosh the plan kind of work yeah okay there you go boom what else do we have here what is that what sword is that I'm interested to know it's a sharp one very nice course they didn't have the boots but at least we have Ewing now pretty nice the strategy worked the snowball is amazing let's just get this I'm trying not to break a tall grass because if it does that I'm gonna lose a percentage and that sucks alright there you go we got an enchantment table whoa all right time for us to set up shop right here I think we deserve it yeah all right let's see what could do right now I think we could probably get a little bit more gravel some more Flint for us to get more arrows it might be a little painful but it's gonna be worth it okay we're good bing-bang Bowl all we have over a stack that's super nice it's gonna be even nicer once we get this enchantment on a power bow I'll go for prods one there you nice and protection there and you know what we could do brought to you there you go ooh it's harsh because I'm using a diamond pick everything breaks so quickly alrighty now we could go and make a jihad bada-bing yeah we're doing something we're doing big money moves all right we could progress now I think it's actually smart for me to find some sheep to like go and share because if I get enough string for another both and that means I can get power to find chat the other boat that I make and then combine the two power ones right if I had power to I could post them even harder that sounds super duper helpful you know what I'm gonna go and give haircuts all throughout this map we're all the sheep in the world looking at the kill board right now I'm not surprised there's a lot of people that have kills already I mean this mr. white you care has four tools already and then a lot of other people have like three and twos the good amount is that someone Skye basting right there I know I know hi all gosh there's Rahil right there what even is this what an interesting situation that guy is definitely eligible to become one of the top killers right there without a doubt aid there's a crafting table with a bunch of sheep around you know I think we could probably make the boss sooner than I expected here we go oh wow we already have it that was easy I'm gonna go and make was a rod boom place that and power one and of course power - all right noise break break alright we are good good power - is gonna appear so badly especially if there's any stock irons we're gonna be fighting just a few shots and they'd be dead there's only 65 players left this is such a fast game I never realized how much it would just pierce everyone's help oh wow it really demotivated a lot of people to go mining honestly I mean a lot less people have more gold more diamonds which means that since everyone's gonna be more closer to stock R and rather than like guide enchanted bull iron he get killed a lot faster a lot of people are dying very quickly man oh my goodness well there's a person right there hello Jason 63% aye we got someone to fight here Oh I think they're like a two or three shot they don't gap up that's gonna be very very nice hello all they went down I don't know if that's even worth it dude when you go and jump down in a cave that's so scary oh there's another person right here hello hi mr. stalk iron 45-percent OOP jewel God Oh No whoa okay you had two pearls what and healing very nice I'm gonna go take their head real quick do there you go okay we could be like oh gosh oh where these people come from nope I'm getting out see you later nope I'm just gonna go pearl away goodbye Oh successful evade I think it was worth the pearl because I could have just gone targeted there that would have been one bat mistake okay but life I guess in the meantime wall before fighting still I'm gonna go and make one of these another G head there you go oh there's the person right there hello SJ Williams oh we got a fight on our hands I don't know if they have a bow which is a very fortunate thing for us we could have a little good advantage here this guy's on that forty five percent they do have healing though so we're gonna have to bow them a little bit more if we're gonna actually kill them but unfortunately I don't know if I'm gonna be able to go and get some loot from them blue as in healing he says I'm not even good in mine if I do kill him then I'd be full diamond so that's gonna be amazing I don't know if I could pull that off though but if it's gonna be a thing then that's gonna be amazing alright I'm gonna go actually go for it I think that would be a smart move alright here we go oh here we go we did that oh yeah oh my god we're going up the ranks boys just from stock iron I didn't even get to in Santa's game well here we are oh yeah what do you have three full diamond oh we could be one of these boys yeah we're one in one in healing now oh my gosh this is so blessed right now alright let's go and break one of these boys crack the egg well the meat version of the egg oh you see plenty of people finding each other right now hey Joe I'm gonna run this way there's like people over there okay I'm not gonna fight that just yet looking at the kill board yep we are up on the Katie very very nice yeah we're climbing up slowly but surely I believe we could get up pretty high it's gonna do us pretty well all right I think it's time for us to get a little bit more Flint Oh ow ow ow ow okay worth we're gonna get our feathers from that yup we did as painful as it is I think it's completely worth all of that time because I think the bows gonna be our strong suit it really would be oh there's a person right here hello all 56% 48 got a pearl oh they're gone I'm gonna try to chase them I'm on my way I think they're completely gone Oh what are you hello we got a person here I'm not rushing but I'm rushing he's on 62% while I'm at 47 but I definitely have the healing so maybe just go kill him here we go get some shots there you go there's one 39 percent now he's a two-hit possibly if I shoot him again hello oh he wants to initiate a fight here oh oh oh this is so gross what I'm doing but it's SuperDuper effective I had them all right I'll go ahead hello yeah I have stuff now ooh oh that's a rip for them huh oh okay a little sloppy at the end but still got it how much stuff that he had he didn't have much yeah all of his gaps yet uh we could give me another gap or another head at least hey I think that's gonna be pretty useful you had the gold to match not bad not bad oh who are you hello who's that sham okay I'm glad identified 64% oh I didn't even make the jihad yet aw crap I'll have to do some crazy maneuver I do have a ender pearl though oh gosh okay I'm gonna make one of these real quick boom before it's too late I'm gonna go and make that G head right now oh oh oh oh I'm gonna have to G head right now here we go hello go oh I'm gonna just go and make one of these whoo you better back out buddy was he at right now he's on 85% but I am too I don't have any more healing but he doesn't know that I don't know if it's worked for me to go I think I should just leave oh gosh I have to go and do a thing where I have to drop somebody that has health because I think he has health but he has like probably the same amount of armor that I do gosh well at least we made it a top 25 though I don't know if there's any other person out there that has a lot of healing but is easy to drop I just probably have to combo or do some crazy thing man okay okay okay think Harvey think what can you do all right how about this I'm gonna try to get a power through area I'm gonna go both spam somebody hit them low and I'm gonna use the Pearl hoe just pearl up to them and kill them drop them if they're healing and then snowball from there all right but I have to pull it off all perfectly the all that execution has to be near perfect the perfect I have to pull it off really well it has to be a good execution I think we're gonna have to find a bunch of sheep first we have to get that power three I believe we could get it oh gosh meat if it's gonna be closing in soon I really hope that I won't be finding somebody before meetup I only have 90 seconds to pull this off I'm pretty sure come on give me more sheep not the ones that are already shaved look at them there's another person right there who's that what is their name and to Anesti who is I I'm gonna just shoot them to know is it yes oh it's yes all Genet persons has Vick over there Oh people people are around yeah I'm going this way now goodbye goodbye goodbye okay this power three stress is not working cause everything is a cow why is there so many cows here what is this orangey oh oh top 20 there are 17 players left okay it's gonna happen here we go it's time meet up his name there's so many people around I just need two more rolled up or me die get the thing there's a sheep right there alright hano hano hano hano hold on okay do the thing yes - wolf okay cool and then do this three string make a crafting bench boom bow right here oh it's getting a little tough right now where's my enchantment table there it is enchant and then do one of these boom and then do one of these power tree oh I wish I could make more errors but I don't have any more all right I should probably leave this is that is that a famous last words okay home I'll just take the anvil alright that's only 1% down but I'll take that because I feel like that's really important a little bit more important it's considering that I already have both of the anvil and the enchantment table anyway there's no point all right no worries right we got to find somebody to kill there's only 12 players left okay the sham right there he's on 63 okay I'm gonna go fight you then hello sham I have a powered three bow if you want % ow please spare me I have no heal same oh no no no he's getting cleaned No I wanted a water getaway Oh where's he's gone okay there's my chance the killings one more person is gone all right I'm gonna have to just kill you somehow all right all right sir well you better run you better run don't 65% how much more healing do you want to lose huh oh I don't think he has a bow okay we could shoot a little bit more here yeah it's possible all right here's the plan I get to maybe like 40% on him and then when I do that all Pearl okay but if I could actually pull him off a 40% I know if I could pull it off the possibility but I mean I don't know how much healing this guy has you could probably have all the healing in the world I'm just wasting arrows and time and my life is actually uninterested I'm gonna go and run a raw oh my gosh there's only ten players left we've made it to top ten that I'm pretty happy about that honestly I love how there's someone out there that has like zero health like one shot for anything I could honestly just throw water at them and they'll just die I need to find this person your boy is just hovering over at 69% that's all I got is need to a more gold I don't know if there's any gold anywhere probably not so I mean it wouldn't make sense if there's any gold just sitting around for no reason right I wish I didn't drop my Flint from earlier because if I kept it then I could have made more arrows oh there's Hannah right there goodbye oh it's getting even more tough who is that person Bob orders gonna be closing dude it's gonna go to a hundred one hundred I'm gonna see a bunch of people that I know might try to kill me all right here we go here we go here we go good luck me oh boy seven players left where can I go where can I go oh gosh there's the janitor right here hello hi hi I'm gonna just run this way ow oh oh that's gonna hurt yeah that was a big mistake on my part what am i at 45% oh geez I'm gonna mine here ow okay 40% we're hearts left all they have gaps dude I'm just gonna pearl save me some time Oh baby oh gosh I bet I could survive I bet I could survive loser oh I believe come on 37 percent I'm gonna run this way yeah oh they're so high and health again what happened I miss the days when you're at 37 oh I have no more arrows oh gosh oh no oh this is kryptonite all right we got to do some stupid thing oh ow I'm gonna just take the arrows on the floor and shoot you with them ow oh gosh this is it is my faith Oh bata ah well hi minute is top five okay oh my gosh that was a wild ride oh my goodness we get to see you know the top four players go fight as I bet I'm interested to see here comes a rapid succession of kills oh boy yeah narrator had like four cats Oh honestly I think everyone just had more gap in general yep there's seven gaps right there from yes rawhide three and audacity was just afk and was never in the game to begin wait okay let's see how this one goes I think they're organizing fights actually oh here we go and these lads are off oh gosh this is getting kind of rough honestly Paul Janish also getting the trades would handle right now I think had I just finished your healing yup yeah they're still dies he gets the kill with no healing right there Raoul and yes our finish up the fight yes wins and now it's just Hana and yes for the final 1v1 whoa I now realize how much of an insane fight that was I mean yes and Rahil both had 10 kills each double digits and that was a really serious fight oh gosh they both had a lot of kills to the name okay here we go looking out the helped right now it seems that I think just only has a G ahead but Hannah right here has two gaps this is kind of close honestly this seems like he wants to go start the fight would somebo but now and is going in with the trade I think she's the one with the shark three oh gosh it's getting close but Hannah backs out with 17 health oh she gets the gap up alright here we go they're showing up a bow fight right now yes does it have any more healing but goes for the pot shots right there the jump shots Hannah's gonna go eat her other thing of healing the final thing don't have any more healing but yes still wins oh my gosh that was insane I didn't even know who would actually win right there because everyone had like around the same healing but yes those two managed to win yeah that's the game I was pretty fun interesting concept I enjoyed it I'm super glad that I took the move then I actually go and find an enchant table or diamonds or gold before PvP that was a very nice move for me but yeah anyways if you want to play some wacky you H C's
