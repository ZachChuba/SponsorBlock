make your next move with Squarespace guys four years on this channel you have asked our sara and i dating and we've been silent on this topic okay well isn't we have been but I think that we're finally ready to tell the world if we're dating or not so the answer is no we're not we're not dating now um we're any case okay oh yes guys that's right last week I asked Sara if she would marry me and she she said yes thank you by the way that was really nice thank you I appreciate that but err do you have anything that you want to say Ashley I need to go work on the guest list okay these guys this kind of makes me an expert on the whole proposal thing because I'm one for one so if you are with someone and you're thinking that maybe you always want to be with that someone I wanted to offer you some advice on how to propose to your girlfriend first things first location the location of the proposal has to be perfect you can't get down on one knee just anywhere location is like 70% of what makes a good proposal work where are we we got my favorite fast-food restaurant I was eating a bean burrito right over there alone after work one day when I decided you were the prettiest babe I had ever laid eyes on and then it was in that bathroom right over there when I texted you for the first time and yes you if you wouldn't go out on a date with me anyway um I requested for you real quick ask yourself where did we meet where did we have our first date where is her favorite spot in the world pick a place with some sentimental value but make it someplace that it isn't gonna be too obvious oh oh you know what I was thinking we should drive up to the pants that we first met each other right you know just just to see what's going on up there but it's not like a five-hour drive yeah but but maybe there's maybe maybe there's something fun gonna happen out there you know like I think you might be pleasantly surprised you know okay so you got the perfect spot right great now we need to talk about you see you're about to ask a lie changing question through this girl and obviously you're going to be nervous the problem is if you look nervousness she's gonna know something's up are you okay yeah I'm fine are you okay are you sure you it's very hot in here I feel very hot and I'm out of water guys would just take a deep breath stay calm everything is gonna be okay look she's gonna say yes okay so what are you nervous about and if you're nervous because you're not sure if she's gonna say yes then you probably shouldn't be proposing just yet just just wait a couple more months maybe Daryl will you marry me no can I stop recording now look when it comes to executing this proposal I have one simple rule the simpler the better you don't need this to be like an elaborate plan okay and there are two main reasons number one the more variables you introduce into this perfect moment the more freaked out you're going to be the whole time and the second is okay look I'm not a woman but I've seen enough of those proposal videos on YouTube was to deduce one thing most women are really uncomfortable with big elaborate proposals I'm serious go look up some proposal videos on YouTube so girl getting proposed to always cut it looks uncomfortable the entire time it's like she's excited but there's always this look in her eye like isn't it what's over good lover with and then there's gonna be a 10-minute musical followed by five minutes of interpretive dance and then after that just wow are you sure she's going to like that seems kind of excessive Josh - Josh proposal speak louder than words remember that okay plus I'm going to pay for the honeymoon with the Adsense money and I'm going to be no submit the story to the local news as well oh that's really good marketing Thanks the biggest reason why you should keep it simple though is because of something that anyone who has ever proposed before myself included can tell you and I'm just going to be real right now with you guys okay keep this on the DL as soon as you get down on one knee whatever poetic words you plan to say they're gone they're out the don't bye-bye if you can even get will you marry me out of your mouth when yo in that situation consider it a triumph just plan on keeping the speech short okay because it's going to be regardless zero oh okay so I had the whole thing I was going to say plans very romantic I swear just one second Oh Tara I don't really know what's going on right here but I just I just really want to let you know that I wanted to finally resolve this messy Monday storyline will you marry me yes just giving you a stay tuned for a scene from right now at squarespace.com slash calc next week on messy mondays think I did realize this he's wasted the last five years of his life I thought he loved me I thought he cared about me I thought you was the one what did Jordan have it I don't have a youtube channel big deal I have one of those do you know millions of dubs whatever happened to that gent [Music]
