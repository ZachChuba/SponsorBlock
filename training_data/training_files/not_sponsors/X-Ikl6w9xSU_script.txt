hi I'm an electret and this is my good buddy Eric who came from Philadelphia say hi Eric I guess to build this sculpted table that he designed for the tiny house super fun project before we this video and this channel let's get after it let's do it okay so we have a very different color all right bye we have a very different color sawdust going on the show right now than we have before due to the fact that we're using foam insulation now there's a huge benefit to this for me because I'm just like sick I can't very well interpret what's on a shirt paper into a design and so can you tell me a little bit about this process yeah so this is a process that I really like to use in anything that I'm doing a sculptural Foreman hmm so you can see that I do jot down my ideas on paper but I'm not the world's greatest drawer so it gets most of the information down but there's no way for me in my head to really see exactly what that's gonna look like in three dimensions so I take that and I transfer it to a piece of foam insulation the reason I use this stuff is because it's inexpensive and it carves super super quickly and I jot down just kind of rough lines on here with a marker and carve to them and then I can feather it in with rasps and bios to kind of give it the final shape I want okay so now I get to cut chime in on the design things because I love using wood coloration to my benefit so this is a leftover piece from my good whisper writing best segment if you haven't seen that video check it out so we can kind of shift this according to the grain of the wood has the greatest amount of structural integrity from a piece of wood absolutely perfect [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] but you have a long line through marks you can actually make yourself a little marking guide by using the pinkies of both hands and just making yourself a little guide here when you need to do multiple layouts you can use sliding rulers and set it to the depth that you are going to use and then you can just pick up and make easy choice measurements from this one set for the halfway point this one set for our taper and your workbench is always your third hand when you don't have one so here I'm using the dog do you balance the ruler I'm going to get it set where I need it and then that's holding it in place so that I can kind of use every available asset here without having the rulers [Music] [Music] so now these have been roughed out with the power carbines yeah it is not time to refine and shine absolutely the next teacher taught me that in yet so we're gonna plump it up here in the you know that clamp goes this way we're gonna clamp it up here and be it foam which will give it a nice work holding ability for that crushing this size [Applause] [Music] take note about how the grain follows the curve of the wood even though it's a cut and not bent piece this is going to be substantially stronger and that's why we quote-unquote wasted so much wood cutting these out [Music] [Music] okay so right up the tableside these things you know fit nicely right probably the easiest thing to like adjust the fit here would be to plan it correct clean the top that is to you know make it small obviously you can't add material so hopefully didn't cut that too big to start with but now that next step is just gonna be to flatten these out so that they sit flush exactly so we've got a round top going into a flat mortise so our 2 options would either be to round the inside of that data yeah or to flatten the outside of the table and the ladder is the easier option by far so what I'm gonna do is come in here with the chisel and just flatten this out and then clean it up with a router plenty and those are going to be dead flat and beautiful and then we're gonna come to the tabletop we're just gonna put a small flat where each of the legs are gonna go so we have full blue contact there perfect cool alright so then the next step would just be to make this lower shelf exactly so as soon as these are cleaned up and cut out then we're gonna make this lower shelf have another shallow dado right here we're gonna glue the bloody thing together perfect [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] now they just need to orient this bottom shelf that it has the seam in the exact same spot absolutely laughs just making sure that these are right where they need to be okay so if we mark the mortises we could actually do this the same as you do with a biscuit joint and literally just do one of these the hole is gonna be slightly oversized anyway because you want the epoxy to be able to grab onto something so doing that's a great idea and then we'll just clean up these two on the outside [Music] [Music] so thank you so much for taking the time to tune in to us this video and I hope you leaves feeling challenged and inspired to do things with your hands as well make sure you go over and follow Eric at ian curtis on instagram as i woodshop be sure you click that below thanks so much for supporting me Cheers you may recognize where we are we are in the tiny house and we are going to be making good there you are we're gonna be making a custom table for the tiny house we have threaded rod pink foam epoxy a couple of sanding discs for the angle grinder alright guys so we're all the way back from Home Depot and driving and this friggin piece of foam insulation is just squealing the entire way I don't even know what to do or that get the greatest amount of structural and tigers good safety first you
