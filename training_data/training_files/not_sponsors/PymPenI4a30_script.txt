hi my name is Sarah I'm a filmmaker and today I'm going to be reacting to hit by mamamoo I don't know what order I'll upload this in but I just filmed not by the moon by got7 and if you watch that already you may know that I've had four and a half hours of sleep and I'm tired as and I didn't say anything useful in that video whatsoever so I'm hoping this video I'll say something more useful maybe not though sorry I love my mama I say I love my mum literally I know two songs why do I say I love my mama because I love those two songs but I don't know I like my mom ooh a lot I haven't heard too many songs I've heard starry night I've heard gobo baby maybe more but I can't remember their names I know the members names moon Byul is my favorite forever whassa is also amazing they're all amazing I've heard the chorus of this song I think I know it's that it goes like hip hip when I did it right I don't know we'll see before I get into this reactions every Tuesday and Friday I have to think about it let's just watch this [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] this sounds good it's not like like I expected [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] why are you like this [Music] shoot gloves in her hair [Music] there's so much going on how many rap breaks are you having [Music] making money [Music] oh cool [Music] first universe second third fourth oh well thank you for explaining the music video to me I appreciate that I love that song so good I did not read the lyrics I can't I don't know I shouldn't I shouldn't put the lyrics on the first time and watch it because I can't read them it's something else with movies because usually movies are a little slower paced so like it's a close-up on someone you could read the lyrics it alerts you could read the subtitles and then go back up to their face but here it's like if you go down to read the lyrics like five different scenes have happened already let me read the lyrics really quick no real has like three rap breaks in this I'm not gonna go through the whole video again just for the lyrics as far as I can tell from that half I think it's about the media like them saying we are awesome and we know it basically like this is the female modern less stupid version of I'm sexy and I know it I think yay it's editing Sarah again I was really struggling to convey my thoughts here I was not trying to say the song is about the media I was trying to say this song is about them being celebrities and dealing with the media or dealing with fans also plus a little sight note about this video my thoughts were all over the place for the rest of this video so I decided to divide all my comments into sections a section about their styling a section about my filmmaking commentary and stuff like that so it's a little more clear what I'm talking about and I'm not just jumping from one sentence into a completely different thing but yes so enjoy this second half of the video so this is all you alternative universes right so first universe let me see first universe they're all famous and in this box that says all of these things second universe ah solar so liza princess wayne is the pro caster mundial is like a director I think because she has the director thing and yells through it and then she's on set why as a mom is this like alternate universes of what they could have become if they didn't become famous third universe solar as a pop star oh I see so there's a pop star Wayne is chillin in the desert with her trailer moonbyul I know I I feel like I've never I didn't see this one what she does in this universe what's as president I can get behind that and then fourth solar is a boxer I [Applause] [Music] didn't see what Wayne doesn't this one movie ol is a dancer I think they're dancing aren't they and why is like a performer does this tie together with any storyline so they have like like story lines that go through their videos I'm not sure about that tell me in the comments if they have overlapping story lines through their music videos maybe this is one maybe they already filmed the other universes or having them having different universes it's like a thing I'm not sure maybe it's just for this video oh this is the one with the suit what is she she's a painter then she's a painter maybe this correlates to personal interests that they have which would be very cool if the video like showed interests that they have like no mule would like to direct she's like she likes to paint she-she's does stuff for the environment like she protests or like she advocates for the environment she's a dancer well she's a she a choreographer she is I mean she likes singing she likes being a princess I mean I'm not sure well that one she likes boxing I mean maybe that would be very cool if they did that like in the universe like a different universes they follow their interests like what what is this Wayne doing she just likes to travel the world maybe [Music] [Applause] yeah we love you all no you're awesome like stop just look so cool oh my god bill looks amazing I I can't with her she's like oh sorry is she gay openly in the wheel if you're gay hit me out honestly oh my god we'll stop it she's so cool okay that's my bottom you'll put a joke I can never do that I mean there's not really much technical stuff to say about the video there's no like as far as I can tell there's no green-screen going on I feel like this is all shot on location which is awesome I love videos that are all completely on location I mean it's very this this shot specifically is very stage II like you can tell us they still this on a sound stage because the like the set dressing it's so not realistic but who cares no one I mean you should care because if you're here then you want to hear about this right otherwise I don't have to try so hard to find something technical to say president wasa dressed ridiculous at the airport yeah so it is about the media I love that close up close so it's so cool this song whole song is so good the thing with this song is well the thematic of the song allows for cameras and lights to be in the frame because it's about the media so it's like if even if by mistake that was a camera in the frame or something like I'm saying this because you can see the lights here so usually it depends on obviously the style and the like what is shown in the video but typically you probably wouldn't want the lights to be sitting like you wouldn't want it to look so obviously like a setup like a stage but since it's about the media it's like it makes sense if you see the behind the scenes because that's what they're talking about kind of the flash lights from the paparazzi alright I forgot I forgot that way in place the drums also those match cuts are very nicely done the lighting in that John is beautiful in Lucy this like the reflection in her eyes done here gorgeous you can see that it's they're holding a white white board it's that what you call it I forgot already like a reflector do I have something like that basically like a like a cardboard like a white cardboard or a white styrofoam board they've just hold it there so the light reflects but it actually gives her like this reflection in her eyes which is super pretty like the lighting and this is beautiful all this one too obviously lighting is gorgeous like the spotlight on her it's very nice the lighting in here is super pretty like the pink and purple in the back super nice yeah again I don't really have a lot of technical stuff to say because there's not too much technical things going on it's basically just sets camera lights action huh let me know in the comments if there was anything or if there is anything about this video that you want me to take a look at I'll tell you in the comments because I don't know I can't really see any anything that would be worth explaining it's just very everything's very practical which is cool [Music] there's so much going on in this video this set is cool it looks awesome love their styling her eyebrows are pink and her hair is blue who would Wayne could pull that off honestly didn't they didn't wash out her lab with a boy group I saw a picture it kind of reminds me of that picture what she's wearing and the set to later on and love this song is so cool I'm so glad I finally listened to it cuz now I could put it in my playlist um though this right this this set up and I think I don't remember what she's wearing but I feel like this is exactly where they took the picture for the collab with her and the boy group I don't remember which group it is look at all the different outfits they're wearing it's crazy I love the Wardrobe and like the styling choices in this video they all look so good she looks a little she reminds me a little bit of Johanna in this one I don't know why is she wearing gloves in her hair I've never say hello cannot look cool how can that look good I hope I said interesting things again there wasn't too much to talk about in this video it just looks it looks really cool everything's very practical styling is awesome song is super cool choreography is amazing I love Moo mule I think that's all I have to say thank you for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned something or maybe you saw something that you didn't before leave me in the comments
