these are the heart of your system hi and welcome to a new video as you can see we're in my living room and we're taking a closer look at my htpc which is sitting nicely inside my ikea shelf and this one is from 2014 it's AMD khibiny base which is a m1 it's far from any enthusiast platform but back then was extremely cheap and also extremely efficient I think I paid about 40 euro for the motherboard 4 year for the CPU and it's one memory stick and I think the total thing was just about 100 euro total so yeah totally worth it but now in 2019 yeah there is just no performance anymore if I want to run YouTube 4k videos or even if it's 1080p and I'm running 50 or 60 fps this thing is really on the limit that's why I have to update this I have an Rison 330 200 G here which is pretty much the same as a 2200 G as far as I know but yeah if I'm already buying a new CPU why would I buy the 2200 G that's why I picked a 3200 G so we will do an upgrade to my am-1 Kabini system and before we get to that we will just take a look at the performance of my Kabini system as you can see I'm still running Windows 8 on this system which is something I definitely will change for the future we will upgrade to Windows 10 you can see in CPU Z 250 350 AMD Athlon with 25 watt TDP 28 nanometer technology this belongs to the Jaguar family and right click shows that the CPU is running four cores at just above two gigahertz mainboard is an Asus am one I a and if you take a look at the memory you can see I'm only using a single stick with four gigabytes ddr3 even and this is only running at 666 so 1333 mega on the memory we will just perform a singer bench or 15 run I think I never tried this before on this EP you not entirely sure how long it will take but I think it will really take a little bit this is really not the fastest CPU it's an APU so the graphics unit is included which you can see it's an AMD Radeon HD 8400 yeah and this will certainly take a bit sorry I just had a pizza break because this really like really took forever you can see our 15 singer is only 44 points multi is 149 49 points considering that latest rise in 3000 has a single single bench score of about 210 like one Reisen 3,600 core is faster than all of those four combines this shows why this CPU really needs to be replaced yeah let's let's open this thing place the PC on my desk for now I can't really tell you what kind of case this is I just remember that I pretty much bought the cheapest case with this kind of form factor or size I could find back then because I just wanted it to match my IKEA shelf and yeah I think it was pretty cheap like 30 euro but not entirely sure and really cannot remember the brand it's very easy to open it though just have to remove four screws on top then can remove the top plate a quick disclaimer before we were opening this case I just assembled this case like for the system five years ago and it never opened it afterwards again I also never cleaned it afterwards again which I probably should have done but yeah [Music] [Applause] yeah I think I have to get the vacuum and remove some of this dust but maybe we move to PSU first [Music] removing the dims first those are masking Silverline dims Marcin was a memory brand that was really popular in like dr2 times kind of yeah left the market I think with ddr3 there are some sticks still available I think they even had an office in Germany I'm not even sure if they were from Germany but yeah muskan is not really present anymore but back then they were really really cheap and that's why I used them in this Rick now we will just remove the fan just out of curiosity because I never cleaned it and I think it will look absolutely terrible underneath honestly this is embarrassing I really don't like to show this but I want to show you the truth this is how it looks like if you don't clean your Rick for like five years and I'm pretty sure that the cooling did not benefit from this I always tell people to remove dust filters and clean your system regularly that's also what I do on my personal Rick like the gaming Rick I really clean it like every three months at least to make sure the cooling is sufficient and everything but on this yeah I'm not proud of it but this is how it looks like if you're not cleaning your Rick so clean your eggs I told you in the beginning of the video that I'm going to use rising 3 3200 G which is pretty much the same as the at least as far as I know as 2200 G the previous CPU and the previous one was also not soldered not unlike like 3630 700 X all of those are soldered and this one I think should use conventional Tim over and over again we actually will use still a dime 8 in combination with this additional AMD tool which I developed like a year ago I think it was it's nothing else than just a small piece of plastic and the longer screw putting the CPU inside today died mate but with the pins facing upwards so we're pushing against the PCB not like with the Intel CPUs very pushing against the HS put a small plastic piece in here slider from the back carefully insert the screw because you're if you're not careful you can theoretically bend some pins so it looks like and then it's just the usual process with force [Music] okay after I think pushing the IHS over the CPU I think like six seven eight times I thought this really feels like it's soldered and then I use Google which I should have done in advance and then turns out that somebody else deleted the CPU already in April before rice and three thousand came out and I just missed this news I didn't read it that's how you have to learn the hard way I think we still have to delete it right now because I already moved it so many times over the heat better or heats better over the PCB there is no way back [Music] you open to CPU and a thought aim this worked and maybe I can use this method in future for rising three thousand to delete the assaulter CPUs unfortunately you can see there is a small ax cap up here and you can see yeah this one is just moving around this cap was original on this side you can see all the other caps are protected with some kind of glue above it and the row of caps on the side here was not protected so yeah you can see this one is also loose and kind of forget about that one as well this one is also damaged that one looks fine so I think they're like four caps missing but this happened to me in the past as well with different CPUs and they were all working afterwards after I removed those caps yeah I hope I hope the CPU still works we'll see [Music] [Music] [Music] let's get to the assembly last night before I went to bed I quickly performed the test under 30 200g simply put it in an x5 70 board checked if it was booting into Windows if the temperatures were fine everything looked good so we can be sure that the CPU is still working even though there are some caps missing but as I said before on those CPUs if some caps are missing happened to me before they always worked so that's not really an issue I will use this asteroid p450 fatality gaming a/c ITX motherboard which is a board I purchased myself actually all the components on the table are purchased by myself nothing in here is sponsored that's kind of important to me because this is really the component selection I am doing personally yeah also under the aspects that I'm looking for the best like price performance ratio I was looking for an IT export that offers built-in Wi-Fi that was kind of important to me also HDMI and DisplayPort was important and this board offered both while it was fairly cheap I think I bought about I spent about 85 0 for this board new and originally packed on eBay so I think there was a quite good deal as I said before we will use the 3200 G on their CPUs testers and good CPU will be cooled by this ROG intact cooler I didn't really look for something fancy or even like an octorok holder I think it's not necessary for this operation I will use this on pretty much the minimum rpm if possible and if also if possible I will also undervolt the CPU to make sure that the power consumption is as low as possible because this rig will really run 24/7 like the previous one was also running 24/7 pretty much for five years and if you're just using this for like YouTube and Netflix I don't think it really matters if the CPU is running it like 50 degree or 60 degree as long as it's silent and you don't hear anything that's why I'm going to lock the RPM at the lowest possible level then I have two sticks of eight gigabyte course a vengeance lpx nothing with RGB because you're not going to see it anyway in this rig it's with 26 66 megahertz speed wouldn't really buy or recommend anything below that because that's typically not worth the money but for like an HTP see you don't need for like 3600 or something it doesn't really make much sense that's why 2666 is probably the best price spot for an HTP see all right let's get to it [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm not going to do something you really should not do at home like really really don't repeat this I'm just going to reuse might be quiet PSU yeah it should still work so I don't see why I should throw it away or replace it for now I only need 24 pin and the 8 pin EPS the cable everything else I don't need like SATA and PCI Express and molex and all of those I don't need and this is not a modular PSU that's why I will open the PSU and remove the cables unsold ur the cables which I don't need and there's really a high risk if you're doing that because they're capacitors inside they are charged with 230 volt if you touch those or some of those pins in theory you can kill yourself so really don't open PSU if you're not trained for this I am so I can do that but really don't repeat it at home [Music] first try to solder it with my small soldiering iron well small but it's still 60 what I think but this one is 150 what the same I used for the e power modules which is required because the PCB is thick and the copper layer as well and there's a ton of tin on there that's why we'll use this solar in arid pease you only has the EPS and 24-pin connector left that's all we need now we're going to add those two connectors then put in the PSU you can see cable management is much better than before I hid all the cables underneath the main board itself use a bit of cable ties on the side to make it nice and clean now at the PSU and we're done [Music] just finished setting up the system you can see I already performed in a better 15 runs with single and multi multi 464 points and singer 147 points that's pretty much tripled the performance and what I had with the AMD Kabini CPU and for me that was definitely worth the upgrade spending about I think overall 250 euro for this HTPC I think that's totally worth it obviously I could keep the old case tall PSU so I could save some costs on that I also thought about under vaulting in this CPU but then if you just take a look at power consumption right now in idle it's a rout yeah 2 to 3 watt for the CPU cores and then we have about 9 watt for the SOC so total something between 10 and 12 Watts seems to be in line from what I can measure from the socket so typical power consumption of this system is about 1516 what in idle which i think is fine for an HT PC and yeah if I need the power it's there the CPU can consume as you can see here up to 77 watt which still is fine considering what kind of performance you can get out of this chip and using the Russian tech cooler at 20% fan speed and always locked at 20% fans but even if the CPU is getting hot I limited to maximum 20% fan speed because you just don't want to sit on your couch enjoy a movie and then suddenly the fan spinning up Aria knowing that's why it's limited but you can see Cinebench max temperature if you load all four course 100% 75.8 degree Celsius that's still totally fine considering that in all daily applications watching YouTube videos Netflix and all of that I will never encounter this load that's why I'm pretty much happy with this system and yeah by the way if you were missing Coke Zero in my video I just tried coke clear and I'm not really a fan seems to be something like Coke Zero with zero calories and no I don't know no color in it but it really doesn't taste nice yeah I I don't agree Coke Zero for the win cochlear No alright so thanks for joining in in this video and see you next time [Music] [Music]
