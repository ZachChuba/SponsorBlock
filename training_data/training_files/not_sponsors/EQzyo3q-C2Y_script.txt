You are currently watching an online video,
which means your screen is shooting photons at your face in a pattern determined by pieces
of data that have traveled around the world as electrical impulses. The motions of these electrons and photons
are undeniable physical actions with real energy costs that even energy-conscious video-makers
can’t avoid: by the end of this video, you will have used the equivalent of about two
double-A batteries. Some of that energy is used by your device
itself. Laptops consume around one double-A battery’s
worth of energy every five minutes; mobile phones and tablets use one every half hour
or so. That’s a lot of juice, but it’s only a
portion of the total energy used to watch an online video. The rest comes from delivering the data to
your screen. Every pixel of every frame starts off as a
string of 0’s and 1’s stored somewhere on a distant server until called for, at which
point those 0’s and 1’s are transferred via local metro networks, high capacity long-haul
networks, undersea cables, more local networks, local access points, and your own internet
router, all before reaching your screen. Estimates for the total energy used on this
journey are hard to make, but various analyses suggest that a double-A battery’s worth
of energy will get you around ten megabytes of data. A three-minute live-action video is around
30 megabytes, so it drains 3 double-A’s to stream or download. MinuteEarth actually has it better, because
stick figures are awesome conservers of energy: videos with simple visuals can be stored as
smaller files and transferred much more efficiently, so our videos only drain about 2 batteries. Add in the energy your device uses to display
the video, and the grand total is somewhere between two and two and a half batteries per
view. But MinuteEarth videos can get upwards of
five hundred thousand views – collectively, the same as draining over a million double-A
batteries, or as much electricity as an average American household uses in three months. Which is a lot for one video. Don’t even ask how many households’ worth
of energy have been used watching Gangnam Style. The numbers in this video are based on averages
for the energy consumption of various devices and servers and on the average data sizes
and bitrates of online videos. Actual energy use may vary.
