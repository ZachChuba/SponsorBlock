background and to that I answer your parents don't love you and I've hacked my way here because paws Maz talked a lot and ramble all the time so huge Ahmad I hear us what's with you wearing this swanky look at hoodie and this mug and that's because I've got some new merchandise over at my crab made this little design right here blends in with the shirt color and looks fashionable you can actually wear in public so check it out look in the description below for it and I'm proud to announce that no VPN so go check out the description for the link below well I wanted to make this little video called your opinion my answers or youma for short short for yo mama this is where take your hot opinions that is maybe a little controversial when I'll basically answer them right now some of you might be like we all wait a second laws why don't you just call it my answer is your opinion so you can be like mayo for short and to that I answer your dollar and to kick-start this I made one tweet asking for those opinions and I got way more than I thought I would so the first response is when you ask a community for ideas cuz you low-key don't have any so the next response all right so although I got it for keep some tweets and stuff one person I made of mine actually by the name of Nate is lame provided dark points in which a lot of the other responses fit into so I'm gonna use his one as kind of like a guideline and then I'll give my responses to each them sequentially just a bit of context for those who don't know me hi my name is then I've been involved with the community for about two years now I've witnessed the things that's been happening outside the community as well as inside the community so that's what I think I could provide an interesting different perspective to all of your questions even mind though that whilst I have some knowledge about what's been happening in this community everything that I state is opinion and should not be taken as 100% back so Nate said the genre is going stale the genre is going stake and my answer to that is yeah it is if you look at within the animation community I don't think you'll find many people who say nah we are perfect leave us the way it is you peasants get away from me now of course a lot of people will I think agree that it's not as unique as it once was and then we get into the next question which is why why is that why is that the case so let me give you a quick history lesson okay so first and foremost it was Suzie and Dom expand they used to make these animated short stories they were really successful they did a good job good on here guys now then comes along James and Jaden okay James just having a success in his comics Jaden having worked for is cupcake decide they want to make animated stories as well James and Jaden then take the format establish my dominance woozi and then spin it to give their own style so why am i bringing this up well just to reiterate a little bit James and Jane and Sola was working and applied their own spin to it to make new content however in doing so along with the animation squad they popularized this genre so what ended up happening was that people tried to emulate exactly the style that they were doing instead of making it their own now that's not a bad thing when you're starting off that's fine and that's also not to everybody because you've got you know Tazz Rebecca para memory cheat just to name a few who I mess is successful and started off with their own very distinct style but also and I say there's an objective sense tim-tom and something else whitey did start off very similar to the odd ones out style not a negative thing because they've obviously got their own style now but they did the same formula and screaming instead of experimenting with the videos causing people to find the content state which leads on to the next point that Nate made which was I want soy times about drugs and pg-13-rated stuffed and he's not the only one who thought about this a lot of people actually had this concern I want more mature storytime animators now this is linking back to the prophets vs. desire that I mentioned before now the fact of the matter is this entire genre is taking advantage of the change of YouTube and unfortunately with the algorithm today we can't be as mature as we want we can push the line I push I definitely push lines but unfortunately if we talk about sensitive topics or put cuss words or put nono words on our titles we would get spanked by the yellow badge of D monetization on our dummy big cheeks sometimes what we want it happened about what we actually mean because at this current state YouTube is a full-time job for certain people and it's legitimately what puts food on their table would you really blame them as they follow the rules laid out by YouTube to maximize their income and this leads on to the next thing of desire because we want to push the boundaries I don't think any animator is sitting down and saying no of course not no one thinks that so there are examples of mature content channels like Bruce do Salmonella and young dawn and like you can do that and that's fine but it also traces back to just what is required animation is already a once a month thing and so working on this for weeks and then having a cut of our income it's just like why would you do that you know what I mean not to mention the people who want to remain family-friendly as a role model to their audience and there's nothing wrong with that but on the flip side older audiences also have the right to be like listen baby content break it's a big boy stuff man oh yeah so I'm going to tackle two of Nate's points here which is animators including myself need to work on making our voiceovers more sonically interesting and not so monotone and there's too much focus on artwork and not enough on the storytelling aspect and to that I agree this is one of the big big things I say to people when they start off okay Adam storytelling has more emphasis on storytelling than animation and I always give this example okay so if I made a video tomorrow and the story was about guys of the kangaroo okay would you watch it would you watch the a story about a kangaroo named Baz I know you wouldn't know you wouldn't know you wouldn't okay but then this six-foot white marshmallow boy comes out with Harry The Moth and everyone's like frosted over you know what I mean personality and the way you tell stories is more effective than the visual people know that his personality and the way he tells stories is so interesting they're literally willing to watch a story about a month a lot of lots of people it's a month so if you tell a story in an interesting and captivating way not only will the audience start to like you as a personality they'll also be more willing to watch a video outside the nice genre that you're currently doing think about it like this to new channels come and join our cozy little community and make storytime animation videos what makes videos with amazing visual but kind of shoddy storytelling whereas the other makes videos with stories that encountered the audience but with kind of rubbish off work so which one would you watch okay because if he adds it someone with better visuals and were storytelling how does it feel to have your pants on fire huh huh stinking liar you stinking liar what are you gonna do you gonna cry you're gonna cry you're gonna piss your pants maybe all this leads on to the next point that names made of which was that the true potential of the medium hasn't been realized after all these years and people are not taking full advantage of the freedom of animation a fellow animator by the name of Andre Derby I also said this where we don't realize the potential to turn raw they're too busy copying what works and there needs to be more experimentation and patent breaking this is repeated by a few more people as well now this is an interesting thing because I generally agree that we do need more experimentation and patent breaking but to say that it's not happening which is say that majority of people are not doing it it also in my opinion probably disingenuous to say because I voted the established craters understand that to really stand out and to hold on to the test of time they need to be more unique and so that's why slowly but surely you've been seeing changes ever so slightly in their content and for example James you know the most popular he talked about movies and PBS TV shows in his file even though that's not a story time Jaden is now shifting a little bit of a focus to have more substantiative content like you know mental health anxiety Rebecca param adding more of a theatricality and those are story time people who are trying to expand out I think we do have to give credit to the people who are rising up adding more spin to it like Dan planned for having more hypothetical content like Zelenka for having more skit based comedy and Andre I'm gonna give you a little bit of credit here as well for having in the now subjective commentary it's also for tech dollars that spins on day established genre so Amiri chu ditch the entire like comedic aspect that's not to say that she is not funny which she's not no kidding I'm just saying that she's now being more positive than anything else similarly saw some sketches went for a storybook thing and that's beautiful as well adding that a little bit of spice is necessary and I think that's what a lot of us are trying to do because if we go too abruptly and I want to mango be right back here but get it I said abrupt changes that's a joke Wow mango some people might be like hey amaz you should cut your mango i say no why should peel this mango and eat it like a degenerate no way was i up to we all want to move toward the desires without sacrificing the profit right if we make content that we want but to abruptly without really a transition phase for the audience you get a situation and I mean this is the most objective way like Tony be tuned in which he shifted so dramatically to his musical content and he alienated a lot of his already established animated fanbase and that's a no-no by the way if you haven't listened to his music yet you totally should I press they recommend detached and party Harvey because those have been playing on my sparked by playlist on Luke for weeks now I hate my life what am I doing with my life so do we need more pattern breaking absolutely and I've definitely got some things along my way and I know a lot of people in the community who've got things going their way as well so let's just see where it goes uh other thing that Nate mentioned was that how we should call ourselves cartoonists and not animators okay so this question had me going on for like five minutes and I'm not totally sure as to how I got here but homie Brown told me why call me Mommy call me daddy I don't care just call me okay so can't be here no basket bum and what mentioned that there's literally no style diversity when it comes to animation it with a few exceptions and the majority of have awkward personalities and we just need to change the care designs now interesting look cat I love you and you're one of my closest friends but what are you talking about with regards to style there's no style differences do you mean a visual style do you mean storytelling style I don't I don't get it so with the same personalities yeah look I can get that and we've talked about it before about them trying to copy some of the big boys but with the observation that most of the animators are introverted or awkward I'm not totally sure as to what else you would expect it's a job that requires people to stay indoors for days on end and drool over their tablets and his head to lights so it's no surprise that most of the people that come into it are or would or introverted to some extent that being said there are a few exceptions myself included and I do understand the craving for something different than those underlying personality traits but I'm sure that's gonna come with time I'm sure now with you guys to know style that's an interesting thought if you mean a visual style I've got to disagree with here if you look at the established animators anyway and compare Rebecca Parham - Jayden - err own story - da mix - ginger pale to species they've all got very distinct visual styles and to say this all the same is frankly like a little bit annoying you if you're talking about new creators of rise and craters and look you can't be too hard from them they just trying to do what works and they're trying to see what works I think none of us had a first video that we're exceptionally proud of okay am i one was uttering garbage similarly Haiti and Christina mentioned that there's too many people that copying color templates I've also got to give you a hard disagree here so what I'm gonna do is place five color schemes here okay and I want you to answer in the comments who do you think it is if you get it right and fantastic if you didn't whatever but if you are able to distinguish who the Creator is based on the color alone they've succeeded but if you're talking about new creators or rising creators then one of the things I can tell you if you're watching get a color scheme get a few colors that you think will remind people of you and stick with it okay you basically oh and I call you put a little picket in and go ah maybe one of you guys should go mango orange that might work [Music] so this person said why are the younger anima is underrated and they linked a bunch of people like swoosh and a beanie etc I don't think they are underrated you linked people who have a hundred thousand subscriber channels they're very rated that's a good amount as regards to why they may not be as a popular as some of the more established creators I think I've referred to Alex's comment which is that I really enjoy watching short time animations by older youtubers because they've had more experience and more time in life and more time to reflect and laugh at their mistakes rather than just ranting I'm 21 I'm not even that old but like if I ran to you about a crappy class I had you know what I mean that's an entertaining story but if I ran to about a crappy class I had and what I could have done to make it better oh well that's a theme you know it's like it's just so much better like that easier Cygnet Ally says that the only way for a newcomer to have any kind of success in the story time animation is if they're lucky enough to score a collaboration with the odd ones out for now I'm gonna give you a disagree here not a hard disagree but I disagree here is it true that if you call out with James there's a chance of success yes but it's important to know that it's just a chance there have been many many people who have collab with James but not long enough that's probably more common than people blowing up because of James and look I can't disagree a lot of people including myself have initially gained success from working with James there are a few people in the community who after working with James have not been able to maintain that newfound subscriber boost and actually plateaued or even died because of it I'll actually say if you are unable to pull off a collab it's probably more harmful to your channel than anything because now YouTube thinks that you're able to pull off those numbers all the time but then you release a new video and it's not able to pull off the numbers then what do you do what do you do then and so you really need to be able to create engaging videos as well as foster a loyal community after the collab to really maintain that momentum but with that being said I don't think you need a collab to succeed because even with the most recent people who have blown up within the community such as Amiri choose Sultan sketches aleem Asian Ritchie Alex's corner none of them have collab with the old ones app so now you don't have to have James within your videos to succeed you just need to make something unique to really stand out about the other channels there's just so much and I've been recording for an hour like this is just gonna be a nightmare to edit okay so I think I'm gonna stop it there so if you have any more hot takes any more controversial opinions any more spicy thoughts tweet it at me under the hashtag youma your opinions my answers and let's just talk about let's just talk about it guys let's just talk about it and I'll eat another mango in the next video have to sure to click on the link in the description below thank you so much for you listening to my opinions over me eating a mango and I hope that we can keep doing this and give me more mangoes write letters and Stan lousy roadworks ahead I hope his mangoes oh good okay so I want to make a more interesting that okay let me read through that so I'm gonna do those I just don't care call me what you want call me mommy home email mommy
