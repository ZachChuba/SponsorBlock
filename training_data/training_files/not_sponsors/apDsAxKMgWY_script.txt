with mini meatloaf ghosts
that's right who you going to call ghost meatloaf
oh yeah i'm going to show you how to take your favorite meatloaf recipe
and turn it into these absolutely adorable yet still incredibly terrifying
edible apparitions and not only are these easy and fun to
make they are also a delicious crowd pleaser
that will have your family cheering for more sorry i mean booing for more and
all we're going to need to get started with
is one batch of whatever your favorite meatloaf mix is
and if you don't have one you can just use this extremely quick easy cheater
version i'm about to show you now which includes one pound of lean ground
beef some salt of course as well as some freshly ground black
pepper and do not forget a few shakes of cayenne
otherwise i will haunt your dreams i also like to toss in a little bit of
minced green onion and then i tossed in a little chopped
parsley because i had it in the fridge but you don't really need that
but what you do need is some bread crumbs as well as one beaten egg
and then last but not least a splash of wash your sister sauce
and that's it we'll go ahead and take a fork and give this a mix
so as not to overwork the meat with our hot sweaty hands
which as you may know could result in a tough meatloaf
and by the way it's probably worth mentioning that you don't have to use
meatloaf for this okay your favorite meatball recipe would
also work or you could if you want just simply season some ground beef
okay if you're making these for kids they probably won't care too much unless
they're those children of the corn okay they're kind of particular but
anyway we'll go ahead and mix it up with a fork until it's just combined
at which point we'll stop wrap this up and refrigerate it for at least an hour
before we work with it okay you could use this right away if
you had to but if you let it sit in the fridge for like an hour
it's going to be easier to work with and probably taste better
so that's what i did and then an hour later i pulled it out
and then what we'll do is take 1 8 of this mixture and roll it into a nice
smooth ball which of course is a lot easier if we
dip our fingers in some water since as everybody knows damp hands make
smooth ghosts and then what we'll do once we have a
ball formed is we'll attempt to mold this into some kind of pear
shape ideally mimicking the physique of your average ghost
which shouldn't be too too hard but as i was doing this i couldn't help but think
this would be a lot easier to do on a pottery wheel especially if you had a
couple extra hands helping you with maybe some righteous
brothers playing in the background but anyway like i said we'll go ahead and
form that into a pear shape at which point we'll place that
down on a line sheet pan and as we say in the business the first
one is always the worst one and that was certainly the case here and
each one i did after that got a little bit better
but having said that don't obsess on getting these perfect since they are
going to get covered with a slice of cheese
sorry i mean sheet of cheese and that's it once we have those shaped
with ideally the head centered over the bodies they are ready to transfer into
the center of a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes or so or until
cooked through which i say is about 150 internal temp
and then what we'll do as soon as those come out
is place one slice of provolone cheese or the white cheese of your choice
directly over the top centering it as best we can
and what's going to happen is that residual heat from the meat is going to
start to melt that cheese and it's going to start to droop down
which is exactly what we want to happen but since these are so hot
and these are somewhat pointy shaped it's probably going to start melting
through the top like you see it doing here
which is why after that first slice is applied i'm going to take another
quarter slice which i just punched out with a round
cutter but you could just tear it or cut it into quarters
and we'll place that on top as well so we have a little more sheet for the head
and that's it as soon as these have been flying nunified we will pop those back
in our still hot oven for about 30 seconds
or until that cheese just starts to melt at which point we'll pull them out
and we will finish up a little bit of phantom fashion fine tuning
and for that we will take some of that cheese that's melting down around the
bottoms and we'll go ahead and wrap that and or
drape it over the top okay the more irregular the better and
just like when we shape the bodies don't worry about trying to get these
perfect since as these sit that cheese is going to continue to melt
and you're going to lose most of the detail but that's okay
because as you'll see once you sit for a minute or two the appearance is going to
become very ghost-like and not just with the shape but also the
color okay most halloween themed ghost-shaped foods are too white
but here our sheets are way more realistically dingy
i mean you think ghosts have access to washing machines well they don't
so after a few centuries their sheets get pretty nasty
but anyway once we're happy with how that part looks we will take the tip of
the knife and form the eyes and the mouth whoops i
just hit the tripod or at least i hope that was me and i
think the secret to a truly terrifying ghost face
is to make the mouth more vertically shaped than horizontal
okay i want my ghost to look more like it's screaming and not like it's
smirking but anyway do it any way you want since
when it comes to the facial expression you are after all the patrick swayze of
how crazy but personally i don't want a pleasant
smile and prefer something much closer to a tortured scream
oh and do not try to form a nose right everybody knows your nose falls off when
you decompose oh you didn't know well now you have
that to look forward to and that's it once we're done forming
those facial features we can finish up by going around maybe tucking in the
sheet a little bit at which point these are ready to serve
with whatever sauce we're going to pair them with
which in my case is going to be a pool of blood oh yeah i got a couple really
nice pints from a free range grass fed drifter
although not really so much grass-fed as grass sedated
but anyway if you can't find blood to serve these on you can substitute with a
mixture of ketchup barbecue sauce and hot sauce
which is also very nice and that's it my mini meatloaf ghosts were ready to enjoy
and yes i know that is a very haunting image but who cares how cool these look
or how ghoul these look if they don't also taste good
which these did okay not surprisingly a hunk of meatloaf covered in melted
provolone cheese is very tasty and for your adult guests what makes
these truly terrifying is the added horror they're gonna feel
as they realize their meal of dinner is getting cold while you carve the face
now that is scary so don't take too long and if you're like me the best part of
meatloaf is when it gets cold and you make sandwiches out of it
so yes with the leftovers we did enjoy a little ghost on toast
which was michelle's idea but anyway i went ahead and plated one up so i could
take some pictures and then i sliced off the head so i
could take another bite but also so i could end the video with a
visual of a bloody neck stump and when it comes to food if there's
something more halloweenish then a ghost meat loves bloody neck stump
i don't know what it is which is why i really do hope you give these a try soon
