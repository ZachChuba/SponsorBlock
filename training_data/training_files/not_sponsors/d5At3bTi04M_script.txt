to make an RPG really sing to have it be the type of experience everyone in the group talks about for days or even years after there's a concept all of your players have to understand reciprocity more specifically positive reciprocity giving the gift of making other players look good and surprisingly a lot of the time that's all about learning to embrace your own characters failures [Music] this episode is brought to you by skill share an online learning community where you can fuel your curiosity creativity or even your career for a two month free trial click the link in the description below any web is back in the writers chair everyone and he's going to teach us how to embrace failure not that Eddie himself is a failure by any means I mean his Kickstarter for Pirates of pug' Meyer was a roaring success thanks everybody but as he was writing about scurvy sea dogs and cantankerous catfish he started to compile his thoughts on how to expand his previous episode about winning and losing in tabletop games you see years ago when Eddie first realized that you can win or lose in an RPG he tried to be a winner he maximized his dice pools considered the cost and benefit of all of his characters actions and did everything he could to make sure that he never made a mistake and as a result he ended up with very safe but very boring characters then in one game his character said the wrong thing to the wrong character at the wrong time and just as things were about to get real dicey another player stepped in to salvage the situation and it was at that moment that Eddie just decided to roll with it and his so-called missplay went on to be one of the most memorable RPG experiences he ever had so why was that because by quote-unquote losing he had inadvertently given another player a chance to shine and the other players remembered that tabletop RPGs are as much about weaving a story as they are about playing a game and in good stories conflict is one of the things that makes a character interesting in a novel or a movie the narrative steadily raises the stakes tabletop RPGs however don't always follow that same progression therefore many modern designs and cent device failure in order to emulate that rising tension some really good examples of this or the momentum rules in Sion and Trinity continuum as well as the tagging aspects in fate how you fail can actually help other players have a more engaging experience which can in turn make the game far more engaging for you as well and that's where we get into reciprocity reciprocity is the innate instinct to respond to a social action in kind for instance if someone gives you a gift you might feel you should give them a gift back in fact in 1923 a French sociologist named Marcel Mauss pushed the idea of the gift arguing that exchanging objects builds relationships between humans because giving a gift to someone isn't really the whole process instead you give someone a gift they receive it then they often reciprocate by giving you a gift in return which you then receive however it turns out that favors can work the same way as physical objects - doing something for someone else can trigger the same human instincts as giving them a gift so if I do you a favor while I may enjoy the act of being nice I don't feel closer to you as a person until you do me a favor in return like for instance and this is just a totally off the top of my head idea Zoe still hasn't ever cleaned my bathroom even though I'm always keeping her litter box clean one time Zoe just one time is all I'm asking so how does this exchange of favors tie into tabletop RPGs well to answer that let's turn to one of the biggest improvisational storytelling forms in the world today professional oh yeah you heard me right for those who aren't aware pro wrestling is scripted like a reality TV show it's written to look like an authentic sports competition so there's a winner and a loser but those are decided in advance in order to make the best story and the fascinating thing is it's the job of the losing wrestler to do whatever they can to make their opponent look good and that's done through promotional skits body language and facial expressions all designed to make the opponent look like a credible threat in wrestling circles this is known as selling or making your opponent appear more powerful or skillful and the really cool thing is you can do the same thing at the table if you stumble or botch a dice roll you can sell that failure by embracing the loss when it happens rather than being bitter about it or flinging your dice across the table you can use that momentum to make someone else at the table look cool think of it as tension you're creating tension that can be used to help another character really shine which brings us back to Mouse if you do someone a favor they'll remember that and they'll be more likely to go out of their way to give you your moment in the spotlight later on and the more everyone helps everyone else look like a winner now the easier it'll be to fall into that habit later and eventually each player stops trying to get their time in the limelight and starts enjoying both the moments where they win and the opportunities to help other people look great and as a GM since all the players are both your collaborators and your audience giving them reasons to root for everyone is a great gift for the whole table so pick your moment and then give it to the person next to you because when they do it in return it'll make your game feel amazing whether you win or lose ah thanks Zoe what I'm not crying your cry and in that spirit of reciprocity those shots look cool do I have to buy a drone now [Music]
