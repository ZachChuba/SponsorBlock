Hey there Martians; Trace here. This is
episodes 3 of 5 on this series about LEAVING EARTH! So far, we've talked
about why we have to leave earth we've talked about the ways that we're gonna
be able to do it hopefully in the future and some of the ways that we're doing it
right now but now we're gonna talk about where we're gonna go I'm super excited
about this we have to leave the planet eventually we have to the planet is
gonna die we're gonna destroy it it will be destroyed if humans want to be around
and say a million years we cannot rely on nature to adapt us to that we must
rely on us to adapt us to that nature got us this far we need to go the next
mile so where should we go the Mars I asked some friends so let's
kick into it if we learned anything from the last episode it is that rockets of
the future will be a lot like Rockets now but we need people to actually want
to go places and we need a place to go thanks to people like Elon Musk a lot of
people are thinking Mars but is this viable well the National Academies of
Sciences engineering and medicine got together in 2014 and wrote a paper that
answered just that entitled pathways to exploration : rationales and approaches
for a U.S.. program of human space exploration! It's almost 300 pages, and
it's all about how human spaceflight should be and also can be my friend
Ariel was on that council so I called her! I'm Ariel Waldman I'm an adviser to
NASA I advise the NASA innovative advanced concepts program that looks at
futuristic ideas that could transform future space missions anywhere between
10 to 40 years down the line which you know here on earth antibiotics might be
able to be shelf-stable for maybe a year or so but expose them to radiation maybe
they're not as stable so things like that are important the National Research
Council says that there is basically no way that we can do this because the
NASA's budget has been flat it's not even adjusted for inflation it's
essentially flat year over year every year that means because it's not
adjusted for inflation we're giving NASA less money to work with the National
Research Council's findings say that they need to increase NASA's budget for
two to four percent above inflation for years and in due
so they can then work on a Mars landing and we need to do that with other space
agencies around the world because they aren't gonna be no merc a moment on mars
we got to do this together no one nation can go to mars on their own because it
is that much more difficult to go to mars than the moon and we need to have
everything go perfectly in sort of a unicorn and rainbows world and that
would mean that we would be landing humans on the surface of mars somewhere
in the 2050s i think people in this way sort of underestimate just how much is
needed to go to mars versus going to the moon and actually i think that is so
awesome we have to become interplanetary together as a group not as a nation or a
state or a little pithy description or even a single company or group instead
as a people a populous a species which just feels right when you're talking
about leaving Earth forever what would feel right is we all hate waiting and no
matter when we leave the planet we're gonna wait not only are we gonna wait
till the 2050s to actually leave but once we get to Mars we're gonna have to
wait this idea that like we land and then like after five minutes we'll just
like open the hatch and go on a walk like they're not gonna be able to do
that when you actually get astronauts onto the surface of mars everyone
imagines this monumental moment where like the doors open they've arrived on
mars and now they're just gonna go step out onto Mars the reality is is that
when astronauts go to Mars they're probably going to have to spend like the
first week or two inside that space shuttle or rocket or whatever they came
in because they won't be able to walk it's going to be too difficult for them
to walk on Mars because of the loss of all of that bone and muscle see this is
why people say scientists ruin everything humans did not evolve to live
anywhere else just here yes we can go places we can climb mountains top of
mountains will also kill us though we can dive underwater and being underwater
will kill you after a while because you know you can't breathe or you get
crushed by the pressure whatever space very similar another consideration for
going to Mars is that you actually want to go to Mars during solar maximum
rather than solar and this is because the Sun will
actually protect you from extra galactic cosmic rays which can be incredibly
damaging when in terms of radiation and what they can do to the body there's a
little bit to unpack here Earth has a magnetic field like a bubble like
shield's surrounding our planet and it stops us from dying
so thanks magnetic field thank you it's great and it does this by scattering
solar and cosmic energies that are flying around in space all the time the
Sun is constantly sending out the solar wind it's high-energy particles it's
high-energy rays and if those things hit our DNA it can hurt us deep space is
also sending cosmic energies our direction and some of these cosmic rays
from deep space aren't just invisible energy they're literally tiny bits of
atoms tiny protons flying through space superfast and when they hit something
they burst into x-rays I think we all know lots of x-rays is bad and since
these are such high-energy particles it can be damaging to our DNA Mars is a
difficult place to live on the best of days the average temperature is negative
63 Celsius not that that matters too much because it's got no atmosphere
which means you can't really breathe there and the atmosphere is a hundred
times thinner than Earth remember when Frank Sinatra sang up there where there
is rarefied pop songs they don't use SAT words anymore but atmospheric pressure
that low means a rarefied atmosphere it's rarefied air it's thin atmospheric
pressure at point six percent of Earth means that it doesn't actually matter
that it's cold on Mars because you won't really feel it because you're not
actually feeling the temperature you're feeling the air on your skin that's the
sort of a sidebar anyway also bad would be radiation in general without that
bubble the cosmic rays and the Sun solar wind and the sun's radiation could hurt
us the Sun seems all nice and yellow and friendly here on earth but in reality it
is a giant nuclear plasma furnace and it's not out there to protect us it's
out there because it is long-term exposure to radiation on Mars could
cause sickness and cancer genetic damage and even death so just going to Mars to
live may be not the best the way I describe having a large
population on Mars is why on earth would you want to have a large group of people
in in an intensive care unit I'm just maybe too acutely aware of how lethal
the place is I mean it really is lethal and why on earth would you want to raise
kids there that ray of Martian sunshine is Pascal Li you have a planetary
scientist with the Mars Institute in the City Institute I'm based at NASA Ames
but all opinions of my own and I think most people are happy they are Pascal
has spent his career thinking about humans going to Mars and I gotta say
he's not that into it I live and breathe space and space exploration I've done
that all my life and I really want to see humans go back to the moon and go to
Mars but somehow I don't resonate with the settlers I think a lot of the
attraction of Mars stems from the romantic view that's inspired by the
Martian landscape it looks like you know the the Unconquered frontier I would
prefer to see Mars becoming a you know a world park that is studied
scientifically with a research base and even several research bases a bit like
Antarctica 9 and 1/2 tourists and earth people who have an opportunity to spend
time there live there enjoy the place a bit but you know not raise kids I mean
you might have one park ranger who might be raising you know her family there
that's not settling Mars okay I mean that that's that comes with the
territory being a park ranger what if we lived under the surface and we used
local Martian resources would that be better of course a cave is a really
exciting environment on the moon of Mars because you are shielded from
high-energy ionizing radiation from the galaxies and from deep space and from
the Sun you are also shielded from micro meteorite impacts you are shielded from
the ultraviolet light and the Mars it's 800 times more intense than on the earth
because there's no ozone a study by beagle to a Mars probe found that below
190 nanometers waves heading to Mars were blocked
Arzo the atmosphere was rarefied but it was enough that it would block
UV radiation below 190 nanometers but above that not so much and UVC and UVB
radiation would fall above that so if you were on Mars as an astronaut and
somehow exposed your skin to the Sun you'd get a gnarly sunburn because there
wouldn't be enough atmosphere to stop all of that high-energy from hitting
your skin and of course over a very short period of time it would damage
your DNA so you've heard four you've heard against but let's wrap it up
should we go to Mars or not hey it's Ariel here again the rationales for
putting humans in space are actually really fascinating and the conclusion
was that there are pragmatic rationales and there are aspirational rationales
the pragmatic rationales to the economy national security
inspiration of students things of that nature you know science development on
the aspirational side however if we need to become a multiplanetary species to
survive or it's our shared human destiny to explore then human spaceflight
provides something unique the conclusion though was that it was the combination
of the aspirational rationales with the pragmatic rationales that argues for a
continuation of human spaceflight and that no one rationale was better than
another and no one rationale garnered majority of support we can be a
multi-planet culture and species by having footholds on all these places but
without kidding ourselves that necessarily everywhere we go we need to
turn that into a home because well we just haven't even done that on the earth
there are some places that are more pleasant than others but maybe you're
watching this in your thinking honestly according to Pascal Li and Ariel Mars is
out Mars is good for science but not great
for living I mean not for now for long term living we would need to figure out
how to stop cosmic rays where to live how to get stuff up there and not to
mention the psychological aspects of never being able to go outside at all
you can't feel a breeze that wasn't moved by a fan or a person walking by
you maybe not the best but that doesn't mean we have to not go to Mars I think
Mars is still valuable as a research base as maybe even a national park but
right now maybe we should think about something just a little closer right if
we are toddlers in the world of space exploration let's not try and go to the
next bedroom over let's just explore the room we have and that means going to the
moon could we live there forever you'll have to find out more next time make
sure you subscribe for all of the episodes in this series we're halfway
through that was episode 3 next is episode 4 about living on the moon and
then we get to Episode five and that's gonna be big so make sure you subscribe
again I am trace thank you so much for tuning in to this series I'm leaving
earth and I will see you in the future
