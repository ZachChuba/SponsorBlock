hey everyone Tesla Tom here thanks so much for joining us on ludicrous speed we're in our Tesla Model 3 performance stealth this morning using software update twenty twenty point twelve point eleven point one we're gonna go for a drive this morning on Cindy's North Shore on the Pacific Highway and we're gonna use autopilot as much as we can and also check out some of the full self-driving visualizations alright so what to turn right onto Pacific Highway northbound we will engage autopilot and we'll see how well the car goes I won't put it on navigating a royal pilot just a basic autopilot which is essentially you know cruise control with tracking aware awareness and also auto steer and lane keeping alright so to engage I'm gonna indicate two shakes down with the right stool kliebert as you can see the car between the two blue tram tracks there and occasionally the car will ask me to touch the wheel waggle the wheel just to make sure I'm still alive and still awake see that now that's green and a red there that's the double row of traffic lights that the car can't cope with just yet alright so see how far we can go up the highway with that manually driving so this was navigating on autopilot it would be one straight blue line that's basically the car getting me to where I want to go that's the easiest way I can explain navigate the autopilot where's where as basic autopilot is just like I said glorified cruise control with some lane-keeping would see this I'll go to a disengaged gets that car zoomed ahead of the red well of the of the amber light and I wasn't going to make it so I had to stop because like I said it doesn't react to traffic lights just yet and had I gone truth it would I would have run the red not good so that's okay this is where human interaction is still very much required to pay attention and to to make sure the right thing is done so once we drive off I'll engage again all right so to engage the grey steering will must come up as well and at top left corner there we go all right back on basic quarter pilots [Music] the school zones aren't in effect yet it's only 7:30 8:00 not quite yeah this person in front of me didn't need to go so slow but that's okay it's still 60 kilometers an hour that's fine we'll just five from now I could lane change I guess but heavier follow I'm always impressed with how well the car keeps the lane the most part of does Drive the middle occasionally it does like to either one side for some reason I'm going to engage a lane change it's really cool basically change the lane for me what I have to do is indicate see that yeah it does that sometimes when the lane markings disappear across intersections that's when car panics a little bit loses track that's why I've got my hands on the wheel to take over at any time all right like I said it's about sixty kilometers in there so it's not 40 kilometers an hour yet it's only 7:40 I'm in my road to go at 60 at this stage the lane change the lane markings on the road they're your rubbish pit on the leftists might do a drive through one of the neighborhoods when it's bin day then we'll see lots of bins on the screen well the test lab might wave to them no way back that's okay we still ways we still wish let's do a pretty good job so far so we're gonna drive all the way up to pretty much the mouth of the year m1 motorway at war Unga and that'll give us a very nice snapshot of where this car is at currently in May 2020 with regards to basic autopilot I'm gonna switch back to he left lane coming up to a red light but that's okay because it's a car ahead of me so what it's gonna do is basically come to a stop again if that was the first car I would I would certainly take over at this point cuz the car would just zoom in here it doesn't react to this line at this stage it's just yet interesting that this car is is black door greyed out I think that's just the car that it's following in terms of the traffic aware cruise control what I do love to is win this car I say when the light goes green and the car goes off it follows it very nicely from zero basically so I mean I've never seen a car do that pretty amazing I've got it on number to follow I believe it's a check for you all right that was number three let's get over to here mother got to it's a good Sydney city any closer would be tailing any further away cars will cut ahead of you so I quite like the opportunity rubbish bins it's not reading what we've got here in Australia is there not sort of carpool lanes but there sometimes we've got t2 and t3 lanes here in Sydney which is the ruling is that if it's like t2 you must have at least two occupants in the vehicle if it's t3 you must have at least three so that's something the car will need to sort out and I guess we can use sensors in the car so I pick a detector here another human and B you know the passenger seat or another human in the back forty three then you notice you can use that Lane it's just a single one trip in like look like the driver for example there was not to use that Lane so that's something the AI will have - I deal with in the program you'll have to deal with one day all right so we're coming up to a little bit busier traffic that's fine the car still follows the car ahead quite nicely the traffic is never that bad nowadays with the pandemic restrictions people are still not driving as much they were just fine by me really I get to get to drive around with less traffic okay so we're coming up to the crossroad with Mona Bell Road or ride road so what kind of pathway now journey now I've done a pretty good job I would think up from that one traffic light so far back at Lindsay all right now I've heard of me tried to beat the red so I was stuck having to cancel autopilot so far so good did my feet I always kind of need the pedals if I was doing a long road trip I would just rest my foot probably on the ground but given I'm in the city or least in a in a suburban environment I generally have my feet closer to the pills pedals just in case and my hands are kind of voyeurs always either on the wheel or very close to dancing light there right lights of turn green let's see how responsive the car is this time it's pretty good pretty smooth there's a no-entry wrong wayside it's the car we'll have to react to one day it is nice and stop-start traffic okay so there was a keep clear sign on the ground which the kaiser reacted to or hasn't seen yet so again something will have to be canceled because that lane on the left was ending do you want a risk there so I thought I thought the car would slow down there but it didn't I didn't see any Chevron's or anything that lane on the left wise ending and the lane markings were sort of heading this way too so that'll be nice if the car could react to that one day with you updates that when the left lane is ending and you're in the one they chase into it and cars are trying to get in then it would slow down but this car just kept going at 60 so that's why I took over the back to my point about the keep clear at the intersection that was near a fire station so the car didn't see the markings on the ground so I'm hoping the future updates that will be young that will be present and the car although eventually went on for so driving to keep clear of those intersection intersections where it needs to be cleared all right is heading to pinball now a couple more suburbs before we get to longer more cones there on your left anything that looks orange and white it will pick up a scone any safety I would say 95% of the time we've used autopilot now there's another ending lane this time there's no lane marking so small lights and bins tend to have multiple lights at Olympia needed at any intersection and sometimes especially in Sydney of the roads aren't always perpendicular to each other and intersections just the way out of pod reviews so out sometimes the light can be seen from your side I can't maybe set up so again something that he'll have to look at Tesla has a book out in the future okay so we're coming up to an interesting point there where the lane is ending but we've got sort of traffic markings it says there no liens marked so we just sell cones so there's the car reactor cones what does it freak out let's see that wasn't too bad actually that wasn't too bad at all they've got markings here because they do change the direction of the lanes depending on what time of Dana's you saw that with the example in the Sydney Harbour Bridge with time of day lane directions so sometimes in Sydney we've got that got cones and traffic markings to change it it's funny that took a while to get going that time a rough okay so we're just at our MOA quite North Mill more cones and you're right it's a lot of cones I guess it's not really kinda traffic markings that orange and white yeah I took over there that card is swerved to the right my car rather they freak that poor guy out okay so let plain ends what I'm going to do is just manually just merge them I write for spending lemurs rights I will have to try land in the ending and see what happens when I'm on basic autopilot I so I assume it's not going to turn to land for me but one day when I'm using navigator on a pilot and see whether the car gets out of a line that ends okay I'm gonna change lanes here very nice alright guys well I might finish video there thanks for watching guys stay safe if you enjoyed that let me call your comments and as always happy chat
