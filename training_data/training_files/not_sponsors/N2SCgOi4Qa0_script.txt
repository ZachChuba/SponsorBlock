but let's walk about to my channel if you are new here my name is Tom Harlock and I do not have an intro but I do plan on feasting on you if you do not send this video to five friends before midnight tonight only joking I won't expect you to have so many friends and I've just had a sandwich before I start but thank you Squarespace I appreciate it until today's video back when I have a dad one of the most prominent sales I can recall was the dial-up modem you know the one the other sound I fondly remember was this digital slag you have email apparently that's Joanna Lumley so number one soul show secondly that took me 25 minutes to find because apparently the more popular version of the AOL Mail symbol was an American man you got mail beautiful and nine times out of 10 that email would be junk however every now and again you get something a little bit more exciting such as this I am 10 years old when I was little my parents cut off my body parts with a rusty fall then they just threw them in the garbage if you do not send this to five people I will come into your room exactly 11:37 to cut off your body parts with a rusty fork as well better start copying and pasting better start copying and pasting better start the copy inning better start the copying pasting don't ever tell me what to do again you ten-year-old flip I live on the top floor hold earth you trying to get up these stairs when I was little and my parents cut off my body parts with a rusty fork and threw them in the garbage well how on earth you gonna cut off my limbs if you haven't got any limbs yourself I will pick up whatever remaining torso you have left put you in a pillowcase and just ping you out the window I'll put you in the garbage with the rest of your limb as your parents have the right idea you vindictive bastard god I'm heated up and I don't even film into two minutes today we are going to explore the phenomena there is chained messages I have a few to read out I know you also have a fun YouTube video for us to watch together it's well it gets pretty awful if for some reason you've been living under a rock you may not have ever received a chained message and if so count yourself lucky usually it's an email we need to send it on to an X amount of people or something really SuperDuper bad what happens you I thought chained messages we're going to be a thing of my past however recently I've noticed that they've been cropping up all over the places including Twitter and reddit and YouTube comments etc we share this for good luck or if you don't retweet this you're gonna get acne there are constantly messages online of people instructing you to share [ __ ] or bad stuffs gonna happen to you and I just wanted to let you know that this is all bollocks it's all massive piles of bollocks let me read you the chain message that I remember the most from when I was younger about 6 years ago in Indiana common winstead which pushed down a sewer opening by five girls in her school trying to embarrass her in front of her school during a fire drill in what world does someone try to embarrass someone by pushing them down a sewer what happened to the good old days when girls used to stick sanitary towels to each other's legs or whatever the police were called they went down and brought up 17 year-old common Winstead's body her neck broke hitting the ladder the girls told everyone she fell and they believed them if you don't repost this saying she was pushed or they pushed her down a sewer then Carmen will get you Eva from a sewer the toilet the shower or when you go to sleep you wake up in the sewer in the dark then Carmen will come and kill you it's very specific for something that's not ever gonna come true it's a very specific narrative this is a chain email regarding Jenny and if you don't know Jenny as well you're about to learn my name is Jenny I'm 16 years old and have dark blonde hair now that you have start reading this you may not start number one Jenny 16 year old Jenny with a dark blonde hair get highlights that's the cause of your issue that's the reason nobody likes you that's the reason their boys pay you attention Jenny I was murdered on July 14th with my father's shotgun a butcher knife if you do not send this the three friends bold of you to assume I a free French Jenny I will come to your house in the middle of the night and kill you with my father's shotgun a butcher's knife don't believe me where did you get that idea from Jenny but it was a really obvious and true situation from the beginning never felt so much reality the good thing about chain messages is they always give you proof so just in case you wanted to check your sources case one in 1998 Mariah Marshall from Pelham in Texas was showering and went to bed right after she was found dead the next morning that's what happens when you go to bed with wet hair you get hypothermia case - Keisha Jones from Nashville Tennessee fell asleep watch watching television and her mother heard a gunshot and a scream she found her daughter lying on the floor lazy [ __ ] her head was blown off non-porn room don't get a television I don't have a television according to the television license and people never had one in my life but in what year in 2002 Omar Wilkinson from Milwaukee Wisconsin was reading a book in bed he was shot and stabbed through a book after he fell asleep it just goes to show that you should invest in audiobooks simple solution to an obvious problem if you ask me Omar those are just a few examples of some of the emails that I received when I was younger that I did not pass on and I'm still living and speaking of things that are well and truly alive chained messages still are thriving if you are a fan of Twitter comm firstly following me following me willing now and secondly you've probably seen a few tweets like these flip your phone since you have read this you will be told good news tonight if you don't me tweet this your worst week starts now this has five hundred and thirty two thousand retweets I've never retweeted any of these posts and I have a really good luck retweet for clear skin I think that's all for you know people are gonna see these tweets and they're gonna have acne they're gonna have rosacea they're gonna have eczema they're gonna see these kind of tweets they're gonna think the reason they have these problems is because they didn't retweet it when in reality the reason that people have these issues with their skin is cuz they're dirty and unhygienic whilst doing some research on the chain message phenomena I found this little video on YouTube which I'm gonna have to watch with you it's one of the most disgusting degrading and embarrassing things I've seen online and I've watched my own videos I know you thinking oh my god Tom with your overhead headphones you look so cool and I really relate to you I would never change I'm a humble and I'm never gonna change only jokin I've airports I'm not Paul oh I wonder who this is oh if God was real that email to be from your speech that repair now that you have opened this email you have to read it what's upon a time there was a little girl named - Ava who found a penny so essentially this little girl Lea has received a chain message on her laptop she picked up the penny thinking it was good luck bad things started happening to Ava I think we both know that you've just typed that up on Microsoft Word this has the exact same energy as that Nellie and Carrie music video when she starts texting on Microsoft Excel Callie love you're using Microsoft Office she was having very bad luck and no one could help her well of course no one could help anywhere she's non-existent the only way that you can help her is to send this email which is a Word document to ten of your friends within the hour yes I did of the chain letter is true she's not ignore it or you will regret it I have to send it to ten friends in an hour I think she should spend a little less time on a laptop and a little more time cleaning her bedroom the filthy bastard he not stainer god I hope she manages to do this task it be bloody awful she got distracted or interrupted or something don't be late honey cuz we're gonna be late movie theater time Mia honey come on don't be late we're gonna be late for the movie theater honey don't be late honey that was sad chicken movie you haven't even moved three hours Scalf you're a lazy [ __ ] three three hours oh no the chain letter I forgot I'm gonna go to bed she's just gonna go bad weather crazy the next morning she hasn't sent the chain message last night she had a bit of a ruckus with the lampshade let's hope she has a brilliant morning why are you putting them on the bed oh that's great isn't it people don't you pissy feet on the bed well done love [ __ ] big woohoo I understand that sometimes you like wake up in the morning stand in some piss I get I have been there before as well but I can't comprehend a world but I would stand in piss and then put those pissy stinky piss ridden sopping moist feet covered in piss to them my bed which I can only assume is not covered in piss but looking at the way this doll lives her life I'm not too sure anymore so you lied about going the cinema and then you knocked over your lamp for no other reason than get an attention which I kind of understand I live for the drama -
