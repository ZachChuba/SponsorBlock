with banana bread pancakes
that's right they say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
and it reminds me of a lesser known proverb and that's that a batch of
banana bread pancakes begins with a single overripe banana
which is exactly what inspired this video and by the way if you're a fan of
our banana bread then you're gonna love these since it's
based on that recipe and as easy as that is to make
these are even easier so with that let's go ahead and get started by mixing up
our dry ingredients which are pretty much standard for any
kind of pancake and includes some white all-purpose flour
some salt some baking powder and some baking soda
and then once all that's in there we'll take a whisk and give this a mix until
everything is thoroughly combined and once that's set we'll just set it
aside and move on to the wet ingredients which will begin with one very very ripe
banana all right one where not only the outside is getting dark
but the inside is also very soft as you can see here part of the inside is
turning color as well which is not the most beautiful thing
ever but for banana bread or banana bread pancakes that's exactly what we
want and what we'll do is take a potato
masher and mash this down into a paste and while an almost black banana is
recommended here as long as your banana is fully ripe
and you're able to mash it fairly smooth it should still work for this recipe
but anyway like i said we will mash that very smooth at which point we'll go
ahead and toss in one large whole egg along with a little touch of white sugar
and then what we'll do is grab our whisk and give this a thorough mixing for
about two minutes or so or until basically that sugar's
dissolved and we have a nice smooth creamy frothy mixture
and then to that we will add a splash of milk as well as some real pure vanilla
extract and sometimes if you're smiling at your
food it will actually smile back hello vanilla and then we'll finish this
batter up with some melted butter some fairly finely chopped walnuts and
then our previously put together dry ingredients
and then very important we're going to take our whisk and mix this until it
just comes together and what that means is as soon as you
see that flour disappear you can give it one or two more stirs but then you got
to stop otherwise at that point you might be
over mixing and that's something you want to be conscious of as soon as you
start to mix since it's very easy to space out and
just keep stirring for like another 15 seconds after all that flour's been
incorporated okay so for the tenderest pancakes
possible just as soon as this batter comes together we're gonna stop
and then we're gonna let it rest for 10 minutes before we use it which will give
our flour a little bit of time to hydrate
and for our baking soda and baking powder to activate so that's what i did
and about 10 minutes later my batter looked like this and that's it we can
head to the stove where i have a generously buttered pan
set over medium-high heat and i'm gonna go ahead and transfer in
enough batter to make three and by the way this one banana size
recipe will probably make about six pancakes this size
although as they say your results may vary but anyway i transferred in about
half my batter and once we do what we'll do is reduce
our heat to medium and we'll cook that first side for about
three minutes or so and then flip him over
but we cannot should not will not go by time okay what is much more accurate is
going by what we see and what we're looking for is the
outside edges of the pancake to start looking a little bit dry
as well as and more importantly small air bubbles will start popping up
through the surface alright you see those and when that
happens it means it's officially time to flip your pancakes
which i will attempt to carefully do in this probably a little bit too small pan
and by the way if you're keeping score at home that did take about three
minutes but again forget about the time only
believe the bubbles okay so figuring out when to flip is
going to be up to you i mean you are after all the craig mack
of when to flip your banana flapjack oh and speaking of flavor in your ear
one off the record suggestion if you want these a little more decadent
is before you flip them you can sprinkle on a little bit of chopped dark
chocolate which of course is the secret ingredient
in our famous banana bread recipe in case you're in the mood for something
a little more desserty and then however long the first i took
we'll give that second side roughly the same amount of time
at which point we'll go ahead and plate up just like they tell you how to do it
in the food blogger handbook so i went ahead and stacked my cakes and
added a little extra slice of butter to the top
because why not and then if you want as a garnish
if you happen to have a ripe but not too ripe banana we can go ahead and dress
this up with a few slices which not only looks nice but it gives
our guests a little heads up about what they're getting into
and then i decided to serve mine with some more maple syrup
and please do not pour it over too fast because it's so beautiful
okay so savor this site and enjoy the moment
and then for a final touch i added one more pinch of chopped walnuts
and that's it my banana bread pancakes were ready to enjoy
and that my friends if you enjoy banana bread and pancakes
it's just gonna be an incredible bite of food all right i really think this
recipe threads the needle between something that has the flavor of
banana bread yeah very close to the texture of a classic pancake
all right what we don't want to do is just fry some banana bread batter and
call it pancakes nor do we want to make regular pancakes
that are just banana flavored and this is neither so i really do love
how this recipe comes out and i just used them as a garnish but
for a little more filling meal feel free to slice over a whole banana
as these pancakes are very nice eaten alongside of the fresh fruits
and by the way i have no idea why i'm trying to eat these stacked
okay that was just for the pictures i generally like to eat my pancakes one at
a time so let me keep it real and show you how
i would actually eat these oh yeah that's better but anyway that's
it how i like to make banana bread pancakes
whether you're trying to disappear a rapidly blackening banana
or you're just about to head out on a thousand mile journey and you want a
delicious hearty breakfast before taking that first step
either way i really do hope you give this a try soon
