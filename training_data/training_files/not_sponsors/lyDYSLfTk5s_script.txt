cares about your twitch let's jump into the video white wyvern starting off the countdown of the most unique accounts season 3 episode number 1 is the account white wyvern white wyvern was the first to level 3 to completely max a hardcore ironman account he's amassed nearly 9 000 hours since starting the account in 2018 he has over 500 million total experience including five skills over 50 mil woodcutting crafting smithing mining and thieving he currently has five stats inside the top 10 across all hardcore ironman accounts including three ranked twos white wyvern has held multiple rank ones across all hardcore accounts including rank 1 smithing for 16 months and rank 1 construction for 6 months he even has held rank 1 total for all level 3 skillers for 2 months and again that's as a hardcore ironman account white wyvern has a long history of playing ironman accounts being the first player to a 200 mill on an ironman account on his account night viper and the skill was thieving a fun fact about white wyvern is that this is actually his second level three hardcore ironman account his first level three hardcore ironman account was knight wyvern and that died at 1394 total level while doing a tree run and brim haven 2 spiders before it died knight wyvern held rank 1 construction for all hardcore iron man accounts at 15 million construction experience in this ironman account i mentioned earlier knight viper held rank 1 construction for ironman accounts during its prime call this guy bob the builder he's held rank 1 construction at some point on three separate accounts white wyvern's long-term goals include getting 99 slayer and also 1600 total level he's currently 82 slayer and his method is fossil cleaning at just 2k slayer experience per hour he needs another 5 250 hours for 99. after 99 slayer white wyvern will begin working on some 200 mils the next player to be featured in the most unique accounts season 3 episode number 1 is the player tyoga tayoga is 60 attack 99 strength and one defense with 99 magic and 99 range sitting at just 78 combat as you probably could have guessed tioga's account was originally inspired to pk in the early days of his account tayoga was a pking machine amassing over two thousand bounty hunter kills after getting bored of pking tyoga set a goal to completely max his peer that goal came true achieving the highest total level possible for his build at 2057. after maxing tioga found himself bored again and instead of going back to pikeng he decided he wanted to move on to pet hunting today tayoga has achieved 18 pets and that's with only one defense and also no overhead prayers he's only 16 prayer tioga has over 700 efficient hours bossed including 6 000 dagging off rex kills 5500 zara kills 2500 kalisto kills and 2 000 cal fight queen kills something awesome about tayoga's account is he got the full slayer pet collection before 99 slayer which includes the pet smoke devil hell puppy hydra noon kraken and the abyssal orphan this was possible due to tioga doing turial skipping to 99 slayer other accomplishments include achieving the champions cape all castle awards halos 75 million ranged experience 50 million smithing experience 38 million hit points experience and 35 million magic experience tioga's future goal on his account is really simple just get as many pets as possible evan abbey okay so i must admit this next one is a little bit different than any account i've featured before in this series the reason why is because the accomplishments have been accumulated through the results of making hundreds upon hundreds of accounts our next feature is the old school runescape speedrunning champion avenabi avenabi currently holds all of the major old-school runescape records on speedrun.com these records span between both free-to-play and member worlds as well as between both standard and iron man game modes his list of record times include entering the champions guild completing the black knights fortress quest obtaining mithril gloves obtaining the arty cloak 1 completing dragon slayer and the most sought-out record the fastest tutorial island run in soup speedrunning video in december of 2019 a guy by the name of research had the fastest tutorial island run by a staggering amount of time 23 seconds i remember watching that video and saying to myself yeah there's no way anyone's going to beat that record but fast forward to nearly eight months later in august of 2020 ivanabe beat that record by a whole 6 seconds it's insane how good this run is it's nearly ticked perfect at least according to him evan abby did the run in 281 ticks and believes the theoretical best as of right now is 273 ticks which would even put him 5 seconds faster if he was tick perfect at 2 minutes and 43 seconds i'll leave a link to his run in the description it's absolutely incredible my friends that's the best way other than following me on twitch to support the channel berserker next on our countdown is the player perserker berserker was the first player to obtain a champions cape at 20 hit points we've seen a few low-level champion keep features in previous seasons but they were all 21 hit points or more the reason why 20 hit points is such a feat is because after killing each champion a player automatically gains experience in the hitpoint skill after killing all 11 champions the experience adds up to 20 hit points and since you can't use a cannon it comes down to a lot of skill to shave off as many hit points experienced as possible upon completion berserker was one of the lowest combat levels to ever step foot into a 1750 total of a world at 49 combat today he's now 51 combat getting two additional combat levels while cannoning venonatus for the pat it took him three thousand and fifty eight venonatus kills to get the pet spiderling the crazy thing about his venonetta's pet grind is it took him over 750 hours averaging 15 minutes to get each kill by cannoning to reiterate he achieved a venonatus pet at 51 combat with 20 hit points one defense and 11 prayer the prayer by the way was the reward from priest in peril which was needed to get the goal scroll for the champions cape future goals on berserker's account include trying to complete the wilderness boss pet set and also get 99 slayer through wildyslayer rez rounding out season three episode number one of the most unique accounts is the player reds rez was the second ultimate iron man skiller to max's account in old school runescape he officially maxed in december of 2019. since then rez actually decided to go for 99 strength to make the perfect 35 combat ultimate iron man hobby mauler he's been leveling strength by doing 3-tick barb fishing and currently has 175 mil fishing experience at the time of this recording it's interesting to note that reza's first 50 million fishing experience came from aerial fishing where he got an incredible 48 golden tenches to date red said that his hardest accomplishment was 99 hurbler reds got 26k herbivore kill count for all the herbs and then had to farm all the secondaries by getting the seeds from the master farmer in total reza's account has over 10 000 hours into it he has some incredible high experience and different skills including 200 million fire making 125 million hunter 100 million runecrafting 70 million thieving 60 million agility and of course 175 million fishing mentioned earlier this account is insane it has five stats within the top five for ultimate iron men and eight stats in the top 10 for ultimate iron men reza's future goals include finishing 200 ml fishing which will give him 99 strength and complete his perfect ultimate iron man hobby mauler and then do some other 200 mils he has his sights on cooking and hunter next yeah bye
