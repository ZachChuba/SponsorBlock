[Music] oh my gosh that's a model y oh my gosh hold on hold on hold on go say hi what is going on everybody welcome back to another video today we're looking at tesla's latest software update 2020.24.6.1 we have a bunch of really good improvements here software updates have been really good lately we've been getting a lot of features in the updates and we've been getting a good amount of updates lately before we appreciate that welcome to the frunk so heading out here we're going to go look for some green lights we'll talk about all the features on our way there i'll also put up a nice picture of the release notes if you want to pause so you can check those out but the first biggest feature is now autopilot will go through green lights can you believe it this is revolutionary no other car company has thought of going through green lights like tesla has and we're going to try it out today so you actually to go through a green light you actually need a lead car in front of you so we'll have to find the right scenario but no big deal it is really exciting it is going to improve the user experience of this and it's a nice baby step to get more autonomous features into our cars now the software still won't make turns at intersections but there is some interesting language here talking about learning and it'll get new abilities or whatever and i don't know exactly they're not very clear they're not saying like soon we're getting turns or anything like that but it sounds like it's coming um from this language it's going to be here i mean we know eventually but maybe sooner than we thought so next up is backup camera improvements really cool here so now we have the side repeaters you can look at live so i can pull that up now we can just hit this now this is how it's always been we've seen the backup camera but you pull this up temporarily you get a little car icon here with a blue graphic to show you which camera like where the camera is looking and this is what we can see this is live happening right now very cool for checking your blind spot eventually hopefully in the u.s regulatory approval will come so you don't need mirrors on the outside they actually cause a lot of drag and reduce efficiency and we can just have something like this some car companies have them you know off to the side where your mirror would be but with this i can now see my blind spot without looking back i can just take a peek at the screen you know as i'm driving and i can see nobody's in my blind spot make a lane change so very cool i'll also love this feature for doing tesla challenges and driving videos i think you guys will really appreciate that you'll be able to see a lot more of what i'm seeing you cannot make these any bigger though so the next feature is dash cam viewer improvements um stopping at the double stop sign doing a good job with that when you look at a sentry mode clip it'll have a little red spot for you there on the player so that you can see where the event occurred that triggered sentry mode because you get 10 minutes of video you get some before and some after the event occurred so this way you can much more easily go directly to where the event occurred you can see if the file is valuable if you care about it and if it's not you can just delete it and move on tune in improvements so tune in is if you don't use spotify it's the built-in uh media player the internet connected media player for podcasts and all that um so looks fine to me i haven't really played with it too much so if you search for a podcast play grounded podcast so that'll come up number one that's my podcast if you're not subscribed if you enjoy podcasts or whatever all right to finish up the release notes before we get to the green light uh walk away door unlock now you can make it so when you're home your doors won't automatically lock a feature the car's had for a long time is when you walk away the doors automatically lock and at home for me that's annoying i park in the garage i don't really need that and thank you jeremy judkins check out his youtube channel [Music] oh my gosh that's a model y oh my gosh hold on hold on hold on i'll put a timestamp if you want to skip this part oh go say hi [Music] all right that was super exciting sorry okay let's keep going so walk away oh it's so amazing and you got that's what i would get i mean maybe a different color because i have that color but those wheels all right let's let's focus here um walk away door unlocks whatever you can leave it unlocked at home yay uh cabin camera so this one is kind of weird because you can't actually like see it yourself um but in case of an accident or something you can if you want enable this camera and if there's an accident or whatever footage and pictures will be recorded sent to tesla to help with safety and data and whatever so i kind of take this as like you're texting and driving with autopilot and you crash then they can really be like ah forget you um but you never know all right so while we're here let's check out the sentry so you can see the little red dot here he didn't recognize me but i mentioned the channel he's like oh yeah i've seen it so that was cool so yeah there's your red dot you know and then you can go and see what triggered it so we're getting closer so you can click pretty close uh and there so whatever happened here you know we are standing there talking so that triggered it um and then that's it so now you can see you know a lot quicker what made it happen all right so here we are out in traffic we have a green light and the car is going i did not confirm that i just turned it on you can see this green line here before that was red always now it's going to be red only when the car is going to stop and it'll be green when the car's gonna go it'll make this ability a lot nicer to use so if you have a lot of green lights in a row of course you don't have to keep hitting this and hitting this and hitting this so i'm curious what will happen here we're stopping at this red light it'll turn green i probably won't have to confirm and there it is okay oh my gosh the acceleration is good all right i thought it was going to be faster it's good it's not bad oh and then it gets confused by this one oh that's so annoying but that's okay so we have another green light maybe it'll change maybe it won't um so that is awesome oh my gosh this these updates are just insane so it says stopping uh nobody's behind me so i'm gonna see yeah so it's red now now if i touch the accelerator it turns green it means it's going through i didn't have someone in front of me there and as described in the release notes it was going to stop on green so speed is still restricted on non-divided highways for this one no surprise there i really want that to go away but another green light we should go right through it this video please hit like and get subscribed it really helps the channel so going through these green lights this experience is already so much better i am so happy with this update already um i've been doing some driving things seem to be working really well this guy wants to cut us off but you know my car will do the braking for me no big deal uh so that's good and then it's still breaking i'm not sure why i'm gonna hit the accelerator to speed up a little bit but we would have went through that green light no problem here's another example of green light with no lead car so my car is gonna stop just hit that and bam there we go i should have these cameras up for you guys so you can see more what's going on got this new ability why not use it one other thing really great guys so overall this update is really nice i'm loving it i am really excited of course about the green lights but also just staying unlocked at my house that's huge for me and then changing my wheels um that's really cool so i think i don't know if i showed this earlier but i changed them to this because it's more similar to what my wheels look like did not confirm that green light by the way so this is working great oh i also have my follow distance really high so this is another feature i don't think i mentioned this but there are some other things in the update that tesla didn't mention and this is one of them now you can have arrow wheels with the cap kit so with the arrow caps off and they also added the new uh 20-inch wheels i forget what they're called like uh zero g i think wheels so they added those as well and now you can change your car to have that if you have that so that's really nice i think there were a couple other things that came with this update that may not have been uh mentioned in the release notes i will put those in the description so check for that just in case i didn't include those so i hope you enjoyed this video uh these updates they're just so awesome i'm so excited uh and that model y that made my night uh i'm gonna turns out he lives like five minutes for me not even like two minutes from me so we may be seeing him on a y video soon so anyway i hope you enjoyed this one i look forward to talking down in the comments and you will see my car in the next video so autopilot and i are [Music] you
