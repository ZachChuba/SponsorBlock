you know what is going on guardians and welcome back to another destiny 2 gameplay video in this video we're gonna be talking about the exotic 150 hand cannons limited to the thorn the Sun shot and the Lumina so as you may very well know at this point there were some changes to hand cannons with the launch of shadow keep and included in those changes were things like recoil animation changes for 150 weapons right 150 hand cannons that's a big deal for these 150 s that have been sort of under the radar for so long because of the just crazy screen shaking you know a recoil that we've had to deal with for so long so we're gonna chat about where they are in the current state of the game right now but before we dive into raid Shadow legends now back to the destiny content now we're talking about these 150 hand cannons specifically Sun shot thorn and Lumina which will she you'll see a little bit of Lumina in the background from time to time but mostly focusing on thorn and Sun shot as the title of this video suggests I believe that these guns are in a pretty fantastic state right now in the current sandbox and that's not limited to 66 it pours over into a Elam it pours over into comp the Survival playlist and you're gonna see gameplay from literally every kind of playlist in this video and obviously in most of those settings almost all of them skill based matchmaking is on so consider that when viewing the gameplay so why are these hand cannons better than they used to be if hand cannons got nerfed right that's the question because hand can take the gunner the range got reeled in a bit by a bit I mean no it's pretty it's pretty noticeable it really is pretty noticeable but there's a couple of hand cannons that they have some core identifying features that help them sort of overlook some of those changes not all of them but some of them and two of those hand cannons are yes thorn and Sun shot Sun shot has the sort of explosive rounds built into the gun and that makes it so that you know about half of that damage that you're doing is locked in that explosive damage and it's immune to range changes so it's immune to range damage drop-off so there are there are times when I'm doing like 12 damage in in what you might call real bullet damage but then on top of that I'm doing like 24 explosive damage so be getting like this depending on where you're at you know mid 30s for damage at long range where the hand cannon is really freakin good like that's really good for out long range with the hand cannon right so you can out do a lot of hand cannons because they are affected by the damage drop off when you are not necessarily severely punished for it because you've got that explosive damage in your sunshine and on top of that it's also gonna do this big freakin explosion when when they die the catalyst is really freakin good for Sun shot but that range and stability the range is like it's it's a huge jump not a minor jump on the catalyst and I don't know if I don't know if there's a point in this gameplay where I'm inspecting my son shot but I have got almost 11,000 kills with this thing in the crucible I love Sun shot a lot of it it's really freakin good and with the changes to the recoil direction and the buff to the mag size for Sun shot it is actually a competitor now when it formerly it was a bit of a meme and you really had to lean into it pretty hard in order to make it you know any kind of good in the crucible now let's talk about thorn thorn also gets to bypass some of the the range drop-off punishment because of the damage over time that thorn can do so you can tag people multiple times from range and still get that dot applied to them so they're gonna take additional damage on top of the damage of your bullet hitting them so that helps to offset the damage that you lose at range with the damage drop off that hand cannons don't have to deal with it they have to suffer through so again that's gonna help you especially when you're doing other hand cannons in the crucible and on top of that thorn is just a phenomenal gun when you get the sole devourer perk active and you start doing seven damage on your dot it's insane is insane amount of damage it makes it a two tap when you are in the the intended range for thorn and a very consistent three tap when they are passed that damage drop-off threshold for thorn that takes it down to a four time it can still be a three tap because of sold of hours so thorn and Sun shot they both get to bypass some of the laws that are binding hand in the crucible right now and making them not as a fact that they need to bypass some of those laws and that's that makes them feel more exotic to me when previously they didn't feel quite as exotic because they're going up against things like Lunas how and not forgotten and spare rations just these really freaking good and consistent lethal hand cannons spare rations especially on console its use its usage rate was was more than cut in half since shadow keep dropped a lot of people are holstering that for you know for good or bad whatever your opinion on that may be one of the side effects of that is that these exotic hand cannons are feeling more exotic now because there are fewer major players that can compete with them at range now granted if you are in the intended range if you're up close and personal you might still get out dueled by these things you're still gonna get out duel probably by a not forgotten just because it doesn't have to deal with things like recoil I'm I mean it's a bit of an exaggeration it does have recoil but it's a very minimal and the same thing applies to Lunas house so you'd really have to have a good shot up closer we're gonna be out dueling those things so try to keep them if you can intentionally at just on just on the edge of that range drop off if you can sort of visualize that range and to keep them right there in that sweet spot where you're gonna be doing extra damage compared to them and you can out duel them a little bit more consistently now lumina obviously lumina only got affected by the 150 recoil visual recoil changes and that did actually help it to become a little bit better in the crucible and I actually really like this gun I think it feels really good it feels very consistent it's got great handling it it already was in my opinion one of the better one 50s in terms of the visual recoil and being able to manage that before the changes but even more so after the changes I actually had a lot of fun using this thing in elimination where I would get a pick I grabbed that noble round I just dumped it real quick and then ape somebody when I had the buff applied to me after dumping the noble round and I would do even more damage it would help offset the penalties to the range on hand cannons just because I had dumped that noble round onto somebody actually had some clutch plays in Elam with that buff and it was a good feeling because you know you're thinking the guys on the other side are like he did that without what other that alumina four realize you know Lumina and that's a great feeling when you use something like that you find out a clever way to make it actually in the context of that of that gunfight better than the other guys gun you know what I mean like I'm intentionally taking alumina and making it better than his not forgotten I'm making it better than his last word I'm making it better than his spare rations whatever it may be because I'm dumping that noble Ram not being really intentional about how I play and making sure that my first pick I'm doing the final damage town with a melee guy with a grenade I want to lead with those things and clean it up with the hand cannon with alumina then get that noble round you know in in my gun so I can I can dump it off when I need to I actually was able to save my teammates lives a couple of times doing that as well so I was able to even lean into the support role of the Lumina while experimenting with it I had a lot of fun with it so I would highly encourage you guys pick up these 150s again and experiment with them see how they feel and the great thing is they're not limited to one slot I mean you got Sun shot and the energy of thorn in the kinetics so regardless of what weapons special weapons you'd like to use you've got options so you can tool your build how you want it to be now I was using enhanced hand cane and targeting enhanced hand cannon dexterity enhanced hand cannon reload speeds unflinching hand cannon mods I was I just i stacked myself out like I was in most of this gameplay I'm not even running any special ammo scavenger perks because I'm loaded up on paragon mods annexed and the enhanced dexterity instead so I was trying to really focus on my hand cannon dueling skills and less on the special but I hope you enjoyed the gameplay and I'd love to hear what you think about these 150s right now and post your comments in the comment section I do read all those so think social watching the video I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day be warm and well fed my friends and hope to catch you in the crucible
