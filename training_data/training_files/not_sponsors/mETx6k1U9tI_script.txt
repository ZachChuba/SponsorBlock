how is train cleared train went to the right side and hoffu was alive uh us three did lights together and then train and i left so he couldn't have killed hoffenheim i'll explain later well oh no train's just out i have to i have to get rid of her what the [ __ ] are you good why though he just needs to go this one just died off baby oh good job uh so avilee's body is dead outside of weapons and i think dk's body isn't calms i think coffee is clear so you said it just died oh dk's was dead when i was on vitals and lazy purple is there and then avalis just died but i mean i was wrong report so uh train couldn't have killed avelly's body then moxie where did you come from who's okay uh i was in vitals then i went to admin then i saw you coming in and you were on download hafu couldn't have killed blue or light green uh i think light green had to have died in the last three seconds lazy purple is pro is also clear for both kills does that mean i can't but anyways who's i went to do left reactor but it ended up being uh sketchy did it i went down did download in uh o2 and then also did uh o2 tree tasks where are you right now wait do you know where ovi's uh obi's body is is it in o2 no it's right outside of weapons outside i think they could then light train i run up to do lights and now i'm running back into o2 because i think it's like euro testing lights second that light started dimming dk died i have a question so it was only lazy purple that you mentioned and then now moxie's mentioning and he's there and he clears both of you so yeah i asked i i asked moxie where he came from yes so so who are the clear people so lazy lazy mocks you're clearing each other i'm clearing train blastoise italian uh you haven't actually and you tried to clear me really early i think it's hollywood um it's interesting she said do you know where the body is not do we know where the body is that's what's got me no it's because she she instantly said at the very start of this entire meeting all right when i um i i'm like tempted to save this just so people don't see the second part and no it's fine scotch talia nobody here nobody here nobody here oh he killed hafu what what number are we at okay that's why i thought o2 uh yeah in the water wheels okay so uh this is kind of easy i think uh lazy not moxie yeah ladies and gentlemen could not have killed uh the first round five up couldn't have killed yellow scotch couldn't have killed because i ran through specimen train couldn't have killed either yeah i'm blastoise couldn't have killed guess who i said it was the first round and i swear to god though it is literally not marxist everyone's so silly because uh train went to the right side and hoffu was alive uh us three did lights together and then train and i left so he couldn't have killed hafu and i have one question before i got to lights did i cross over you moxie no no no someone crossed over me like on the corner of office area going down and could train not have just ran back after lights no because no because train left from the right side and i checked vitals right away moxie what are you scared of buddy i'm scared of uh talia might be good and train and five might not be yeah yes yes i am i thought you meant good at the game i'm not good at the game but hey don't slow yourself short yeah this huge imposter win earlier who did this they had a dope impression where were you in admiral this whole time oh oh oh well i mean here's here's um moxie here's how you know that it's not trained and i because uh we got the lights fixed at the very end and hafiz said avali just died avali was not at um she was at calm straight and train and i are both out there so therefore it can't be both of us that's right i don't think it can be both of them actually i don't know all right that's one way to lie um now for what i do in this situation the answer is i have no clue i ideally want to kill in an isolated area and then we call something lights are off i don't want to kill her killing her would be terrible train where is this purple where did you just come from i just came from o2 god damn it oh actually no this is fine uh yeah oh it's in camera room uh blastoise i was in o2 uh you ran up to the lights i did not you're okay you were you not opening the doors let me think girls quick promote you were we were in o2 together yeah i did wires and then i actually left and went back to admin side this um this body died before the lights turned off by the way like pretty much right before the lights off okay i mean lazy purple is 100 clear for the first round in my eyes well last night yes ran into lights as i fixed them was someone else with me yeah i was training moxie that fixed the lights no i fixed the lights oh yeah but moxie was in the room i was in there first yeah i saw this okay i saw this die on vitals um it happened pretty much before the lights went out though are you sure you can account for five open train first round i'm not sure i can why should i have i have i have a hunch on something blaster because if that's the case then i was the only person i did i did so here's my paddling this time of the game trains when we go into space i've been in space i'm literally coming out of med bay right now okay so i i went i went and did i went into node uh moxie was with me then i went and did wires moxie is also with me in o2 i left o2 went to admin vitals area i have a hunch and max i'm so sorry if i'm wrong i think moxie's honeydecking me man god damn it dude okay listen last voice you know i couldn't have killed yellow you know uh scotch couldn't have killed yellow if if i was accounting for train you're saying five have been trained accounted for the first round uh we have to vote all right i'm still voting talia she had enough sauce on me in the beginning though that's my issue it was voted all right i'm not going to touch the door two one good job all right i gotta start trusting my feelings real quick honestly i think that was really well played and moxie the only reason i even slightly agreed with you was because of the possibility of it being the two of them but like honestly all of the things i saw in the game didn't point to them well like like that was a good play from them because yeah i had a spicy life yeah i knew that uh scars was good and blastoise was probably good i just needed to know if if five up was telling the truth about the first round and then it couldn't have been trained or five of that killed well we both did lights the body just wasn't killed right then is the thing i think the really good kill is actually on hafu just because i actually need hafu alive for one more round to be able to discuss what was going on i just didn't have info from the first round which was really good thank you for gifting uh five years down this path before with you if i have a hunch it's you i'm just gonna push and i'm sorry if it's wrong because i actually thought it was five of train based on something you said but then i'm like no i'm just scared of five up that's why i think this yeah it happens from now on i have to trust it and what's sick is that the last time i did that with you i voted you off when you were a crewmate for the first time so i mean thank you that's variety thanks make it fun right every time would it be fun that's true exactly what you even want to play foreign
