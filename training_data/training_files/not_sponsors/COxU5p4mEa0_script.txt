I can't believe that landscape
photography is so fun and so frustrating all at the same time After the collaboration I did with Paul
G Johnson the other week someone eagle-eyed noticed that I was using the
Canon 17-40mm f/4 lens and they asked me why I'm using that lens as if
it's not very good lens they're asking me why I'm not using the Canon 16-35 F/4 IS lens
claiming it was sharper better newer lens it just got me thinking is it I
don't know does the lens matter? does the glass you
use matter? so not being wanted to turn down a challenge I've gone ahead and I
have bought the 16-35mm partly to prove to myself whether or not
it's worth it and to help you out as well so what I want to decide today is
is this 16-35mm newer lens better than this older lens and if so
how much and is it worth it so that's what I'm going to do here today in the
absolutely stunningly beautiful Yorkshire Dales Squarespace so we're still doing some
landscape photography today and I am set up for my first shot of the day the way
I'm gonna do it is by like I have here getting the camera set up on the tripod
and then shoot it with one lens don't change any settings or position or
anything else switch the lenses and then take it with
the second shot so for the first shot my composition is pretty much what I've got
behind me this is Ribblehead viaduct I've got this absolutely stunning
limestone pavement down here and just the natural lines just lead you into the
viaduct and you've got the mountain over there which is currently residing in the
sunlight for this shot though what I want is to have some of that sunlight
that's currently on the mountains over there I want that to be striking this
pavement because it just lights it up and creates a much more interesting shot
without that the shot isn't gonna work as well I'll still be able to get
something to do the test but I really want the light to hit it at the moment
we've got the bank of cloud behind me I think it is about to clear
it's definitely forecast to towards the end of the day so it should be quite
exciting the reason I've come here because for this test I wanted to have
some really strong foreground interest to really put the lens to the test
across the frame from the front edge in the corners and then to the background
as well so this shot is going to do that for me I think I'm then going to look
around and try and find his second shot so we've got two shots to compare so we
know one of them wasn't a fluke yeah I just think this is gonna be really nice
shot the reason I've got the camera in quite a precarious position on these
rocks here is because I've gotten really really wide to fill that foreground with
these rocks I'm at 16 millimetres on this one actually I've got into about 17
so it's a fair test because I want 17 millimeters for both shots and it's
filling the foreground with these rocks and they're dominating the frame and then
that just leads you up really nicely to the bridge and then to the sky above it
which has some quite interesting clouds in it as it starts to warm up towards
the end of the evening settings wise I'm an f-16 because I'm really close to
these rocks I want to keep them in focus as much as I possibly can I'm not going
to focus stack or anything that like that
because it's gonna make this shot much more complicated I want it to be
straightforward there's no filters on the front so I can just switch the
lenses out really easily without affecting anything other than the change
of lens so I'm trying to make the test as accurate as I possibly can so I think
we're there now for that first shot it's just a case of climbing up on to here and
pretty much just waiting for those clouds are clear so we can we can grab this
shot I can't believe that landscape
photography is so fun and so frustrating all at the same time the cloud was there
and it eventually cleared just as the Sun started going down behind Whernside
Mountain over there and just unbelievable I've been here for a while
waiting for it and then just as it happened I had about 10 to 20 seconds to
capture the shot I think I got a bit of light on the rocks with both lenses but
it was frantic and it's now spoiled my second shot because and I don't have any
light on the pavement here but the things I'm looking for in this test and
the qualities I look for in a good lens are sharpness firstly is the lens sharp
secondly I want to know especially at these wide angles that were dealing with
today what level of distortion do we get then I'm looking at things like
chromatic aberration and lens flare the Canon 17-40mm lens has always done
me right so I'm very happy with that lens so I really am looking to see a
good improvement with this 16-35mm so I'm set for the second shot now and
without the light on these rocks it's nowhere near gonna be as good but it
still should be I'm really happy with the composition it's still gonna be good
and it's still gonna make this test very very valid very frustrating though I
don't have the light, it's the summer solstice today longest day of the year and the light has dipped behind that mountain a lot sooner than it does in the winter. The sun sets over there
in the winter you get it a lot longer so a bit disappointing but there we go
anyway for this shot the sandstone pavement it's a bit more solid here and
these veins of rock are just fantastic I've looked all around to find veins of
rock that lead you towards the mountain in the background there which is still
bathed in that absolutely remarkable beautiful summer solstice afternoon
Sun. Very simply I've gone to about 31 32 millimetres on this one a bit further
in to test it at different focal lengths but I'm still similar to the last shot
filling the foreground with this rock and then that just leads you up towards
Ingleborough in the background there so that's what I'm going for settings wise
I'm at f/16 again because the limestone pavement is very close I am at a shutter
speed of one eighth of a second I'm just trying to keep this reedy reedy grass
out of the shot because at one eighth of a second that would show some movement
so I've zoomed in a little bit as well to get rid of that iso 100 and that's it
right let's swap the lenses and see what the 17-40 can do. so an absolutely brilliant evening of
landscape photography there. It was very exciting you spend all the time setting
up and waiting and then it happens in such a minute amount of time it was just
it was fun though anyway I've got two good compositions in the bag I've tested
both compositions with both lenses so i'm excited to find out which one's gonna
be best not even sure which are which one I want to win. The 16-35 I'd like to
think lenses can keep getting better I've spent about Â£700 on that lens
the Canon 17-40 you can now pick up for about 200 pounds secondhand that's done
me well for years so I kind of want that one to win because then I can just send
the Canon 16-35mm back and you'd be happy with what I already had so either way
it's exciting I love mucking around with the gear like this and I hope you do too. So late night last night I'm back in the office today I put those pictures into
Lightroom edited them exactly the same for both of these lenses so we can see
which one of these two is going to be the best let's get into the computer and
have a look okay so I've got the images here in Lightroom I've got the two
compositions with the two lenses the green one is from the 16-35 the blue one
is from the 17-40 so let's have a look at the first image to start off
with we can see it's a pretty decent image and that light did eventually come
around not wholly though you can see here in this area here there is a cloud
which is kind of keeping all the light off the viaduct which is what I would
really wanted to make this a top notch shot the light on the rocks is really
nice but if we spin over to the 17-40 picture you can see that light was so
fleeting so if we go back to the 16 to 35 picture let's just zoom in down in on
this corner and have a look at the distortion now distortion is pretty well
handled with this lens I've got to say I'm quite impressed it's nice and sharp
as well if we spin over to the 17 to 40 you can see that distortion is a little
bit worse you can see that stretches this rock here stretches out a lot more
than this one does here so you can see distortion is a little bit better on the
16 to 35 one of the big differences have noticed with this picture is how
the 16 to 35 millimeter handles chromatic aberration much better than
the 17 to 40 so 16 to 35 here barely any chromatic aberration whatsoever which is
nice and there's no correction done in Lightroom either if we spin over to the
17-40 you can see this chromatic aberration appears but especially this
green stuff around the edge of this rock here spin back to the 16 to 35 and that
is gone so that's quite a nice upgrade to the 16
to 35 which I'm really pleased with let's have a look at the next picture
which is a bit more of a straight up comparison so that is the 16 to 35
millimeter that is the 17-40mm and there is just barely any difference the
processing I've done on these pictures is exactly the same I've just done it on
one and then copied it across to the other with this picture the light was
the same as well so it's a really good comparison and you can see the first one
the 16-35mm is slightly more contrasty I think camera settings are exactly the
same and it's just a little bit more contrasty which i think is quite nice
it's also got a slightly warmer tone to it white balance is the same for both
but again we're really talking small things here let's get them close onto
these rocks to have another look at the sharpness.It's the rocks
I'm really looking at because they're completely stationary it's nice and
sharp with the Canon 16-35 let's spin over to the 17-40 and really I'm in
pretty close there I can't really see any difference whatsoever I almost
forgot to mention that I printed the second out with both lenses I have the
prints here that is with the 16-35 that's with the 17-40 the differences
are probably even less in the print because prints can be very forgiving
anyway and these two look very very similar again I think the Canon 16-35 is
very very slightly better it's got slightly more contrast in again
it's got a slightly warmer tone comes through in the print so interesting to see
those results so overall which one is best almost certainly the 16-35
millimeter lens is a better lens but it's so so marginal the build quality is
the same the filter thread size is the same the sharpness is pretty much the
same you're getting better chromatic aberration control of the 16 to 35
better distortion control as well which is good
focusing seemed to be identical on both of them as well and it's just so
marginal 600 to 700 pounds versus about 300 pounds
secondhand so it's really just down to you to decide whether the upgrade is
worth it I think I'm going to keep the 16 to 35 it is a slight upgrade plus it
has the image stabilization image stabilization is important to me not
in stills but I use it a lot for video so that's the reason I'm going to hang on
to that so I'll have one final look at I hope you've enjoyed the video please subscribe if you haven't done so
already I'll see you on another one very very soon I'm Adam this is first man
photography Out!!
