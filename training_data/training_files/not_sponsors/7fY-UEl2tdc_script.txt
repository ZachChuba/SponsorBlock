enough flexing arm emoji blushing emoji 100 emoji we'll check your DMS lots of lettuce I just sent you a message what just happened Alison I'm not trying to discourage anyone from posting pictures of their life for their journey or from trying to inspire other people through documenting their own triumphs right and I do this in jest of course and you probably think about Leon a lot of these people aren't even influencers leave them alone what are you doing and this is what I have to say to that okay the second you put a 30 hashtag garbage fire in the comments of your poster on the post itself that tells me that you want to be discovered right you're putting that 30 hashtag nonsense on your post because you probably downloaded a 999 PDF on how to grow on Instagram and say you just copy and paste it on every post and that tells me that tells me that you want to be discovered you want to find that extra like the help make you feel better right and in doing so you just got discovered by the tomato mafia and this is this is what happens I don't speak Russian so this is difficult I do speak fits patient hashtag though just how I found this thank you Christ because I'm looking at this and I'm thinking to myself I've been working out all wrong you're exactly what we are looking for click our link in my bio to get you featured and be our athlete haha damn Instagram comments life is a journey not a destination be who you want to be not what others want to see I gotta say King's blood really has this game on lock you just tilt the head a bit stare longingly at yourself on your phone as you try and frame your picture in the mirror snap that shot and then come up with some [ __ ] generic quote for the caption and your money baby Instagram really is the perfect vehicle for narcissism is it not I mean as I sit here there are thousands and thousands of people around the world right now at this moment trying to frame the perfect selfie that they're gonna upload to their account and pray to God that they get more likes on this one than they did the last one it's just such a weird it's just such a weird thing look I'm part of it I'm not immune to the desire for likes and views to help me feel nice right I think everybody has that part of them that that feels good when they're noticed it's part of the human condition everybody just wants to be noticed and social media has given us an opportunity to do that in a way that has never before been done previous to the last 10 and 15 years and it's like human psychology I don't think is caught up to a that's why everyone's [ __ ] depressed all the time Wow another girl on a gym bent over in yoga pants groundbreaking content if I had to sum up the fitness demo on Instagram it would just be girls in yoga pants doing squats or bent over rows set to shitty pop music sure they all have like 40 million followers and make truckloads of money but I'm just saying you know dudes us dudes simple creatures right you bend over in yoga pants you're gonna get a like it's as simple as that I mean the reality is if you look at the comments section and some of these female fitness influencers their demographic is like 3% people that are there for some workout tips and then 97% just thirsty ass dudes but hey it's a thriving economy and they're cleaning up some more power to them okay wheels on that those are some impressive gains oh my god finally I'm starting to feel a little bit fit spired here because those three trunks are making me feel like a little baby boy right now hold on a second I need to do myself

fun here with the with the hashtag I just I can't stand putting 30 hashtags on an Instagram post like spamming every single one of your uploads with with hashtags but that's like that's what every social media expert tells you to do right if you want to grow your Instagram just put 30 relevant hashtags and all the posts like don't worry about the content whether or not the content sucks ass or not just make sure you put 30 hashtags on it and you'll definitely be an influencer overnight problem oh hell yeah black and white picture of you Jesus peace that's dope you know the funny part actually as some of you already know this but years ago way before any of this I was like trying to be a social media expert because I had no self awareness at the time and I'm pretty sure I made a video that actually suggested you know using 30 hashtags on all your posts in order to find your audience right so it's just hey guys welcome to another video today we're gonna revisit Instagram hash tagging and how my strategy has evolved over the months a little bit we've really come full circle now to where like I look back at that and I look at it and it makes me want to throw up but you know
