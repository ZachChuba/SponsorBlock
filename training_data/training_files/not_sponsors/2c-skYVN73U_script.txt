see I'm trying to leave the gamer sups visible in the background but the mic blocks it so just know that it's there hello everybody and welcome to the finale of my predator Chronicles series that I started over three years ago two dozen episodes approximately seven hours of content resulting in nearly 30 million views altogether and I threw that all the way to put it on the second channel what a [ __ ] idiot Chris why couldn't you have hired better help is it because like better help you decided to be a [ __ ] scam I'm over it I just haven't addressed it on camera as much as I'd like to disappointing but all great things must come to an end today we are visiting the second half of the investigation in Murphy Texas now I specifically left this portion as the finale because like many things in recent history that are to catch a predator related it ends in tragedy I will be ending the video on that somber note and discuss it from there let me just save you guys the time oh well did you decide to have a pedostache for the finale or what you gonna be one of the guys on the sting you look like this guy who was on the show and this guy do what he's already said the pedophile thing come on brother and I guess since this is the finale Oh nearly man this hat looks like [ __ ] don't mess Murphy now Murphy Texas was interesting because some authority figures and even some locals did not want these people they're not the Predators dateline because Chris and company have always carried a bit of controversy with them everywhere they went and ironically this investigation made it a thousand times worse bad decisions poor police work and get this by the end of it all prosecutors did not pursue charges for any of the Predators caught in that sting instead NBC got sued for a hundred and five million dollars so I guess let's just get into the episode and goof on these innocent men ones have a seat these are [Music] now it's very possible that I just haven't watched it to catch a predator segment in a while but the introduction for this the attention grabber if you will this is very reality show esque there's rock music blast seen as they preface all the predators and they even try to draw you in with the district attorney who offs himself at the end it's all very logan polish and i'm not sure how i feel about it online he made a date with a girl posing as a 14 year old come on Karine I have drinks and soda and some Halloween candy but he appears to get spooked yeah that laugh would have scared the [ __ ] out of me too and that 13 year old really sounded like quite the host come on Karine I have drinks and soda and some Halloween candy but he appears to get speaked yes sorry Popeyes has tweeted out that the chicken sandwich is back I've been wanting to try it so I'll be back in like an hour or something like that our first predator in line is Chris C 1983 are you scared to lose your virginity probably a little I guess can I take it I'll be gentle look at this bulky [ __ ] earthworm nothing about this picture says gentle I cannot believe that they let this creep get within a foot of her what what are you doing here tonight Chris in this big old house with a teenager hiding in a back room looking like a Russian trafficker I think I'm the least suspicious here he doesn't spend too much time with Chris so he bolts until he realizes he's screwed he sent over to be interrogated and he promises that nothing would have happened even if she showed up naked to the door no chance says he would have just went into shock instead I probably would have went into shock and fell over honestly I mean like me I've talked about it and talked about it and then seen breasts and just completely blush and just freeze up I'll be honest a lot of the times I see breasts I freeze up too and that's when you just need a jacket jagged it's cold you know I missed making jokes in this series what did y'all talk about doing having sex really yes sir what else did you talk about gamer's ups now this is incredible for all the wrong reasons imagine staring down the barrel of potential years of prison and every [ __ ] that comes along with it and you later discover that you're getting off scot-free because of the amateurism behind your arrest [Music] you're free now [Music] our next predator in line is sunset liquid online he calls himself sunset liquid and Tony looks like you look like a failed magician you look like a busboy going to his first audition you look like a BuzzFeed reporter you look like an innocent man he shows up to the house and the decoy gives them the usual spiel [Music] you have no water how ironic is this we're trying to form a spark in Flint you drank it all you [ __ ] will that's not a fat joke that's a whale joke whales taking a lot of water so hold on to your hashtags and kpop fan cams not today [ __ ] but a lot of you douchebags in the first part of the investigation we're mentioning the decoys wait and I don't get how you guys just don't understand that everything's bigger in Texas now that was a fat joke but I can make that joke because I'm fat that's how it works right after a long drive needs to go to the bathroom do you want to sit down you're tired right no where do you piss this is a [ __ ] mansion you're telling me all five bathrooms don't work is this supposed to lead to something kinky are you the toilet seriously though you told me you drank all the water where is that all going did you scarf down the septic tank - you got no Dasani you got no toilet the closest thing you got the water is pool Chris why are you taking so long to come out she's taking slugs right now other times you reveal yourself within seconds I don't get what influences your timing are you purposely letting her crash and burn for the content interesting hey sir I need to talk to you for a minute please come on over here nothing up this sleeve nothing up this sleeve come on guys this magician days are behind him he's got a little top hat no magic wand no hair which is also how he likes his girls much like him innocent here you say that you want to perform all sex on her that's touching by the way I want to lick it though so at this point I've heard this excuse a few times but I've never really addressed it it's all fantasy I would never do it I'm just dipping my toe in la-la-land which okay you're still bringing a minor into it one way or another it's kind of like me planning to murder somebody fantasizing about it showing up to their house with a gun and then deciding you know what I don't want to do this now whether what I just did was illegal or not something is wrong immediately throw me back into society may not be the smartest choice place on the ground and just like that his dreams of being cuckolded top seller crumble before him but as I've mentioned multiple times already we ended up watching his charges disappear and he's been going hard ever since I actually bought this set off him last week and just like the fine gentleman I'm covering today please keep these away from your kids our next predator in line is mighty boy here we are back with debatably the best decoy actor on the show Knowles asked the decoy to show his private parts on a webcam at first he asks to see his chest and stomach does this guy commit to his role or what obviously that picture that was pretty hot none of that no bathroom [ __ ] none of that me my mommy and my daddy [ __ ] he does not break character so do you think I should I genuinely believe he wants to [ __ ] this guy whose name is probably earnest then he sends the decoy a picture of his own genitals oh my god that's hot can I see yours please I showed you my dick please respond this guy doesn't show too much remorse really any at all really glad he was let back into society so soon his defense incriminates him more than anything because he says he meets people of all ages he sends everybody his dick and why don't you come here tonight I was gonna play pool actually let's play pool yeah what kind of pool game would you use this for why would you send it to someone who said they were 13 year old boy imagine this guy with a snapchat streaks team he ever watch television this you ever watch Dateline NBC yes so you know what's going on here right how many times have you seen the program advance do you like the show would you recommend it for the people watching at home probably do you know that I have ten Emmys no well T's read his rights and apparently is done talking I'm just waiting for your hairline looks like V Atari logo are you the last airbender this guy just walks right in and somehow doesn't think that was a hobo who just happened to wander in the open door before him hey I don't see any red flags here she's just really cold 13 year old colorblind online using the screen name earthshine 66 the 40 year old chats with a decoy named Tori's got a story the decoy says she's a 13 year old virgin he tells her he has a picture of his genitals and says he wouldn't know what to do with it yeah yeah we tried to keep it that way got some of my leftover Halloween candy Thank You Tory in Hollands Point listen I'm not trying my videos or some [ __ ] well he admits to sending the picture of his private parts he insists he wasn't going to do anything sexual I have a daughter of 13 that never fails to make me feel uncomfortable I do have a child the same age of the one I'm attempting to molest does that give me any brownie points so did you uh why don't you spending some time with your daughter whose decisions also she's having a worse time than you I can make that joke I lived in Wisconsin how would you feel if up in Wisconsin an adult man came to visit your 13 year old daughter what how is that your first response to that now what if a 40 year old mate your 13 year old daughter home alone in Wisconsin well I'd hope he's honest or Aaron Rodgers he decides ahead out and he gives the cops a blip now yes I'm under arrest huh huh it's kind of funny isn't it Chris went from having someone else enforce takedowns why stood idly by to having someone else enforce takedowns why he stood idly by history repeats itself ladies and gentlemen this man has been charged with second and fourth degree sexual assault in the past and here he is reoffending but I guess we got to catch him a fourth time now nice one guys so we let a couple guys free whatever I'm sure none of them will reaffirm luck one of them reoffended well at least he's in prison now I'm just glad none of them returned the jobs where they had a lot of contact with children one of them's a teacher and was able to substitute at multiple schools because he technically didn't have a record this investigation was a [ __ ] show boys and on top of that unfortunately no one else had an interview with Chris because Chris left the sting house but before that I guess the only person worth mentioning is the man known as twink toilet which is a very literal name because he wants twinks to excrete waste on him and here's his defense for being there he cannot believe I did this well my best friend Swann was dying of cancer it's not a real excuse for it but I wasn't in my right mind so what did the oncologist say they said she's Stage four [ __ ] I'm really sorry man I know it's [Music] it's so hard for you bro a bad dog so I guess we can talk about Lewis Conrad now there is so much information on this and at the same time so little I'm not gonna be able to tell you everything in this video but let me explain to the best of my knowledge what happened Lewis was an assistant district attorney in Terrell Texas and he was one of the men that chat up one of the decoys from perverted justice after multiple background checks chatting and even phone calls PJ determined that yes this was without a doubt the assistant district attorney from Terrell Texas however he never showed up to the house even after he said he would and usually when a potential predator does not show up he is still arrested because you don't need to show up to break the law when soliciting a minor but for Lewis they kick things into hyperdrive to arrest him in his home now PJ will tell you it was because Lewis had suddenly stopped chatting with the decoy at one point and then they notice he deleted his myspace page so they figured he was starting to get rid of evidence so they wanted to get to him before he wiped everything clean however there was missing and contradicting information when that myspace page was later brought up so they left the sting house and made their way to his home and Chris was there bright and early they were stalking comrads house the entire morning to speak to him the second he left but he never did Chris and company were working closely with Murphy's chief of police as well as one of his lieutenants they also seem to be very pushy with the process people later claiming that their actions and rash decisions were influenced by the cameras apparently it was said that the chief told several officers that he hoped Dateline will put Murphy on the map and it definitely did so they rushed an arrest and search warrant that had airs all over it because a sleep-deprived officer wrote them up to have them ready that morning and after they were signed off by a judge they had the green light to act they decided to contact Tarot's local police department to get involved and after Lewis did not answer the door multiple times they called an attack team to force their way in and after several time passed and plenty of deliberation the TAC team came in through a slide door and saw Lewis at the end of the hallway beginning to put his hands up but they also noticed something shiny in his hand his final words were something along the lines of I don't want to hurt anybody and he turned the pistol on himself NBC was later sued by Louis's sister for a hundred and five million dollars and NBC originally said her case had no merit but once a judge allowed the case to be heard by a jury NBC settled out of court with her for an undisclosed amount and there's a lot more to this story that I am leaving out it will take [ __ ] forever if I try and tell you everything I think if you want the most information you can read this piece from Esquire that I've linked below it's an awfully long read but it breaks it down piece by piece and although to catch a predator did not end immediately after this situation it was said to be one of the bigger reasons why the show was later cancelled some people looked at this situation and said good riddance another pedophile dealt with other people looked at the situation and blamed PJ Chris NBC and/or the police in charge for this man's death authority figures in Texas did not support the actions being taken during the scenario it all came off as a plot for ratings it all came off as a plan for the spotlight the big catch and now never know a hundred percent of the story but after reading all I could on this topic I have to agree the decisions made by these people that were most likely influenced by not just the law itself led to this guy off in himself now am I gonna show deep sympathy because a potential predator offed himself no obviously this is something easy to brush off he unfortunately took his own life but in life he was saying [ __ ] like this to underage children and had he not turned the gun on himself most people would be saying lock him up and throw away the key which is a death sentence of its own it's just something that didn't need to happen I agree that some people there had different intentions when proceeding with this operation I'm curious what you guys think I'm curious if you change your mind after reading that piece from Esquire the whole situation was just [ __ ] up but regardless of all of that I still stand by my opinion that at the end of the day to catch a predator did more good than it did bad significantly I just realized they look like a train operator I don't even look like a cop it is a series that is still relevant to this day not only in meme culture but just in general to catch a predator is notorious regardless of my feelings towards Chris at this point the show would not have been the same without him so to keep it short and sweet here's to the finale these are the predator Chronicles and that is actually gonna be the end of not only this episode but the series I know you're gonna ask if Chris comes out with more investigations will I cover them I don't want to but if it's you know a Content goldmine I'll throw it on the second channel along with every other episode but only if it is a Content goldmine if it's just some [ __ ] made I'm good that's all so if it ever comes out anyways all the predator Chronicle episodes have been moved to my second channel mr. G dubs the one you are watching right now they are in a playlist for your viewing pleasure I've also kind of thought about this if you care kind of reacting to the episodes in the series because I have not rewatched any episode in at least like two years so I don't remember a lot of the things I did you guys let me know if you want me to make that a thing anyways if you enjoyed this video please leave it alike and subscribe to my second channel because I have more content coming your way code message easy on one word as always I am your host mr.
