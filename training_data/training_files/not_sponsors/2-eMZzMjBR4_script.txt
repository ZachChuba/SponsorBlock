when you reviewed as many laptops as I have getting excited about a new machine can be difficult to say the least like take the latest Asus zephyrus the engineering that went into making something that powerful that slim is seriously impressive and yet the Zephyrs just doesn't turn me on but looking at the new Alienware area 51 M I have an 85 percent IRR [Music] [Music] now eight and a half pounds the area 51 M doesn't care about you your back your ears or even your dog but all it cares about is insane gaming performance but can a laptop no matter how big really tangle with the desktop let's find out after you find about glasswire instantly see your current and past network activity detect malware and block badly behaving apps on your PC or Android device use offer code Linus to get 25% off glasswire 2.0 at the link below with our model coming in a $4,500 the Alienware area 51 m is one serious piece of kit and it feels like it too the magnesium chassis has to be one of the most rigid I've ever felt like there's absolutely no flex and opening the screen just it just feels so good it also has a strong assortment of i/o with the highlights being Thunderbolt three multiple display outs and my personal favorite a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port maybe the most interesting hole though is the power connector or should I say connectors this power brick alone just this one right here weighs a quarter pound more than the service laptop itself and it's not even the only one there's two power bricks and together they pump out over 500 watts now why do we need all that power well Dell hasn't just put laptop parts in here that's that's just garbage they've put in a full fat desktop grade until Core I $9.99 hundred K as paired pleasantly with an NVIDIA RTX 20 80 32 gigabytes of RAM and 2 terabytes of storage now all of this computing power is delivered to your eyeballs through a hundred and forty-four Hertz 1080p IPS display with HDR and gsync there is a 60 Hertz version but just don't buy that one because this one right here is awesome - game on I do kind of wish they had a 1440p version but they couldn't do it with a smaller bezel so oh well and it's not like the 1080p panel here is hard to look at we also have damn-near desktop level upgrade ability removing the bottom gives you access to four sodium's slots for the RAM the MDOT two slots and a 2.5 inch drive Bay delving deeper UPS difficulty a bit but thankfully a lemur has created videos showing how to properly take this machine apart along with convenient guidelines here on the ribcage showing just how many screws need to come out and hopefully go back in after removing the battery the back shroud thing and a couple of ribbon cables we can see the real meat of the beast like look at this cooling they've got six massive heat pipes spreading the load around four heat sinks all with these two chunky fans just chunky mean James put that in there apparently it's cool we need all of that del wasn't lying when they said this is a desktop processor so if you didn't get the 9900 K from the factory you'll have no problem just plopping one in and assuming the standards don't change too much the GPU should be upgradeable to like to be clear this isn't a standard desktop GPU it's kind of like a spiritual successor to MXM developed in-house by Dell but with any luck this will be upgradable to an RT X 21 Series or whatever Nvidia decides to call it next but with all this desktop grade hardware and such a small package like relatively speaking compared to just a desktop was Alienware able to bend the laws of thermodynamics and really deliver that full desktop performance well not quite but they did get damn close although the area 51 M just losing basically every test that we threw out it compared to the MSI Triton X it didn't fall very far behind like it's pretty much within the margin of error and it absolutely destroys every laptop we've ever tested in CPU tests the i9 9900 K absolutely shreds the Asus GX 701 and like even with that having a blowing with Tron strapped to it and also comfortably outpaces the AMD 2700 in the Acer Helios 500 as for GPU performance well we just published a video titled the fastest gaming laptop we've ever tested both the Zephyrus and the area 51 M is just whooping it like this thing is a cell of 15 percent faster in 3d mark and even better in games like the processor holy crap this thing is fast it's just like any frame yeah I know it's really great ok we know it's powerful but have you been telling the viewers the whole story - yes so when you got those test result it's how hot exactly was the processor a a hundred degrees uh-huh and how fast were the fan spinning but at max all right all right get out of here listen I got something to say all right I'm gonna tell you what the area 51 M is actually like to live with so first of all going anywhere with it is basically a fool's errand like it's got not one but two power brakes and like Alex said this one here alone weighs a quarter pound more than the surface laptop and you need these bricks it does have a 90 watt hour battery close to the maximum allowed on a plane so they can't exactly make it bigger but with power-hungry components like we have here you'll be lucky to stay away from the wall for more than two and a half hours then there's the performance mode which just literally pins the fans all the time which is great for performance but it's really loud meaning you'll be regularly going to the control center between tasks to pick your poison lower performance or super noisiness and speaking of noise that's pretty much the only thing these speakers make like they get loud but above about 50% volume the whole thing just becomes a muddled mess which is particularly annoying since Alienware has traditionally had awesome speakers another thing that area 51 M boasts is Toby eye-tracking a technology that tracks where your eyes are looking on the screen to occasionally do cool things but mostly to do literally nothing due to poor support in games and to be clear I don't want to put down having this as a feature but it's just unfortunate that despite this laptop having IR and eye tracking that it also doesn't support Windows hello facial recognition for faster unlocking or even just a simple fingerprint scanner this is the kind of thing that should just be here on a laptop that's this expensive and will make everyday use just that much more smooth although at least they did manage to fit it with a half decent webcam unlike the trackpad which is just a big load of suck not using windows precision drivers gives it that synaptics drunken driver feel hmm and even despite its small size I've still had some palm rejection issues I do appreciate the two dedicated buttons and the glass top feels nice but bad scrolling mediocre gesture support and subpar tracking all mean a real mouse will definitely be your friend while using the area 51 m and the keyboard don't get me started the lighting on these secondary keys would not pass razors QA but I do have to give Alienware some real credit for this keyboard in general the strokes are surprisingly long and although tactile also very smooth of all the gaming laptops on the market Alienware might have the best keyboards easily beating razer msi and even a soos exactly it is awesome not as a laptop maybe but as a desktop replacement and that's what this actually is so the real question is should you buy one well honestly it was my $4,500 as much as I think the area 51 M is really cool I just get a desktop and a surface laptop but I say that having the luxury of a good place to put a desktop and lots of people just don't maybe you're a co-op student who get whisked off way to any city with little notice or someone who travels a lot for business or just generally don't have the space or stability for a full desktop setup so if that's you and you have loads of cash to throw down and the earth doin em is going to make you feel like a badass every time you open it up and speaking of a badass when you open 4 slash Lynas today so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome get subscribed hit that like button or check out the link to where to buy the stuff we featured in the video description also linked in the description is our merch store which has cool shirts not like this one but Riley also didn't have one on whatever and join our community forum which you should join
