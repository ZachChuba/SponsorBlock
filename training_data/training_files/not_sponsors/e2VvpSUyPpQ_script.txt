so we have a great video for you guys today actually we have no idea if it's going to be a great video because as you can clearly tell our mizu 16th not to be confused with the me zoo 16. i i think that is what this is this is no no i and it's just funny because they put 16 anyway it's not the 15th our mizu 16th is clearly still shrink-wrapped but we were intrigued by this phone because on the product page for it it claims to be water-cooled and it's not the only phone to claim that so what the crap exactly is water cooling in phones can we can we investigate that by perhaps taking it apart we sure think so but we've been known to make mistakes from time to time this is probably a bad idea speaking of use offer code linus to get 25 off at the link below so step number one would be to open the package yeah i mean what else is cool about this phone do you know what else is cool about that i actually don't know anything about this phone why did we even pick this phone so it's got a snapdragon 845 yeah so it's pretty flagship we got eight gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage there's a six inch screen 3000 milliamp hour battery and an in screen fingerprint sensor oh that's cool that is pretty cool what other phones have that other than the vivo is there anything even yeah oneplus oh really yeah the 16. so it feels pretty phony that is to say that it's genuine but like a phone oh to get a complete fingerprint please peel the plastic film off so apparently their skin is called fly me i've actually never used a meizu mizu meizu phone before apparently there is lineage os for it so oh that's pretty cool okay you're really not helping it feels pretty uh like kind of one plus sixty actually how do we really how do you even use i don't android no even sound espanol are we spanish no oh geez louise well let's see what else is in this this here box while he's taking this hey dual sim what do you have well bam a charger look at that wow that is a big charger what is it is there another case we get two cases we got two cases what the heck really did the camera die so while brandon fixes the camera i'm going to go ahead and enroll my fingerprint this is significantly slower than the oneplus 6t one like it says i see that it lights up under your finger yeah i guess congrats the setting is completed yeah all right apps you can't miss oh we better get snapchat i want zender file that looks pretty clean yeah let's see what about the settings what the heck that looks very iphoney what about the camera i've seen worse it's a little bit cool what okay hold on i gotta go landscape for that terrible okay yeah it's it's not great it's kind of lifeless you know like pasty and really white i might just be basically what now we do the autopsy we might have a what the kids would describe as a bad freaking time you're not i wouldn't know that because i'm a kid you're not old enough to do the like as the kids would say no that's the whole joke though so this just looks like what we're just i say we try and take the back off you want to go back well look at the screen it doesn't look like that's the thing that separates i bet it does let's take the back off what is this this is a fingerprint scanner i don't know what the crap that is it is a ring flash wow you have some huge pores sorry anyways [Music] gosh power off you're going to hold the big thing and i'm going to stick it in okay the the guitar pick what are you how are you going to get it in let me just kind of lick my finger here okay that's pretty high there is um not much of a gap there right yeah we might need more heat penetrated properly oh it is it's cooling down yeah it's cooling down it's fine whoops how is it on again this is not even showing the overheating thing either i'm gonna go get gloves yeah that's a good idea i think he's wrong i think it's screamed first so i'm just gonna pursue that avenue this time why are these all different clubs oh hold up wait wait wait wait wait wait we're penetrated boys oh yes that is hot on my very bare hands oh there we go yep looks like some adhesive oh that's kind of cool holding on to that there wow there's no connections hey nice what is that that looks like whatever it was only like 400 bucks why did you just turn it on no i'm just curious okay making sure we didn't break it or maybe we didn't break it yeah i don't know it seems to be working right this is youtube putting its best foot forward security guard prank satisfying slime death wish dangerous riders seven riddles that will test your brain that was fun so it works and we got it open how are we gonna keep track of where these go i thought we weren't putting this back together why aren't we putting it back together just remember it's fine no i'm not gonna remember and you're not gonna remember they're probably all the same size screws anyway they're probably not why would you say something like that that's such a stupid thing to say there's actually a fairly good we just voided our warranty is there anything under there so yeah wait no because there's the haptic feedback thing so what is this speaker yeah speaker oh those are the buttons oh okay which are those the buttons i don't actually think those are the buttons can you imagine if we opened this up and it actually didn't have water yeah let's got scammed what the hell are they talking about it's got to be the other side okay so what you're saying then is we should have gone in from the screen side i don't know if we can though that might actually don't know if we can we should probably take the battery connector off before we continue yeah we probably should oh wait is this a tab no no look at that be careful they'll bend it too much they thought of that um should we stick long probey things under here no no plastic ones please please ah jake okay i still don't end it that seems fine look at this it's got like extra antennae mounting spots like lots of them fingernail is the proper tool that's what lewis rossman told me is it yeah i don't know it's weird yeah it's like it is oh that's all the symmetry we didn't take the sims right out oh hey look there's the copper thingy that's it no but wait it probably goes underneath yourself that's their water cooling i don't think we have all of it out of there yet it's got to be thin it's a phone that's how that works yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah point four millimeter stick point four millimeters so basically there's our soc um everything else has shields over it so it's actually kind of hard to tell exactly where the storage is if i had to guess i would say nan flash is probably under here or dram looks about that size um but what we're after is the cooler so you can see that's where they've got the thermal compound between of it again is presumably our soc and bad news water cooling solution what is it i don't think we can really get it out of there but we can expose more of it is that a fart yes can we clean up them please fine okay i'll be right back now the kids have gone to bed we can get some serious work done around here nice i feel entirely comfortable being ageist to you because you treat me exactly the same you know what it's just because you're old okay wow he's doing it with metal yikes is that it that's the most we can expose like can we take it apart more i mean do we want to be able to put it back together or you don't care at this point i don't know i want to give the people what they came for we could cut it in half what's inside to start like scratching at it linus rig everything oh wow zack's a cool guy i love what he does he's just better at it than we are so i'm gonna let him do the scratching you know what i don't even care because that you know what that's as deep as we're going because i want to flip this phone on ebay when we're done so basically what is water cooling what is water cooling this dude do you want to go grab a prop for us do you want to go grab like a water cooler oh i was gonna bring a heat sink no jake no you're not watching what what what hey can you go get a water cooler oh yeah yeah no i know you're talking about yeah okay he was going to go get him i kind of need to fart though okay so you want to crack that you don't need a water cooler so basically what you're looking at here is i think calling it a water cooler is a little disingenuous but you actually could make the argument that it's a fluid cooler at the very least because what's happening is we've got a flat base so that allows it to make optimal contact with whatever type of processor whether it's a cpu gpu soc whatever type of processor you're trying to cool and then right under it and it really is actually very impressive how thin they've managed to make this uh this kind of tube shape you might say it's kind of like a pipe yeah it goes down to like helps with the the heat you know and also this aluminum heat sink that it's embedded in it's really really impressive how thin it is but what it is is a heat pipe so it's actually the exact same technology that you would find in what we would traditionally describe as an air cooler you need water cooler sorry i mean water cooler i'm going to start calling them fluid coolers and the reason i'm going to call them that is because the way a heat pipe works is right here okay so first of all these the inside of them is usually at very low pressure like near vacuum and then in the factory you'll always notice at one end of a heat pipe you're going to have a nice clean termination see that and then at the other end you've got kind of this mess where it was crimped off and sealed so that's because these are at very very low pressure so the low pressure affects both the boiling point of the fluid inside and the condensation points what happens is here at the heat source even though the difference in temperature between here and here the fluid because remember both liquids and gases are fluids the fluid will boil which will cause it to go to the end of the tube and then over at the end of the tube where there is a fan blowing air through it to cool it or your hand which is effectively kind of like liquid cooling the phone like because your blood is pumping your blood is liquid anyway it's kind of like an ai oh right yes so the point is that um at the other end where that fluid is then being cooled it turns back into a liquid and then there is usually on the inside either sintering or like some kind of wicking texture to the inside of the heat pipe that causes that liquid to wick back to the point where it's heated up again so you end up with this kind of this flow so is it water cooling not in the way that we would traditionally define water cooling because we've typically referred to this as heat pipe air cooling but there is fluid involved and in some cases heat pipes are actually filled with a fluid that is either completely or mostly water so it's it's possible it's water cooled but i'm gonna call it fluid cooling from now on to be fair they do say water cooling do they really water is in quotes only water so maybe they're like that's fine right the kensington
