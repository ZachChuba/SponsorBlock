all good things come in twos jaws - Garfield - neck - so obviously last of us - was destined to be a masterpiece until the plot got leaked then the internet decided that this game was no good these spoilers basically show you that the game is not worth buying this game is shaping up to be a complete dumpster fire - like people are canceling their pre-orders left and right I won't be buying Last of Us - you have betrayed the fan base I don't even want to [ __ ] play it anymore and it's quite fitting that both halo 5 is [ __ ] and so is Last of Us - it doesn't [ __ ] matter if the game is out or not the story is still [ __ ] and this is why you have to actually play a video game before you start talking all that [ __ ] of course these guys are small potatoes now me I'm the dude off of ratatouille you can get past these guys but the only way to get past me is to put Donkey Kong in the game what sucks about always putting out great stuff is that people come to expect the impossible from you the original Last of Us was a very good game and one that has been very influential on this generation of story driven games however compared to this game it is like a dogs chew toys uncharted 4 took Last of Us and slam dunked it into the [ __ ] garbage cans bigger more interesting story with better acting performance it's better combat music puzzles crash bandicoot and all of these different types of traverse so how do you top uncharted 4 well you don't in that game you get a grandpa hook in Last of Us part 2 you open 150 filing cabinets uncharted is mysterious and exciting with a knockout ending Last of Us is gross and horrific it is a barrage of violence and screaming and cruelty but it's also pretty damn fun Naughty Dog continues to build upon their eye disease comment you can now crawl feed grass set traps trick to zombies into attacking your enemies and headshot people with your silenced pistol this isn't Metal Gear 5 levels of flexibility but it's a far more game-like game than the original levels are massive with tons of branching paths some of the encounters in this game are so sprawling and complicated that they could be tackled in 20 different ways eventually though you are going to get caught enemies can spawn you pretty easily that's when you got to throw a Molotov at somebody and run for cover the less people searching for you the easier it is to slip back into hiding this is why I would often shoot everybody looking for me the combat is [ __ ] brutal when you stab somebody blood squirts out of their neck the shotgun will just destroy someone's entire body we have a bow and arrow that shoots dynasty enemies flying out for their fallen comrades and beg for their lives it's all the protesters go or that people desire from this type of being taken to such a degree where you go Jesus Christ in a stroke of absolute genius they have taken inspiration from the classic game of Rogue Warrior when Ellie kills somebody she'll sometimes call them a swear word dick sleepytime you [ __ ] [ __ ] it can't live up to its mind-blowing III trailer but this is easily one of the best looking games out there the story is heavily reliant on actors and animators alike to bring these characters to life and they do some incredible work we've seen all sorts of US cities and video games New York Boston San Francisco New York Hong Kong Chicago Los Angeles even New York is in some games but it's cool to see a place I'm actually familiar with realized in a game of this caliber siano bye bye bye bye bye bye spam booty hey what the [ __ ] that's supposed to be Cheesecake Factory this game is ruined lizards and thunderstorms tighten the tension sunlight piers two windows of abandoned storefronts trees and currents tear through the city and reinforce imagery of life and beauty slowly rising out of this world of darkness people aren't mad about graphics or gameplay though they're mad about the story so what do I think about story huh you want to know what I think it's a pretty good story I haven't been this engaged by a videogame story since Red Dead 2 and got it for there are some bold twists in here but they're all in service of a story that is still very faithful to the spirit of the original this is a lengthy game that takes its time setting the stage and getting you invested in its characters and then they all start killing each other turns out we got bamboozled you don't play as the giraffe instead you play it as a girl called Abaddon and she kills jewel with a golf club how are you gonna kill off the main guy that's everybody's favorite guy honestly I think Elly should track down this Abby character and tell her see how she likes it now that would be a good storyline the truth is I don't know why people are mad at this game because they don't know why they're mad fans are obviously very attached to Joel as a character and that's why killing him off is such a powerful way to ignite a revenge story I don't know anything about this Abbey person but you [ __ ] kill Joel with both of all sports no way I am coming to shoot this big dumb muscle [ __ ] and that's exactly what Ellie does Mike uncharted Last of Us 2 uses dual narratives to draw parallels in comparisons between its characters though instead of laying them on top of each other they're intersecting Ellie story is uncharted for an a B story is Last of Us one just like nathan drake's obsessive pursuit of treasure Ellie's suicidal revenge mission puts her friend's lives in constant danger and yet she keeps taking it further then halfway through the game everything resets the clock turns back three days and now you play as the belly f who is a hardened killer that starts to reconnect with her lost humanity thanks to the innocence of her child companions sound like anybody you know it's obvious they're going to try and humanize and develop all these characters now looking from the other side and at first you reject them you go [ __ ] these guys I don't care about though they kill Joel with golf except for the dog I like him but as you keep playing eventually you find yourself getting wrapped up in their drama a moment where they really got me was this they fight this battle goes on for so long that it really come to hate [ __ ] sniper but by the time you reach them you realize wait a minute no I really like that guy every side of the story is very focused and simple every side is messy and complicated with a bunch of new characters running around doing crazy [ __ ] in the middle of a war zone it's very entertaining trying to connect the dots between both sides of the story and I imagine there's a lot of details you won't even catch until you go back and play through it again a character you've already encountered as Ellie will show up in the back half of the game you know hey I remember that guy characters will do things he won't agree with and you'll have to turn them rain on an attempt to empathize with them in the world of Last of Us part two one hateful act begets another but a selfless act can also be contagious the story is not as airtight as Joel and Ellie's journey across the United States but conceptually this sequel is far more creative so I give this game a four out of five shut the [ __ ] up leafy
