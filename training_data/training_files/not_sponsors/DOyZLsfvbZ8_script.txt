what's happenin B's and J's and welcome back to another upgrade and unlock episode the series where we unlock to certain chunks of map until we complete certain tasks these are the current chunks that we've unlocked as you join us in episode 2 if you've missed episode 1 click the playlist up in the top right corner or the link in the description I would HIGHLY advise going back to episode 1 because it explains all the rules and how we can unlock new chunks we have just unlocked the alkyd mine and I've also streamlined a couple of things we're now going to be going for every 25 levels just to make the total level a lot easier to track so every 25 levels is going to give us a new chunk i've also massively streamlined how we're going to be doing the chunk so it's way easier to get a fair result out of it now we have quite a problem with opening up that mind yes we can go there and start mining but unfortunately the scorpion's keep attacking me and we need to be level 29 I believe until they'll stop attacking us I mean at the moment all we would be able to do is smell in the furnace with the ores we now should be able to make anything so for now I'm actually gonna leave that out I think we're gonna hop into some wood cutting and fletching that way we can get our next levels and get up to that 1 to 5 to open up a new chunk a boy Bob's gonna be sorting us out for our axes throughout the earth throughout the whole type I'm gonna buy an iron and I'm also gonna buy a steel now this is the last level there we go for a new chunk 125 we can now cut oak trees as well and we have the new streamlined way of choosing our next chunk right here we go guys picking a random chunk I do not want the jewel arena anything left really I'd like something left let's have a look [Music] I guess it unlocks chickens it unlocks chickens other than that it's not great I guess we get the cows now but we're sort of not that bothered about it we get some crafting levels through doing the leather all this there's a farmer there as well actually so we can start pickpocketing oh okay not bad not bad we can't quite get to the farmer unfortunately which would have meant we could we could start that quest but uh not quite there on sheep shearer up but other than that okay it's it's not a bad one so what I'm gonna do is start killing some chickens and obviously use the feathers with this for some extra fletching XP will be picking up the bones and I'll probably cook some of the chicken as we start leaving from the farmer who is just that which is going to be way better thieving XP then taking on the men was so we went ahead and got ourselves some prayer levels some fletching levels some wood cutting levels and we are now back onto the 150 as soon as these go ahead and cook so it means we get to go and open up a new chunk opening up number eight would mean that we could get cooks assistant done which would be amazing so while I'm hoping for an eight we're gonna have a look and see what we get here we got four so we're down here unlocks the yew tree but obviously I'm not gonna bother going for that does unlock ham members which we can thieve because we're gonna got 20-plus thieving I'm probably gonna have to have a look more than anything here the lost city opens up I don't know if we can do that or not I'll look into that as well but uh not much and I also had a really useful comment in the comment section of the last video which said I should buy a rake and I might as well start raking these farming patches for a little bit of farming XP while we can't actually do anything else with the skill now we can definitely start Lost City because I know the second part is over there we just have to talk to the tree but we definitely won't be able to complete it for a while we need to actually unlock in tirana but I'm gonna go ahead and start it just because I don't think I've started any questions all no we haven't started anything so you know what we're gonna go ahead and do that we can't go down into the handler so we will go down there maybe do some pickpocketing do they drop a pot of flour through pickpockets maybe they do not unfortunately but they do drop a few things that will be useful for us so I'm just gonna spend a bit of time here and we'll see how we go okay we got instantly kicked out so I don't know if it's that worth it they just drop a few things that would be useful like some opals or steel pickaxe some of the ham cloaks but other than that nothing too crazy time to return back to alkyd and do a little bit of fishing now in the last episode I was like oh I don't know where I'm gonna get a small fishing net from and about 300 of you decide to tell me that you start with one-off tutorial Island so thank you very much guys I don't know how I missed that but we are gonna go ahead and get probably just go ahead and get 25 fishing to be honest so we can get a new chunk because that chunk we just got absolutely useless a massive trying to get would be number seven here it would be huge because it would mean that we could do cooks assistant and it means we could also do sheep shearer so that would be two quests completed literally just hoping for that one right just grab yourself five fishing I know I said I'd go to 25 but this scorpion keeps ragging me and it is so annoying so I'm not gonna honestly things like that like the scorpion attacking me up by the mining bit I'm just gonna leave those skills until a little bit later on when we do hatch the Apple levels and they're not gonna just auto attack us cuz it just slows everything down massively especially being on the hardcore if I was just on a normal account I'd probably just sit there and take it but on the hardcore definitely definitely not another level coming in there cooking very nice but we do now have the cows we also have our courage so we can turn the cowhide so this seems like a pretty good way of doing it we'll get a few more stats up and melly wise and then we'll go ahead and get our crafting level up through the tanning that is a full Emma tree of Cara Hyde actually we need as much XP as possible it's fun playing like this honestly I'm really ever played an account where I have to just be as frugal as possible with everything we get like even when I get drops I'm not even sure that I'm gonna use them in the future but I pick them up and Bank them because you know you never know things like if I kill an imp and it drops flower if it drops a potted flower say I didn't know I need that power flower for the cooks assistant there's gonna be things in the future where I lost [ __ ] I should have picked that up it is really really fun just being able to send things like that but we are gonna go ahead and handle this cowhide by some thread and a needle over at the crafting store and get ourselves some crafting XP and this big man I'm looking for off [ __ ] what do I need I think it's soft lever yeah we'll have the soft leather please mate all in one I thought you did one at a time see you get to do things that you've never done before trade with my boy one needle and let's buy no twenty thread for now and I think we make gloves to start with don't actually have any so there's an upgrade thank you very much so that inventory got us four and a half just over four and a half so this is gonna be quite a slow process the next thing we unlock is boots at level seven so hopefully we get that on the next inventory but I'm just gonna go back to the cows rinse and repeat that is gonna be enough the else level seven there we go we can now make the boots so let's go ahead and do that I think it is better XP by quite a considerable amount sort of look goes up to 16 yeah not bad at all not bad at all we'll take it we'll take it it was 13 to 14 before so I'll take it there we go guys 175 total level 10 crafting we can now make those strings as well which is interesting when we get some flax we can give that together but it also means a new chunk is unlocked I'm also gonna go ahead and spend the first money or monetary chunk by so thousands we're gonna go ahead and buy a chunk as well cuz I really want to get that seven unlocked for those of you who missed the comment it was a really good comment and I liked it so I can buy my first chunk for a thousand coins the second chunk for ten thousand then a hundred thousand then one mill then ten mill and so on okay so we're gonna take 1k out and we are gonna drop this on the floor and that is our cost to open up the first square then it will be 10k there'll be 100k there'll be one mill ten mill hundred mill one bill and so on they were cheapest buy off the whole thing here we go as I said we are going to be using a thousand GP to open our first monetary chunk and obviously we hit the 175 total which gives us another chunk so two chunks to open here as I say seven would be amazing and be so so so helpful if we could get that it would unlock those two quests ten wouldn't be too bad start on looking drain or I guess getting sort of this area wouldn't be too bad I sort of want to miss all of this out so let's have a look pick our first square okay guess it's up to varrock I guess it gets us close to power up but it doesn't really help anything it's open these two up and see what we're gonna get next it does have wheat but we can't make it into a pot of flour now I don't think that's very helpful where we go next champions guild unlocked but we really do not need that at the bow but but I guess it's unlocked it gets us up towards towards the old varrock and there is that mining spot there which means we can't start mining there's another farming patch so we can break some more weeds other than that it really not helpful we'll add these two into the groove now starting to really open up but still nothing we just may get this little figure out severed hopefully seven has got a massive chance now surely of opening up so I think what I'm gonna go ahead and do is get some we're going and fire-making for the next few levels I think we're just gonna keep hitting total levels until we can open up some quests because there's literally nothing we can do quest wise as of yet I would have hoped we would have been able to do at least one quest by now but it is just sort of forcing us to get some levels which I guess isn't too bad like by the time I know it we're gonna have like forties in certain skills laughs air enough you know it doesn't feel like a massive grind because even though like I don't know doing wood cutting in fire making normally we just feel like oh this is a serious grind there's nothing to but I know there's a reward at the end which makes the skills more fun in a way this is another thing I should have been doing is casting and using all of my runes in the bank and then every 30 minutes going and claiming more from the tutors so I'm just gonna go ahead and absolutely send all of my runes here and we're gonna get some more and that way you know I'm just getting the passive magic because at the moment we have no magic shops it's definitely hard to come by on the on the Bruns and we just need to go ahead and drop those claim thank you very much mate and that is another 30 casts over we can kill this imp I mean it might drop a bead it might drop the flower which would mean we could get a quest done and just a sort of update where we are we're a $1.99 a super coaster next level I think I'm just gonna get it through fire making and of course it drops a chicken which we literally have an abundance of there we go 23 5 making coming in it takes us to 200 total level a new chunk to open up just before we get into that a lot of you were asking you about a CC yeah I do have a CC Lynx ocarina if you'd like to join it let's jump in and see what we're gonna get here guys we are so close to the video as well cheers guys right here we go guys please please please give us seven here we go no desert please no desert that opens up the mining but we've already got some mining up here I guess what you do some mining and smithing there is the quest there I think the boat takes you to a place you can't actually access so I'm going to count that if the boat takes us somewhere but I can't access on the map normally then we will go ahead and use it I mean it definitely does because there's no way to get to that island other than using this transportation and as I said in the previous episode say we unlock I don't know for example the taverley dungeon the whole dungeons gonna be unlocked so just having this square unlocks the whole thing so I guess it means we can go ahead and give ourselves a quest done yeah just looked it up it looks like we are gonna be able to get this done which is awesome so let's talk to Abigail here so yeah guys as you can see when we get to the world map we're technically still here so there's actually no way of accessing this place through the map as you can see so this this quest is definitely gonna be doable which means another map chunk to open up after we're done with this we also get some crafting XP from it which is nice this quest is proper aid [ __ ] it's a free to play quest and it's actually like how on earth would you workout most of this stuff it's absolutely crazy okay I think he's in here I hate this quest I absolutely hate it but how's that not rebounded at him [ __ ] this quest that's core do it that's got do it and you don't do that like four times or something [ __ ] there we go back to backs there we go the first quest ever on the account one quest point a new chunk 600 crafting XP a ruby and emerald and sapphire very nice did we get a level yeah we did get level 12 we now make oil lamps not too useful 202 total and of course a new chunk here we go guys come on come on come on I'm feeling good about this one I should be happy or not I guess it gets us close to the Wizards tower against us close to Porter rim it gets us close to there we got we got the bank we got the willow trees we got the dark wizard so we got the jail can we stop oh can we do Prince alleys rescue maybe possibly we could do that we've got the old man we've got obviously the stores to steal from we could steal from the seed store now Ned for the rope but other than that nothing Elsa don't think so I've actually worked out there's an anvil underneath the jail in Draenor so we can now mind Smith and make stuff at the anvil so you know what I feel like giving it a go we're just gonna go and send it so that's the first inventory and we did get ourselves six mining as well which means we can now use a steel pickaxe so I'm going to go over to the hand guards and pickpocket them try yourselves a steel pickaxe there because it'd be really useful to have that upgrade over the bronze right here we go so I have actually here her brought myself some chicken with me because we've got to go through zombies and the jail guards and you know what I don't feel like dying are they aggressive to us I'm just gonna see if they're aggressive because that will be a yes they are okay there we go so we're gonna go ahead and eat this and then if we go up here the skeletons as well oh god is this guy gonna let us use his anvil that's the question I've got a feeling he isn't because why would he be stood right by it let's give it a go oh we can use it I think we can little littlest make a gap dagger we can yes we've got an anvil unlocked without even knowing it that's sick okay let's go ahead and make all these okay we can now make med hounds as well so let's go ahead and do that a little bit of eggs for XP so yeah I think I'm gonna go ahead and steal from ham members until we get a steal pickaxe because obviously the bronze is just shocking and I think that it's work you know it's worth the grind bit of extra pickpocketing XP we need 27 - 3 d anyway up in Draenor so we might as well go ahead and do that and see if we can get ourselves a steel pickaxe oh my god three pickpockets in it's good to be like I think it's a two in one to two or something okay well that bad didn't a long we got some buds which we I think we do need for something as well and the cowhide so okay a bit of our idea on our site I'll take that the steel pickaxe did speed things up quite considerably but it is still a massive trek going from all the way there coming over to Draenor running under here having to have chicken in the inventory and then running all the way just to make some bronze items so this is probably the last one I'm gonna do just because it's not that efficient and it's a bit of a waste of time and I think it's a pretty good place to end the episode there as well we're really close to unlocking our next chunk so I'm just gonna weigh it off and unlock it in the next episode and see where we're gonna go guys thank you so much for watching anything that you think I should be
