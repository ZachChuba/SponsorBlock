[Music] 20-19 was a year full of good music perhaps it hasn't been the most explosive but a soundcloud rap winds down to a slow end of mediocre posthumous releases and we eagerly anticipate new music from legends like Kendrick Frank Ocean and Travis Scott it's hard to complain about what we got in 2019 in this video I'm gonna list my top 10 favorite releases from artists of any genre before we get into it be sure to check out this video sponsor this video is brought to you by curiosity stream when you sign up at the link in the description you'll also get a free trial for nebula the creator owned streaming video platform that Volks Geist is a part of for number 25 I chose trust of the life-force of the deep mystery by the comet is coming this jazz album is colorful energetic and one of the best jazz pieces I've heard this year at number 24 picture this a Halloween hip hop album sounds goofy right it ended up being a sharp confrontational piece of music with surprising political depth and I know for sure I'll be listening to it for years to come at number 23 The Lost Boy by ybn Corday is pretty corny but I liked it a lot anyway it tells a good story Corde is a good rapper and his beats complement his flow well everything comes together to create a pretty exciting and interesting album but doesn't stay in one place for too long you can easily tell where chordae gets his influences but his songwriting is strong enough and personal to where I think it's entirely possible he has a long and successful career ahead of him at number 22 the greatest downfall of rock music in the 21st century is lethargy sound and fury however is a complete rejection of the idea that rock should stand still or mill about aimlessly in search of its glorious past it may not be Sturgill Simpson's magnum opus but it's great to see an experiment like this go as well as it did Simpson is one of the few artists alive who continues to innovate in the area of Americana and he's doing a great job coming in at number 22 is Brock Hamptons ginger Rockhampton have been through a lot in the last two and a half years and ginger beautifully illustrates their recovery process the album took a lot of criticism for being too sad but I think it's a gorgeous record it's just not saturation and for a lot of people that might be a problem Brock Hampton may never come together again like they did in the summer of 2017 and that's okay they're growing up and sometimes that also means growing apart at number 20 Dave is only 21 years old but his debut album psychodrama is full of meaning in history one of the biggest struggles experienced by UK rappers the perception by the rest of the world that the UK isn't nearly as ghetto or hard as the US but Dave knocks that misconception out of the park with an album that provides a systemic and a visceral look at life in the UK for young black people it's an amazing debut for an artist who will undoubtedly continue to put his city on the map as his career progresses in 19th place swans are perhaps accurately to their name the most animalistic band recording today their music speaks to parts of us that we ignore and push down of constructed meeting we prefer that which makes sense to what we experience in our everyday and swans couldn't represent anything further from that their music creeps up on you like a wolf in the forest or pounces like a lion of the plains it's also more complicated than that as well leaving meaning is one of the most gripping installments in their catalogue yet harsh stabbing glacial collection of sounds and ideas that mixes in with its animism the vicious duplicity of organized team and activity creating music that draws you in while it claws your eyes out in 18th place young thug albums are difficult we've been waiting for a great one for a long time but they always seem to miss the mark and the charts by a narrow margin but so much fun look like it was finally going to break the thugger curse and propel him to the top of the charts and the review lists and it was successful so much fun debuted at number one and received critical acclaim unlike any of thuggish previous projects while young thug may not be as confusing or as out there as he once was so much fun is still an excellent record and thugger still manages to evolve his raps and rhymes with each passing project in 17th place big thief doesn't really do anything revolutionary beside make good music full crock and Fulk in general is pretty stale at this point after a renaissance earlier in the decade we need a break from it it's become kitschy and corny to make music about rolling hills and fresh-baked bread but UFO F is so well composed so well performed and written that it breaks through the curved slump of his genre and makes fulk interesting again for number 16 I chose the Sailor by rich Brian rich Brian's origin story in the rap game is one of the most interesting we've heard in recent memory but until the Sailor his music had never been considered quite as interesting as his backstory the Sailor however is a huge improvement in terms of songwriting production and presentation the album flows nicely as a whole and explores different styles with ease a number 15 anima is a creation that comes directly from the mind of Thom Yorke it was conceived after a period of persistent anxiety and creative block York used layers of electronic fuzz and deconstructed noise to create a dystopian atmosphere that reflects his own struggle with anxiety enema is a self-contained universe a box of stars and planets and cosmic dust represented by Ray flake frequencies and otherworldly pulsing only Thom Yorke could be responsible for something as strange as this and only he will truly ever understand it in 14th place injury reserve is a trio that made it from nothing they come from a city with no rap scene and they themselves have no real business in the rap game their origin story is one of unlikely creativity and a DIY attitude having recorded their first mixtape and a dentist's office the injury reserve sound can perhaps be best summed up as a mix between Death Grips Brock Hampton and Aesop Rock is it boundary-pushing or experimental not necessarily but that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable and genuine sometimes you don't need to reinvent the wheel to make good music all you need is to tell a good story and make music that flows and I think that's exactly what injury Reserve does best Flying Lotus earned his status as a legend many years ago with projects like Cosmo grandma and you're dead Flamengo isn't just another shot at a classic album but rather a collection of moments that aim to exhibit creativity and a variety of different ideas there was a good portion of flylo's fanbase that didn't like this album too much at all and considered it creatively lazy but I think it's still an amazing show of creativity and atmosphere you don't have to compare all music to what the artist did immediately before because while 2014 you're dead maybe a career-defining record Clamato is still an album full of creative melodies beats and features galore Flying Lotus is a master of his craft and flamenco doesn't even hint at him becomes complacent with that title Flying Lotus is a master of his craft and the flamenco doesn't even really begin to hint at him becoming complacent with that title a combination of Freddie Gibbs straight shooting gangster rap and bad libs booty stylistic production is powerful bandana is their second collaboration together and they're only getting better Freddie Gibbs rides the beats like a veteran surfer on his favorite Beach making rapid manoeuvres to keep up with Mad Libs dynamic production the album is just pure connection between producer and rapper and a way that we don't see particularly often in today's hip-hop climate Freddie Gibbs and Madlib have hit a sweet spot bandanna is incredibly consistent it's exactly what it wants to be and nothing more it's beautiful Bon Iver is always changing if it weren't for Justin Vernon's falsetto 2007's 4mo would be completely indistinguishable from III that's because vocals have been and remained to this day bony bears most recognizable asset that's not to say that the instrumentals aren't special - because they are it's just that even bony bears backing tracks have come to be composed in part by layered vocals and vocal samples however on I I Bon Iver finally lifts the veil of cryptic poetry and symbolism he's been gradually weaving for the last 10 years at least partially it's a beautiful album and without a doubt his most forthright III Justin Vernon has found peace he's not running or hiding he's just existing pop theology can be infuriating the way that artists musicians in particular tend to come up with smug self-serving religious justification for their own inadequacies and biases is especially annoying to watch ID Ches major label debut is he real of course glance looks like another mediocre attempt by musician to examine or talk about religion and reinforce their own personal biases while they do so instead is he real ended up being one of my favorite hip-hop albums in recent memory because of the way idk leaves things open-ended he's he real may not be a future classic like idk claims it is but is definitely a fresh sound and it presents a lot of interesting ideas that aren't smug or self-serving idk by the way stands for ignorantly delivering knowledge fka twigs has always been serious with her craft she works hard and it shows clearly in everything she releases Magdalene is her most serious work yet her most intricately crafted work yet theater mentals the instrumentals are massive yet minimal and it ends up sounding like twigs is the hero of her own sci-fi epic piloting a stately spaceship by herself immeasurably far away from the nearest sign of life Magdalene is beautiful melancholic and faraway fka twigs universe is not our own it's a world of original creativity measured beauty and quiet danger Magdalen contains many of the best songs of the last decade listening to Nick Cave isn't something you just do it's a challenge you take on when you want to be shaken to your core his music triggers our primal fears and returns us to moments long-forgotten and shows us moments that won't come for a long time in the future after his son Arthur died in 2015 while tripping on acid Nick caves life and his music was changed forever ghosts Dean makes heavy use of drones sparse piano choral harmonies and since to create an ethereal surreal atmosphere the compliments the album's subject-matter of life death mourning and trauma it's an album that have caught at the right time can stay with you for days haunting your moments of reflection ghosting communicates a deep Universal sadness it's a heartbreaking album that warns us in its cold distant beauty that nothing should be taken for granted ever I thought Tyler the Creator would never top flower boy it was an album full of emotional honesty beautifully composed instrumentals and awesome lyrical storytelling then Igor dropped and it was all of that and more Igor's peak Tyler the Creator in a way that we didn't even know Tyler was capable of it features the least amount of actual rapping that Tyler's ever done on a project so far and that makes sense Tyler is slowly outgrowing hip-hop instead replacing it with a new brand of psychedelic vo soul Uyghurs compositions are intricate its concept is touching and Tyler is clearly grown-up it's a special album that's going to be remembered as one of Tyler's most important musical statements I think I Gore's true strength isn't its production Tyler's vocals are fairly rough but he complements them perfectly with fuzzy melodic singsong production perhaps I Gor didn't speak to me as much as some other alphas that came out this year but it's an undeniable masterpiece for Tyler the Creator lady Browne is almost 40 he didn't break out into the rap game until he was almost 30 but he's not old in his latest album you know what I'm saying proves that without a doubt Danny's always been hard to place he's always held his own court and occupied his own corner of the game and this year's record is no exception to that idea there are a few interesting changes to his rapping and creative choices he's definitely less of a hyena that he usually is on this alpha he melts into the beats rather than jumping out of them like horror movie creature Danny sounds more natural and more musical than ever before it's a fun album it's definitely his most listenable music yet and I'm happy to hear him continue to evolve and reject the idea that rappers have to slow down take a back seat as they age he's more dialed in than ever and just may very well be my favorite work of his yet I've always loved Denzel curry and the music he puts out but Xue ended up being something of a curveball after a deep conceptual album like taboo I think we all expected something more along those lines and instead we got one of the best rap albums of the decade Xue embodies the trapped spirit of the 2010s without any of its classic pitfalls like a boring drawn-out tracklist or flat on creative songwriting the album is only 29 minutes long but it packs in an inspiring tale of denzel's youth in South Florida and what his home means to him it feels almost like Zoo is an album denzil's been wanting to make for a long time and he only just now had the opportunity to do it denzel's music has never exactly fall in line with the South Florida binary of Kodak black and low pump but he's still a contender for the best artist to come out of that scene in the last 10 years zoo is funny exciting and further proof that Denzel curry is nothing if dynamic James Blake's fourth album takes fifth place assumed form presents a few big changes for James Blake while also remaining authentic to the sound he's crafted over the last decade the first half of a sim form incorporates a number of collaborations that reflect Blake's gradual evolution into being a favorite producer and writer for numerous hip-hop artists over the last few years James Blake has worked with Frank Ocean Kanye Travis Scott Kendrick Lamar and Andre 3000 repeatedly a super forum takes that experience and weaves that in with Blake's organic production and song structure creating a flavor of hip hop that sounds equal parts ambient and mainstream Metro boomin provides production for two tracks on the album and even those cuts have a sound that's much more laid-back and as usual output a suit form is one of James Blake's best projects to date thanks to the way it flows together seamlessly like the musical version of a raging river caught by a camera set to long exposure [Music] bili Eilish is just really intelligent her music is divisive people love arguing about it online but no matter whether you enjoy it or not it just sounds so good Billie and her brother Phineas have such a clean well-oiled creative process it makes their music sound like it was conceived by producers and writers far older than themselves Billie is quickly becoming an icon if she hasn't won already 45 million Instagram followers at 17 years old that's gonna be hard to be like I said while her talent is clear hardcore music fans remain divided on whether or not Billie is worth her weight and salt but you can't help but wonder if he even matters at all Billie is so ridiculously successful it seems to be the case that she represents a new kind of good music that her haters just can't understand yet only time will tell but Billie's debut looks like a new breed of pop dark bass heavy and understated we can't do much but hope that she lives up to her potential and avoids the pitfalls of child stardom NFR is Lana Del Rey's masterpiece it's what she's been working towards for the last seven or eight years says the release of Worf to died between then and now she's definitely taken some detours some of which paid off and some of which did but Norman Rockwell sums up the theme she's danced with for her entire career without the ridiculous over stylisation afford to die in ultraviolence that made them a niche product or the overly drawn-out sludgy pace of honeymoon and lust for life that made them her weakest records and a mid-career low-point NFR features majestic arrangements effortless vocals soft mellow instrumental choices it's an album with a consistent message it's not overbearing and the key to enjoying it is to appreciate each of the small moments that come together to make up a true modern classic of the 2010s Vlada del rey is a defining artist of the last decade and she deserves every ounce of praise that been thrown at this album the main idea between Natali bearings Titanic rising is that reality is collapsing or at least the reality that makes sense to us this concept evokes comparisons to father John misty but unlike misty who revels in the destruction of everything around him with the third Gleave marring faces the apocalypse with a calmer demeanor her and Misty share a color palette as well seventy soft rock instrumentation mixed it with the few water ideas and concepts but Titanic rising has a sense of sincerity and idealism that misty could only ever dream of bearing hopes for the best but doesn't lie to herself Titanic rising is EXA central it's an exploration of the galaxies that exist within our heads and escapism without forgetting the album is spacious is subtle yet grand it's timeless yet painfully relevant and rare as its influences on a sleeve while sounding wholly original Titanic Riesling is one of the best albums not leave the year but of the decade it offers answers to our deepest existential fears environmental collapse growing up as individuals love and loneliness technology and consumerism waste blood is an immensely talented cultural competent whose music will go down in history as some of the best to come from the last decade the imagery the meaning and the emotion on Titanic rising makes it my favorite album of the year it's an answer to our generations fears a satellite floating through space Assad beat on the ocean floor Titanic rising is a helping hand in the darkness is my favorite album of 2019 any stream comm slash Volks Geist and entering the code Fulks Geist
