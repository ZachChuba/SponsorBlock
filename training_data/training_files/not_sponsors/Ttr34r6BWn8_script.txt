what's poppin flex nation and welcome back to another episode of the biggest flexes in anime number 11 so I know I said I wasn't gonna do the Flex nation bit again but I got so many comments saying back flex nations own hashtag lakes nation now let's not ever do it again there everyone's happy now I'm happy we're not doing it again you're happy we did it one more time win-win and speaking of win wins I wanted to do a themed biggest flexes in anime episode and I was very much leaning to light novel themed characters from light novel based anime adaptations that flex really hard now having this vague outline in mind I was thinking sort of outline the irregular of magic high school - rah rah rah and then I was approached by the mobile game crossing void who essentially said hell are mr. Noxon Orson to which I immediately corrected that Lord Luxan or sama to you and of course they were very cordial and continued calling me Lord Knutson or sama from that point on and they were like so crossing void is this very interesting new game because not only is it like a good game and whatever and I was like hahaha but it contains anime characters from like a billion different light novels and I was like oh so the original thought was for me to do a dedicated video on certain light novels and have an appearance in crossing void and I was like wait a second I wanted to do this anyway so in the biggest flexes of anime number 11 seven of the eight flexes present will be from characters that have an appearance in crossing void and then the eighth character is going to be from one of the big three because I made a pact with myself that every single episode of the biggest Lex is Anatomy will have at least one character from the big three why did I make this pact with myself because I'm nuts so let's get into the meat and potatoes of the biggest flexes in anime elaborate remember to smash like because eighty thousand likes and the biggest flexes in anime twelve will be out within a week first legs the fact that I'm flexing and other youtubers because this is how you make a sponsored video fam and first anime flanks yes I'm gonna be starting strong with sword art online I know sword art online had a lot of talk on YouTube whether you love it or you hate it or you hate to love it you fall in one of those three categories and everyone had something to say that sort of except me because I started my channel after disorder online hypetrain ended so I could not leech off it unfortunately so here we go a brand new take of key neato the master flexor from sword art online because no matter what you say and whatever category you fall into beauty toe flexes a lot okay and I'm not just talking about no hacks like after he dies he comes back to life to kill Kayaba no that's not flexing that's hacks and will be included in my biggest hacks in anime video that may or may not be coming soon to definitely subscribe what I am talking about is the fact that in Alf I'm online when there was like this whole massive war that was gonna break out between the salamander guys versus the Cait sis and the other four billion races that I can't really keep track of because let's just say the lore and outf I'm online was not exactly the strongest world building and all of anime ever but this massive torrential battle was gonna take place and then Quito a single sprig in is like I am an ambassador and I will fight you and then enemy general Eugene who was by the way voice acted by Lord Twigg Oh says I'm now an L foolish boy I am never 14 trillion and I will face you and then Kirito annihilate it which is very cool that was just a flex on everyone so that they could join him in his mission to save assam and that's not his only flex he does a ton of inadvertent flexing as well like in gun Gale online the fact that this guy took a lightsaber to fight snipers and opponents with assault rifles is a huge flags yes from his perspective it was unintentional but that's just what makes the flags are better does it make sense that he blocks an assault rifle with a light saber no even in Star Wars if the enemy droids would use this on people's the chair would be screwed it's called a spade a spade why are they all single-shot pistols okay not talking about epic Star Wars flexes here we'll stay on topic get ito winning a gun tournament with a lightsaber is a massive flex from everyone else's perspective my personal favorite Kirito flex in all of saudade ornerier news in the mother's rosário art so i've stated several times that I personally really loved the AI Incred arc and the mother's Rosario arc and I personally thought the rest of it was yeah you know it could have been better and this scene in the mother's Rosario arc is my favorite scene from that art bark mainly follows asana and with the sleeping Knights who were all layers that dived into the game but they all have a crazy illness making them not long for this world they are extremely good in game because they've pretty much escaped to real life in order to live full-time in this virtual reality it's very sad I know and they had a dream that they wanted to single-handedly beat a boss so they could get their names immortalized on this stone because they are the opposite of immortal yes the theme is actually relatively dark and we don't have TV tow a lot because we wanted to focus on asana successfully did absolutely nothing for the majority of the series no offence as the defense just spit in fact here PT toes massive flex is when the new boss fight is about to start and you have your like six sleeping night guys trying to attack the boss and this massive raid party of hundreds potentially even thousands of players are running behind them cuz they want to beat the boss the sleeping nights are like oh well dreams ruined what can we do we can't face all these way too many guys and then Kirito stands up for his women and says I will face these 14 trillion dudes now obviously Kirito can't win he's not intending to win and of course he loses off-screen because we can't actually have to lose on-screen but if I can just express how much I love this scene kyoto uses everything he learns in gun Gale online to block magic attacks with his bare hands just wielding swords in Alfheim um and of course he flexes on them saying ah these magic attacks are way slower than you know assault rifle rounds and he proceeds to block all of them and then face off single-handedly against like a billion players with Klein way in the background his client is always way in the background and yes it is absolutely true that cutie toe did not stand a chance and probably lost that fight even though it was off-screen but he managed to hold off an army so that the sleeping Knights can actually fight now the reason why this flex is so big is purely because he knew nothing about the sleeping nights he had no reason to ruin his reputation and fight and hold down this army while the sleeping nights could fight the boss he did it purely because the person he loved seemed like she wanted him to do it and because of that very basic reason alone he flexed on the entire top tier player base of Alf I'm Amla her ever sullying his own reputation and flex on them he did if you hold off an army of players that should all be relatively equivalent in strength to you that's a huge flag so ordered online haters I apologize but there's a lot of great in there and this flex was huge yes essentially biggest flexes at anime is a series where I could just talk about my favorite scenes unfiltered and no one could question me what of it sorry had to flex on you there I just love what I do fam and loving what you do makes what you do better so do what you love yes very inspirational video here talking about sword art online glad we're all on the same page thanks thanks sadao maou otherwise known as satan from the devil is a part-timer devil in the title referring to Satan also known as sit down Mao who is Satan the devil that is currently a part-timer yes that's a relatively long title of an anime I understand but it's a reverse II Sakai it's a story about sadao maou who was a devil that later works as a part-timer when he leaves his devilish realm and joins our normal world and needs a way to make money so he works at McDonald's instead of trying to take over the universe like most Devils seem to do yes you know shysters gonna be goddamn hilarious when Satan becomes the protagonist and works in a fast-food restaurant and it is sadao maou becomes one of the greatest anime protagonists I kid you not ever and this is one of my favorite ISA Chi anime I kid you not again ever easily top 10 now of course the female protagonist is the hero from the other world that comes to the normal human world to try and capture slash kill Satan with this point she's just a really good dude working hard hours in the fast food place where somehow he becomes the really positive fellow and the hero ends up fits under a bimbo the setup is flawless the characters are amazing I can't get over how much he loved this anime and it said that no one really talks about it because I really needs a season to please so before putting this video together I was like alright gotta get this fresh in my mind to raise my hype levels so I can convey the awesomeness to you so there are two extremely awesome flexes that Satan does in Devils apart Tiber and I just rewatched both of those episodes before putting this script together come hither my children because this app is even better than I remembered alright so first off Satan pretty much doesn't have any powers in this world because his power source comes from the dismay and distress of others around him that he can then harness to make himself more powerful since he's not wreaking havoc in this world and everything is more or less decently he pretty much don't have no powers so everyone that attacks him knows that too so there's this whole strategy between some priests guys and some rebellious demon dude that they want to like take him down and yeah that doesn't really work out so well they attack him and they cause a little ruckus and that little ruckus that they caused gives him more than enough power to completely annihilate both of them but when he does he expresses to them just how petty of a threat they actually hearted his opponents like Lucifer okay and Lucifer's readying this massive attack and all of a sudden Satan is fast enough to just appear in his face and then slowly says to Emmy the hero by the way who was supposed to be killing him but is at this point sort of on his side cuz she's it's indirect hey what should I do with him well Emmy says he should take responsibility for turning the city upside down and then Satan says that's right not to mention that if I'm late for work after this it's your fault Lucifer at this point Lucifer is like pissing himself he is terrified what are you talking about and Satan then carefully and slowly explains to him what are you going to do if I miss out on employee of the month because of this and of course other demons in the background are hearing this and they obviously don't know what's going on they don't realize he's working in a fast-food place and they're like he speaks of Mad as eternally beyond our comprehension and at this point Satan is strong enough and is gathered enough power to basically wipe the snot outta Lucifer with a punch but instead Satan gives him you know the respect that he should wild flexing on his face entirely saying stand ready as a demon general should and then he slowly takes his time to charge an attack with not one magic circle which is more than enough to defeat him but like thousands of them so that we get a bird's-eye view from the atmosphere of Satan making a little explosion turning Lucifer into a trembling little [ __ ] that sin says I am so sorry I will never disobey you and the beauty is Satan's like no problem fan it's not possible for you to even want to disobey me after I flex on you so hard if likes odd this guy that rebelled against him so hard he had so much faith in him now because he knows there's no way after the massiveness of the Flex this guy will ever rebel ever again anyone right I'm sorry but this flex is huge now I was gonna talk about his other flex which isn't like episode 10 of the series but even though it's not a real spoiler cuz it's just how he destroys his opponent it was so damn enjoyable you have no idea whole thing is 12 episodes I kid you not you are missing out if you haven't seen it your watch the devil is a part-timer you'll piss in your pants from hilarity and the flexes in episode 5 and 10 are chills worth like for example in middle of his flex in episode 10 he's up against this guy who was so cockily expecting to be far stronger than Satan and while Satan is fighting him he takes his time to catch the tsundere who's falling off a building and tell her oh by the way Emmy random thought I could see your boobs your shirt is accidentally torn in the front but I'm just gonna continue fighting right now and he did it like an absolute gentle I mean I'm a big fan of motherís flex when he flexed on the COG a telling them yo cog a it's your choice if you want my wood clones to use Susanoo or not I think that that's a brilliant flex and one of his greatest and well let's just say if I can compare a fight in episode 10 of a show to have equivalent level flexing with Madara who was hyped forever it's done something right because he's up against this guy Sariel and he says to Sariel Sariel has a benevolent overlord as i am i let you choose and Terrell's it choose what will you run away with your tail between your legs or will you pay for this by becoming my punching bag and then with the most bored expression of all time he says to him choose your fate the Flex was gorgeous it was huge two down now you are one of the greatest flexors I highly recommend the devil is a part-timer max max and it's from do rah rah the hype is real it is not often that I could talk about the absolute mad laddering of Shizuo hey whoa Jima yes my favorite character in the series is hands-down Izaya orihara onna comes two biggest flexors we gotta talk about the real flexor here first alright so for those of you who don't know what do da Dada is about it's about a city called Ikebukuro this city pay attention closely cos is the only place you'll hear it said is the protagonist of durarara yes we have several characters that are more main characters than others but it's all within the context of what's going on in Ikebukuro the city is the protagonist fact now there's a lot of really weird stuff going on in ekabo Kato the seeming main character Mikado Rudy who Gaby name is secretly the leader of this massive gang there are also several other massive gangs there's also some supernatural stuff going on like a sword that can create zombies that obey you but you don't even notice because they're normal people until you kind of turn on the zombification thing and all of a sudden they're slaves to the owner of that magic sword there's also a headless horseman or well headless horse woman that isn't on a horse that is on a motorcycle which is her horse it gets weird okay and like she's extremely powerful with her black scythe magic OOP thing oh and the beauty of this anime is surface level when you're first introduced to e Kabukicho don't really notice anything weird going on but as you proceed to learn more about the happenings within e kabuki know you realize that it is absolute chaos behind the scenes I love it it's a brilliant take on society in our all society on the outside looks normal it happenstance but underneath everyone didn't say maybe I'm self projecting a little bit we are going to ignore that and I still love my interpretation of do da da da now why am i mentioning this this isn't let me tell you about H epic anime also fun fact there were flexes in them no no I have to explain to you exactly how nutso this city is in order to explain why she's all here G lies the greatest flexes ever out of context yeah true he flexes hard but within the context of a city that has undead demons a mafia several Russian KGB operatives strategically placed throughout a mad scientist's zombification sword and an information broker who is by the way the greatest character in the series and one of the greatest of all time that really is the only guy that seems to know everything that's happening and he still manages to get punched in the face literally in the final episode of every season of doo da da da I love this chaos so now that you realize a ton of random stuff is going on and all of it sounds extremely badass let me tell you about cheese well here with Gmail he's this guy who's abnormally strong yes is correct you heard me right I did not stutter he's a regular dude he's not mafia he is not KGB he is not part of a gang he is not Undead he is not magic in any way and he's not super brilliant sociopath that just likes toying with human emotion he is a regular guy and he's not even at the main character so now this regular guy that walks around in a barkeep uniform mostly because someone bought of a barkeep uniform and he worked as a barkeep at but then got fired cuz he accidentally destroyed like everything so he's like yeah why waste money on new clothes I'll just walk around looking like a barkeep it's genius it's nonchalant regular guy he's the most powerful most terrifying character in the entire city he makes friends with a bunch of people hate some other people but in this world of undead sword mind controlled individuals almost taking over a city and they are single-handedly defeated by just Shizuo you know you're messing with a flexor the guy throws vending machines he kicks vans across the street and he rips up an entire guardrail to hit people with he uses highway signs to play golf with cars going 80 miles an hour he punched someone in the face so hard that as they flew away spinning all their clothes flew off he hits people with lamp posts not with weapons he keeps on him and when he wants to get to the top floor of the building he could literally just run up the side of the bill this guy flexes Colorado by being the only normal guy but still by far the strongest and most terrifying there's a lot of crazy [ __ ] going on in ekabo Coto and the one thing they actually warn people who stay away from Shizuo he would Jean next fatsia Shiba from the irregular in magic high school fun fact Tatsu Shiba actually is the irregular at the magic high school in question and yes that is not a spoiler this guy's overpowered from moments a so at first he's like oh I don't really be so good magic I don't do know how to are using stuff and like everyone's like wow that guy's English sucks balls okay I added that for flavor no one ever said that now he's not so good at magic without using magic tools so at first they rate him really low and you know he proceeds to flex on everyone for the entire series at first you think yeah he's not so good at magic he can only use tools and then you realize when he uses tools he's like literally the greatest sorcerer in the world hanging on as I said the world not know uh-oh now you probably think I'm exaggerating I understand that you have an overpowered student but the students not gonna be like this drunk is never right wrong so this case I would personally change the title to the flexor at magic high school and not gonna lie it's an even hyper title than the irregular a magic high school it would have definitely sold more copy in the beginning we're like okay so there are crazy magic tools that everyone has and uses to get by and tatsi of course uses them to their utmost extent what you didn't know is that not only is Tatsuya really freaking awesome and magic while using magic tools but he also invents all the magic tools yeah that's right they couldn't just make him broken because of items they had to also have him make the items that the entire universe uses which makes him broken he's so broken in fact that they don't even call him out on the incest yes his sister loves him of course because little sisters and animators tend to do that occasionally and the show's not even made fun at because of the incest because he's so broken yes there's this evil meeting of really powerful evil dudes in some building somewhere and Tatsuya from like a hundred miles away with a pistol clicks the trigger and everytime he clicks the trigger a different member of that council of evil dudes evaporates that's right the distinct two greats this entire meeting of evil dudes from miles away by clicking the trigger of a handgun that's just an example to show how he's very overpowered and happens to flex a lot but you know something's really not right when he goes into a basement takes a sniper rifle no like what do you ever know his neighbor Eiffel and he's like oh you know that invasion that's about to attack us that a huge fleet of ships yeah I got this and the government official guys don't like oh I don't see why you could be able to do that and he just flexes on them saying yeah let me just click the trigger for one second and he does and he just integrates the entire fleet of ships that were attacking them yeah this guy flicks is a hell of a lot in fact I may have even made it sound a little dumb and I apologize if I did but even though explaining his overpowered nough says make it sort of sound ugh I cannot ell to express that the flexes were actually top t I mean when the guy is clicking the trigger of his handgun inside and no bullets are coming out and everyone's like what are you actually doing and he's like oh nothing then you see like an outside view a bunch of enemy jeeps that are about to attack them purchase descent yeah he's a flexor what guy say doesn't take credit for these shoes you think that's broken he also has clones of himself that could regenerate to the health that they were in up to like 24 hours ago and he can also heal anyone up to 24 hours before as well so yes brokenness abilities then freakin stop ever so even though I would say that the power scaling in this series is not the utmost greatest two flexes are and now crossing void for sponsoring this video and back to the video so the next flex I wanted to talk about it was a flexor I wanted to talk about for a while it's excel from two out of majutsu no index so will disclosure the reason why I didn't talk about him yet is because even though I've seen bits and pieces of him and I absolutely love the guy because he's a psycho not that I relate to him or anything about cos he's because I never successfully sat through the whole damn series I have history I have beef with the index franchise long story short I got together with a friend yes an IRL friend those exist too it's not that anyone else could see him but I could see him that's what counts for me and we got together to watch index I was really hyped II was really hard to watch one episode I liked it it was around midnight so we made a package we will continue this tomorrow then the next day came I met up with him and he already finished the entire freakin series oh you think I meant one season no he watched two seasons bastard any case I haven't gotten back to index I'm sorry accelerator but the scenes i have seen is already a character that i can say i personally love the fact that this guy is fighting against main character whamon and she says what are you even after you're already like the strongest guy ever and he's like I know I'm not chasing any specific goal in fact I do already have power I am chasing absolute power and then in the next scene he completely flicks away main character Wham ins ultimate attack and then like oh this was that your ultimate attack that was pretty stupid I don't know I saw that scene and I was just totally floored but noble from lost pause is like oh my god you gotta talk about accelerator he's an epic flexor so here is two minutes of noble hyping to crap out of accelerator Thank You noble extremely cool link to nobles channel is also in the description the guy's a beast and he's really trying to convince me to watch index I'd definitely show what's cracking fan base can I say that today we're gonna be talking about one of the best flexors I'm talking about accelerator he is the number one expert in an entire Academy City his ability vectors allows him to change the direction of anything that comes his way he can even get Newt and he would be perfectly fine now this guy is so sick of everyone challenging his number one rank of strongest that he wanted to shift to a level six so nobody would even dare think of getting close to which he agreed to do an experiment to kill level three ability clones of Misaka Mikoto however the clones only have the power of level threes so that's why he's has to kill approximately 20,000 of these clones but anyway the flights today I'll be talking about is the ten thousand and thirty one Misaka where she is running away from this godlike character and he's just casually walking she eventually brings him to a point after being utterly humiliated to a point where he steps on a landmine and it explodes underneath him and she thinks this finally gets him site target has finally been neutral oh no of course he does the dramatic stepping out of the dust like come on was that it grabs her leg and just casually rips it up like a frickin chicken drumstick she's crawling away still trying to fight back and he's just like ah looks like I broken another one he lifts up an entire train and drops it on top of her there was no need he just decided you know what train her like frickin road roller deal would be proud of this boy alright but this is where we'll end it today so I hope you guys enjoyed my little tribute to accelerator flexing now back to you next next so this is from an anime called quino's journey and well I can't really spoil it because it's about this character named Kino the journeys around to many different civilizations and societies learning different things along the way it is one of my favourite slice-of-life anime I will just put that out there but the thing about Kino is she is just a ramen with a pistol and for whatever reason no matter what she's up against in any of these civilizations she ends up flexing on them I don't want to give you specific examples because every single episode in quino's journey has a punch line that is definitely far better experienced watching it and you can get the entire vibe from a single episode yes it gets better almost every episode but you'll get the idea by just watching one he no pulls up to new city tries to learn things about the society turns out everything is really twisted he no flexes on them and leaves and I just figured I kind of had to include that into the biggest flexes and anime series because well it flexes once an episode slack so until this point in the biggest flexes in anime series I've talked about characters flexing on one another like Eskin or flexing and esther osa telling him he pities him I've had people flexing on an army like Madara dropping a second meteor the first one wasn't really a flex the second was a huge flight we've had people flexing on the entire known world like shanks from one piece pulling on to marine Ford and stopping the war we've had people flexing on the god of their universe like Tania the evil telling God yeah guy thanks for bringing me back to life but I don't believe you exist and we've had one punch man flexing on the meta-narrative of all shown in anime they're all working so hard to get strong and he just one punches these insane opponents we've had flexes on all levels of scale but not non-flex quite like the one i'm about to mention from golden time yes you're thinking to yourself wait a second golden time isn't that a romance anime yes it is a romance anime it is one of my favorite romance anime by the way and this flex this beautiful flex flex is on genders and sexualities themselves there's this one too who is being harassed by a whamon who loves him and as much as he tries he can not get away from this whamon trying to hook up with her so then Tata Bondi the protagonist whose name echoes for generations walks up to his friend as his friend is being attacked by this whamon who is trying to have his babies puts his arm around his friend inside the boundary absolutely breaks the fabric of anime with the awesomeness of this flag that is correct this absolute madly flexed on her concept and her understanding of sexualities as she knew it in this one moment she the stalking bimbo was completely annihilated from the most flamboyant flexing of all time you thought it was kinda gay when Alex Lewis Armstrong keeps throwing off his clothes every two seconds to give hugs to the Elric brothers well that's got nothing on Todd de bon flexing with the power of apps gayness to chase away this thought I know I thought it's pretty beautiful touch my soul finally we get to the big three flex meaning one flex from a character in the big three because I can't do a flex video without talking about one the big three we've talked in Minah tone ami cos eight the fourth hokage now I can recite all of the various things he's done throughout the series I can talk about how he teleported a tailed beast bomb into the distance and then said boom as it exploded miles away I can talk about how this guy mastered sage chakra mode in literally an instant when he was revived and even though he was already missing half his limbs he was still able to fight Madara and Juby toe for a bit I can talk about how when most people use the shadow shuriken jutsu it's like they threw two shuriken but this guy throws Asher can use the shadow shuriken jutsu and it's like he fired a massive Gatling gun of shuriken I can talk about how this guy out sped the Fourth Reich a guy who was said to be as fast as lightning in their fight but honestly I don't think any of that encapsulates exactly how much this guy flexes no even when he dropped his bag beat up a whole group of enemy ninja that were about to hurt Kakashi and Kakashi was his student and then you see the bag land on the ground that was just brilliant visual storytelling and the narrator of Naruto as well as the producers flexed on us on the fourth hokage's behalf the biggest flex in my opinion about Minato is the fact that this guy was labeled a threat level of run on site yes many dangerous opponents in war but how often is a single individual opponent given the run on site rating the fact that this guy is so dangerous just by seeing him turn the other direction and rot the fact that no matter what massive battle strategy you have and how many men are by your side while you're attacking or defending when you see Minato turn tail and drop the battlefield like a hot potato flexed on the concept of war in autonomy kaze epic flexor very cool dad smash like on the biggest flexes in anime 11
