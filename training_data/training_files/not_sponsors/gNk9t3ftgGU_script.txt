today I want to talk about a people that sailed across the oceans in search of treasure and trade and monopolies on valuable resources and also who founded colonies across those vast oceans yes I'm talking about not them then I also want to talk about another people who I hardly ever mention in my videos which is surprising for some the Romans and now you might be thinking well what on earth have the Romans who were around from 27 BC to 476 ad as an empire whereas the Viking Age range from 793 AD to around 1066 depending on whose definition you choose so clearly they were not contemporary of each other however there was a relationship between the ancestors of the peoples in Scandinavia who would become Vikings and the Romans and it's this that I want to explore a little bit in this video because it's a very interesting topic pretty much from the get-go the Roman Empire started to expand but they ran into the problem that the more they expanded they encountered new tribes that tried to invade so the way to keep the bits of the Empire safe was to invade those tribes and this carried on in a very long cycle until they reached the Germanic peoples in northwestern Europe and when they came into contact with these peoples they obviously tried to conquer them and to pacify them but of course in 980 the very famous battle of Teutoburg forest occurred this was a catastrophic defeat in which three legions were completely annihilated and the honour of Rome that had been built up for so many centuries had been lost in this catastrophic battle now afterwards they decided that instead of going in and trying to pacify the Germanic tribes time and time again deep forests in magnet ammonia well they would instead do is employ a new tactic and that was to look at the tribes beyond those demonic tribes that they were fighting on their frontiers of course the enemy of my enemy is my friend so they looked at the tribes in Scandinavia the ancestors of the Vikings because of course the Germans and the Danes have always been best a friend you to North VPN for the sponsorship there is actually rather a lot of evidence of the relationship between the Romans and the tribes living in Denmark archaeological and otherwise and also of the impact that contact with the Romans had on these peoples and how that in some way led to the start of the Viking Age now actually at a site on the island of fern a site called Hobie actually there was found a silver set a silver banquet set and what's special about that is that it was clearly a Roman design and it's actually the only complete silver banqueting set that has ever been found from the Roman period outside of Italy it's interesting as well because it was a Roman commanders prized possession these were expensive sets to have made a very nice silver and with lots of designs on them and one of the designs unfortunately I've not got a copyright free image but you're welcome to go and Google the Hobby in fact I'll put it in the description is of a celtic defeated warlord giving vassalage homage to a Roman leader so there is an interesting implied message they're saying to the Danes you could be a part of this system but clearly the Romans are the ones wearing the pants or should I say the toga moving aside from that very bad pun we also need to look at the changes that are happening in scandinavian society from the Nordic Bronze Age which was around from 1700 BC around to about 2 500 BC when we switch into a period that's known as the Nordic Iron Age the key difference being the key metal that was prized at the time now the Nordic Iron Age itself is also split into several parts to begin with from around 500 BC we have the pre-roman Iron Age before the Roman contact started to get into Denmark in any significant way following that we have the Roman Iron Age which continued to around about 300 AD and following that time around 300 AD continues into the vendor area which goes on until the Viking Age at the very end so you can sort of see the timescale of what came before the Vikings in Denmark and large parts of Scandinavia and now I want to talk a little bit about the cultural and societal impact that various external so like the Romans for example but also some internal factors had on the population first of all is that during the Nordic Bronze Age people lived in clan groups where communal ownership was the name of the game however when the Nordic Iron Age came along a new set of elites seemed to have taken over and this has led to the clan system fracturing and it becoming a familial system instead with individual ownership now an important part of this distinction is that cattle in the Bronze Age had been kept communally by the clan all in pasture together but now cattle because of the individual ownership were owned by individual families and so they were being kept separate and being kept indoors in barn because now it was an issue if your cattle got mixed up with your neighbors then you didn't know whose was who where as before this hadn't been an issue now of course when you keep cattle inside they poo and so you get manure but of course manure can be used to fertilize the fields which means that fields recover quicker and are more fertile so it means that this leads to better harvests as well as being able to keep the cattle out in the same fields for much longer which in turn led to population increase and with population increase this starts the drive towards societal change and this certainly happens in the case that before people have been on fairly level pegging fields whereas now you start to get some families that were becoming wealthier and some who were poorer this power differential meant that the richer farmers all sorry the poorer farmers would become indebted to the richer farmers and so the richer farmers would employ the poorer farmers as their warriors as their retainers and so the society became more violent especially with individual ownership meaning that cattle raiding and things like they started to take off in a much larger way than it had done during the Nordic Bronze Age but what's interesting is that the people supplying these various or what would become kingdoms or sub kingdoms at this time were the Romans and actually we know this because of bog deposits there are over 25 such bogged deposits in Denmark alone which are full of Roman weapons and so that was part of the Roman side of the agreement for these Danes keeping those Germanic tribes at bay along the Lemus along the frontier was this exchange in weapons and we find this back in Iron Age Denmark which is very interesting as well even the religion at the time was very much influenced by the Romans who had real pantheon of gods of figures with names and attestation z' whereas before during the Bronze Age it had been more like nature worship where you would worship say the idea of the Sun or the moon things like this at this time they started to transition over to a real pantheon of gods again inspired largely by the Romans and this is when you get names like soon or in Old English Thor in Old Norse or sooner in old Frisian all of these names actually being the same word as thunder in the various languages but of course today we know Thor in English which is actually bird from Old Norse as you will see as the name of the god but the name actually derives from the same word as for the things that you can see how it was connected but around about this time these development starts to take place as well we have that the Romans were hiring these Danes and possibly some Norwegians too of course these were not countries at the time but speaking from a modern perspective as their auxilia to go and fight in the Roman army and then they would return home with knowledge of Roman military tactics now of course they would return as well with the knowledge of writing which was incredibly important and very central to the idea of Roman power and authority and it's not a coincidence that it's around the second century when we think that ruins these Germanic letters that the Germanic tribes were developing were starting to be produced and written down and there is a clear correlation between the runic alphabet and the Latin alphabet we're not sure which Latin alphabet it came from there could well have been influences from Etruscan for example all the Greek alphabet but there is definitely a relationship between the two and contact with the Romans certainly hastened the Germanic tribes and the Danes as well into becoming a more literate culture in at least in terms of runes as well they came into contact with a monetary economy obviously taxes were incredibly important for the Romans taxes and coins and having an actual economy and a currency and minting this was a little bit into the future for these tribes but at this time there were people starting to produce coins and get this idea of Taxation which then started to happen in Denmark as well as these figures became more powerful and more centralized control started to occur now we also find the trading towns start to spring up to take advantage of this trade with the Romans although of course as the Roman Empire slowly the boundaries recede back towards Rome this becomes more and more strained although the trading contents do continue and later when Rome Falls Byzantium takes over as the key trading partner and so you start to get gold solidi these coins coming from Santiam across the trade routes whereas before it would have been trade with Rome around 150 AD you get the construction of what was known as holger's dike which was across Eleanor hit land and this was actually a very large palisade with a ditch and a rampart and it's thought that it wasn't strong enough to militarily have been a barrier but actually there it was some kind of very early customs that they were trying to control trade and Taxation and of course to have such a big project that must have been funded and organized and overseen by a very centralized Authority so we're already starting to talk about some very powerful King in this area of yet lon potentially even of all of your plant at this point probably still a sub King also what's interesting is that the design of holger's dike is almost identical to the way that the Romans built the Lemus the frontier actually the same etymology where the English word limit comes from is from Lemus and I actually went and visited part of the Lemus while some of it's very close to my house where I live Hadrian's Wall but also in Romania when I was there and of course this must mean that there is some kind of very strong cooperation in connection between the Danes who have been out probably serving on the limits who then came home from their mercenary work and then informed the local chieftains the local sub kings petty kings about how they were building things now when the Romans disappear as I already indicated they do still continue to make things in their image so to speak these brackets as they are called a found across the Germanic North Sea culture and are actually inspired by the medallions that were made by the Romans now as well around this time we start to get the construction in the early 7th century of the da Nvidia which I referenced earlier I've mentioned it in several other videos it means that Dame works and these are large earthworks across the southern tip of the Atlanta Peninsula of yellin and these were essentially to keep out the people's to the south but also that suggests that the people's to the north were unified enough to put an effort in to make such very large constructions they were as well they were revamps and they were refurbished biking gone later on in the 10th century but already at this point they started to be built in the early 7th century so this gives some kind of clue as to how centralization was progressing in Denmark and again that this was sort of kick-started in many ways by interaction with the Romans by learning from the Romans in this early period and how many of these things then continued on into the Viking Age because of these early interaction alright everyone thank you very much for watching this has been my video on a bit about the Nordic Bronze Age in the transition into the Nordic Iron Age based on a lecture that I had yesterday that I thought was really interesting and I wanted to share some information on that with you all if you are interested in this and would like to know more then please do leave me a comment give me a thumbs up and subscribe and I might actually consider looking into doing some more videos on this kind of thing I'll have some more Viking you things also have some anglo-saxon videos on the way and some flag things if I remember correctly from all the videos that I've made big thank you to North VPN for sponsoring this one do check them out because it is a very useful thing to have on your person so thanks for watching I've been held but and this has been the history
