[Music] tool and Nikola pro according this channel at the all-electric tier alright YouTube so we are back again with another Kirby country road test this time running 20 20 X 16 dot 2.1 in my 2018 model 3 with hardware 3.0 and the FST update so we are going to take this Kirby country road test if you haven't seen this series before I have a huge playlist that you can click on and that will be down in the link below so here's our first term we have coming up you can see whoa we are going off the right side of the road just a little bit no warnings from the car but went off the right side of the road although it didn't I did not have to disengage here is 20 20 12.5 the last software update and it performed beautifully so not a great start to this test but I will say you're gonna want to stick around for the end of this video because this software version 20 2016 2 dot 1 is really impressive on some of these curves I sped this part of the tape up and now I'm gonna slow it down because we have a pretty significant right-hand curve here and you can see it handles it beautifully not only is a car slowing down but it's maintaining that center lane position just like we like ok this test has been a struggle the last couple software updates that we've tested on and let's see what happens here so we start to go we have another car coming and right there at the midway point of the sharpest point of the turn I have to disengage and so it does go a little bit faster on this older software test before I do end up disengaging because it just goes in way too fast so here is another old test that we did and you can see I disengaged at about the same point in looking at this test I think Tesla limits the degree in which the car is allowed to turn win in autopilot you can see here that it looks like it's gonna do a great job but then I think it's only allowed to turn the steering wheel a certain degree right now when the car is engaged in autopilot that's why we get the immediate takeover immediately because the car is recognizing that it needs to make a sharper angle turn or turn the wheel and a further angle then it's allowed to I think that Tesla has some underlining provisions in the software limiting how far the steering wheel can turn pretty straight here in the test but we are coming up to a blind Hill here so let's see what the car does we did get a take over immediately in the first test and no issues there now we have a right curve here and we are slowing down significantly just like we want to see just like a normal human would drive on this type of road a normal humans gonna slow down and just like autopilot doing here really really smooth big improvement over the last software update if you haven't seen that go watch Kirby country road test number 15 the previous video to this one here so now we have one of the last really aggressive curves on this first section road and let's see what happens so typically I have to take over here and you can see that it slows down all the way I think it got down to 16 miles per hour but I did not have to disengage it was able to go through here's test number 14 and you can see I have to disengage going 27 miles an hour versus this current test here on this curve no disengagement necessary and test the autopilot slows down all the way to actually 14 we saw right there so really impressive with the autopilot system slowing down really significantly identifying that there is a severe curve in the road very very impressive so here we can see on the center display it actually shows that we have a stop sign coming up but you can see here that there is no stop sign visible until we make this final little curve here and then the car is actually able to see so that tells us again that we are seeing actual data from maps and the car is using the autopilot system as far as stoplight and traffic light control is using that autopilot data now I do engage although this is sort of a funky t intersection and the car does say take over immediately and it's smart enough to identify that type of intersection so really cool to see that we get another message about a stop sign on the center display although we are taking this fork right before the stop sign so I do have to disengage autopilot here and then I can re-engage it after I yield and make sure there's no other traffic coming so here we are in a little small part of the town which I always try to catch the train and unfortunately I did not catch the train here to see if the car will stop but with this new software update we do see that it is saying hey there is a straf ik light here and you need to acknowledge before i'm gonna go through that traffic light so i let the car come to almost a complete stop before i do acknowledge that ok there's no train we can cross so really cool because i did test this in a previous video when this traffic light and stop light just came out and it would show the light on the center display but it would not stop or require acknowledgment before going through so now we can go through here and we are going to re-engage autopilot and this is a really tricky curve right here because the double yellow line opens up here and we get about the same amount of fail where it goes and crosses the double yellow line we can see in test number 15 that it did about the same as far as disengagement goes but here if we look in test number 14 we can see that we got the exact same disengagement where the car started to make the turn and then started to drift back and then said hey wait take over immediately I'm not ready to handle this and the same again in test number 13 as well as far as the take over immediately so this right curve here is going to definitely be challenging for the autopilot system and the autopilot team in that the double yellow line in the middle does vanish for a period of time because of that intersection back there so let's re-engage autopilot now and carry on through this curvy country road test this is the second half of the curvy country road test check out on the opposite side of the road we have a bike coming and the visualization actually picks it up on the center display never seen the visualization pick up a bike on the opposite side of the road here we have a pretty significant left turn that curves up and auto pilot is doing a beautiful job and again this I think maybe five software updates ago kind of mastered that last turn and so it is still doing a good job on that curve so we're gonna speed up a bit to go to our next significant curve as this part of the road isn't really challenging for the autopilot and there was no disengagement from me as the driver so here is a really aggressive curve that the autopilot system will fail at and it does not fail so it did a great job there getting through that little t intersection here is a previous software test where it also was able to pass and did not require any driver disengagement so here is test number 14 where it's following a vehicle and I think following the vehicle helped it pass this test and lastly here is number 13 going through this same intersection where it did actually fail and required me to take over because it was heading for the side of the road so really impressive to see how smoothly in test number 16 it was able to take that intersection compared to some of the other previous tests not too many big Hills so we are going to speed up this section and you can see here in the test that there is no disengagement required and in previous tests I think the last five tests there was no gist dis engagements during this section now here we have a really aggressive kind of up and down left-hand sharp curve and let's see what happens the car slows down significantly again making a successful left curve okay now we have a right curve here and again the car goes down to 30 or 31 miles per hour making again a successful turn and finally the last curve coming up in this test before we go in the reverse direction now this one has caused problems with other software updates going into the curve it's maintaining that center lane position and does a phenomenal job there here's test number 15 you can see it got way over there to the right side of the road but I did not have to disengage here's test number 14 when it's following another vehicle and it was able to pass vs. test number 13 where it got way too fast and it was gonna go off the side of the road there so I did have to take over so really smooth here with 20 20 that's 16 2.1 in that it was slowing down significantly and maintaining that center lane position allowing the car to very accurately navigate that curve Oh okay here we go we're jumping right into the reverse direction so this was the last curve that you just saw in the reverse direction so here we go we're 32 miles an hour autopilot engaged and it is maintaining that center lane position and doing a great job there so really nice to see that super smooth the last software update I did have to take over and sorry I don't have the footage from the last software update in Reverse so we have a left Bend coming up here and so with the car is going to slow down significantly and so all these curves that we've seen here I'm gonna slow down and we're taking them in the reverse direction to see if autopilot although it did pass all those other curves I'm gonna see if they can pass it in the reverse direction so we here we have that slight bend to the right and it does do a phenomenal job so 20 2016 to top one is doing a great job thus far on this curvy country road test in the reverse direction and in a forward direction it already passed all of the curves of course except that one in the town that doesn't have properly painted yellow lines so here we go we are going still in the reverse direction we're gonna fast forward through this section of road because it is going rather straight and there's not too many difficult curves that the autopilot will fail on but we're gonna slow down again for this t intersection here because it has failed before in the reverse direction and you can see it started to get a little bit close to that double yellow line but I did not have to disengage and it did maintain proper lane position although I would liked it to see the autopilot keep the car more in the center of the lane like it does typically like you see here now this is sped up footage I'm going 35 miles an hour but it looks like I'm going to laugh a stir because I just sped it up because I wanted you still to be able to see all the roads and I just wanted to highlight the harder curves on this road and show you that it did not require any dis engagements so let's slow it down here we have a significant right-hand curve going down a slope here car is doing a great job keeping the car at a slower speed knowing that there's a curve coming up and 24 miles an hour was our bottom speed going through that right hand curve and that was phenomenal executed beautifully so really impressive in this 2020 8.16 2.1 I know I sound like a broken record but there are some huge autopilot improvements with this update so it's slowed down here we have a right Bend coming around to our really difficult curve here where we lose the double yellow line and we have to make a really sharp turn to the left here and I do have to disengage there before the car runs off the road because it's going way way too fast so we have a stop sign here I'm gonna turn on the turn signal but of course it does not support intersections yet we're turning at a stop sign so I do have to disengage because I get the message take over immediately so I'm going through this town here and now I push on the accelerator pedal or you can also pull down on the drive stock to acknowledge you saw where I went over that railroad track really cool to see autopilot system now identifying railroad lights as traffic lights and requiring you to acknowledge the same yes it does get a bit annoying you can see I disengage there and then re-engage autopilot some of the safety things that autopilot team has put in place like acknowledging at every single stop light or stop sign or keeping our cars limited to the speed limit on that road do get annoying but trust me they will pay off in the end when FSD software is ready for release I as always guys I'll see you in the next
