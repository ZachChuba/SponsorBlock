day and saved 20% via brilliant org slash vector I've been using Apple's new air pods Pro for about a week now I've gotten to talk with the product team warn them on a plane in coffee shops out walking about I've got a pretty good idea about the 10:00 audio cores in each ear fit and feel the comfort and controls the isolation and the transparency but to help me out with the sound I've once again gotten Lorri Gill managing editor of I more and literal rockstar on the line I'm Rene Richie and this is vector so ear pods Pro let's start off with the design I kind of like it they're a little bit more severe like the the stem is more tapered if I was going to make an analogy it would be the old air pods are the Imperial Stormtroopers and the new ones are more first-order or the old ones are the on the base stormtroopers and the new ones are the snow troopers like something like that yes yes yeah that way we can stay away from the prequel from the from the sequels in terms of design I think while they're I mean I know that there is a significant change in the design but really they'd look a lot like the old ones and I think from a marketing perspective it's a really good idea because people want air pods they want to look like they're wearing air pods they're iconic iconic and so for them to basically continue the same look with a slight adjustment I think it's a great idea they I think that they're actually designed slightly different to accommodate the new features not to be a completely different design change yeah because of the system in package they can now get more of the components into the actual bud meaning they don't need as much of a stem but they're keeping it around for that handy-dandy yeah the force sensor which is the fourth page which is a great new feature that I really do appreciate and you're right they could have just made it a bud but I think giving us some physical controls was a really good idea instead of trying to tap your ear which has always felt a little bit uncomfortable it just you're just tapping on your ear and this is a better way to do it yeah and it's painful if I do it on there but it just hurts it's I don't want to do that alright so what do you think about the part of it the tips part of it because we've had those before but usually they go over a plastic stem and Apple has mounted these flush so you can pull them off and you can snap them back on but they're letting the entire silicon part of it sort of mush and mold into your ear if that's what they have to do so from my personal perspective it is absolutely a wonderful new design and I am all on board with it I think it feels great and it works great for me so let's get into the comfort aspect then I've been wearing these because you and I have had endless meetings before right now I've been wearing these for about three hours four hours now and I can feel that they're there which is something I didn't really ever feel with the other air pods because they don't actually go into your ear they're sort of just inside the they're not on ear but they're sort of on in-ear and these are in in-ear so I can feel them more but they don't bother me I know what you mean when I first put them in my ear they're very light they don't touch anything they're they're just kind of like this thing that barely sits there but if anybody experienced pain with air pods that was the real problem with them is that though they felt lightweight they eventually started hurting the cartilage around your ear so with ear pods Pro because of the silicon tip I now no longer feel any any feeling of pain from from the hard plastic of the air pods I only feel the soft mushy tip of the silicon tip yeah and Apple said they took the thousands of scans that they got from the original ear pods the old wired ear pods they did thousands of additional scans from people all around the world to have a greater variety of ear models to work with and then they made a heat map so they could tell where were the areas that were less comfortable like the cartilage that you mentioned but also the ones that added was the added stability so they could make a much better sort of design for them I find these stay in better for me than the original ear pods which stayed in better than pretty much any other in-ear headphones I've ever used previously with these standard air pods I've said this before the left one would stay in fine but the right one would fall out these the left one stays in really really well and the white the right one stays in pretty well if I'm talking a lot or chewing a lot it'll start to worm its way out and I'll just have to push it back in like once every 3 or 4 min the left one maybe I'll adjust once every 10 minutes but I think for like walking for doing stuff like this they're great I think for like hardcore workouts though I would still go with the power B yes so that definitely I can give you a good example when I wear air pods in my ears I I would have to actually put my hair back because my hair would start to get like kind of in the way and all I had to do is this and an air pod would fall out of my ear oh is it was really like I've worried a lot so I would just start to wear my hair back in order to avoid that that does not happen with AER pots Pro they're solidly in my ear so that nothing I do they don't even start to slip out for me Russell Holly brighter for I more wrote a wonderful review of jogging a4k with him in his ears and he noted that it took my I'm about 3/4 of his jog before he started feeling like that they were starting to slip and add about 3/4 he said he did end up having to start pushing them back into his ear I think three times total for the entire jog so I do think that in terms of working out all that jostling and especially all that sweating the earhook of the power beats Pro is what keeps them solidly in your ear which makes for a better form factor in that way yeah yes if you're gonna parkour definitely use that but I also like these are our sweat and rain resistance and I've been walking in the rain quite a lot and I have a hood on but it still makes me feel more comfortable that I don't have to worry about you know relatively expensive ear pause just fizzling out because they get a like drizzle on them right I'm certainly less nervous about getting any kind of liquid on them at all yeah the other thing is they still have that awesome setup experience which i think is really the killer feature of the air pods anyone familiar with the first generation ones it's essentially the same the animation is a little bit longer because they describe more features but you turn on your phone the thing pops up at the bottom you tap connect and you're essentially done and on the Mac it's them it's the menu bar the Apple watch just picks up for standard bluetooth stuff you do have to still pair them like standard Bluetooth devices but it's still for me the best setup process in the business when you pair them with first device with your iPhone let's say and then you can just walk over to any one of your other devices my best experience was when I was testing him out I was watching a movie on Apple TV and I just thought oh I'm just gonna switch over and I thought oh I hope I hope it's paired I hope it's there so I do the swipe down while the movies still playing air pods pros showed up right in the menu and I just clicked on that and they immediately went to my ear I didn't have to do anything to get to the point where those were connected to the TV same thing with Macs same thing with iPad being able to just immediately it's already there you just have to click on it to connect it is such a pleasant experience I don't ever want to use any other kind of Bluetooth headphones again they all need to have an h1 chip for me just because the simplicity of being able to have all of my devices connected is fantastic so this is the part where I really have to lean on you though and that's the sound quality I've watched a bunch of reviews from a bunch of different people who all call themselves audio files I have never caught the audio philia I'm not a Golden Ears I'm more like a 10 ears so they sound good to me they sound better than air paws to me but what's your take on the sound so yeah they're definitely better than air pods I actually did a pretty deep dive testing of them where I listen to the same song over and over again so that I could listen amongst the different headphones that I have the the let's do a quick sort of simile comparison here air pods to me sound like I'm listening to a band in a tin can it's all client it's all high everything is high as I can tell that they're trying to bring in the mids and lows but to me that also sounds it sounds like faked mids and lows it there's definitely a difference there that it doesn't sound natural and warm air pods Pro it sounds like I'm listening to a song where somebody put a blanket inside the kick drum so it's warmer it's thicker but it's still a little muffled it's still kind of it it sort of clips at that mid so you don't get that like thick robust bassy sound when you're trying to listen to music that has bass to it otherwise it's very balanced it's it's more balanced too than the air pods absolutely it does not have the high end it has a very standard middle of the grille of the road thing which which can be a little bit disappointing when you're listening to music that you really want to feel it kick in it doesn't quite have that kick in with something like power beats Pro for example I really feel that bass when it comes up it hits me and it like brings in that that heavy sound that I'm looking for so it in terms of balance it's great but in terms of its ability to really still bring that that high quality audio that you're looking for it's still missing it it still has the air pods still have a ways to go before they can give us something like that so my feeling is if you value the convenience as much as the sound if you if you care about the total package then just the ability to have air pods with you all the time put them in pair them super easily that's the selling feature here but if you really do care desperately about the highest end audio quality you're still better off with those big cans that's the two things you get your air pods Pro or you get a pair of cans like maybe the studio three or something like that or even the studio Pro actually would be a better a better type of headphones that you'd want to use in terms of in-ear earbuds and how air Potts Pro compared to other in ear earbuds that I've tried they they're they're probably something more like a bee compared to what an a would be so they're they're close but they don't quite hit that mark in terms of just audio quality but all of the other things that go along with having air pods Pro make them absolutely 100 percent better I personally am of the opinion if I want to listen to that really warm clear deep robust sound I'm not gonna put it in my ears I'm gonna put on a record and I'm gonna listen to it in my full stereo if I want portability I want ear pods Pro because they let me take that music anywhere I go and maybe it doesn't meet my standards 100% but it meets it about 80% and all the other things that gives me meet it at 100% which makes it worth it in the mobile sphere so have you had a chance to try out the mic yet I've been doing some tests and I'm actually recording this video on the air pods as well as with the fancy shotgun mic so I'm gonna cut this segment in entirely with the air pods mic so people can hear the difference it sounds to me about the same as the air pods mic I know the stems don't come down quite as far but Apple is doing some beamforming to try to isolate your voice anyway but no one I've spoken to is complained on call they've all thought it sounded fine I think everyone will say that the actual phone mics are better because they're they're better mics but this this seems utterly serviceable which sounds like I'm damning it with faint praise but I mean that sort of a good way no yes so it really just comes down to like what the technology can do and like beamforming microphones are it's an impressive ability to round itself around your face and know and know that it needs to capture that audio that comes from your mouth while cutting out a lot of the ambient sound around you you know if there's a car driving by if there's a bus driving by this doesn't pick it up very loud so the person talking to me they can hear me even though that bus is driving by and at the same time because of noise cancelling I can hear them when they're talking while that bus is driving by so it works on both ends all right so let's get into the noise cancelling and that's the one of the big marquee features of the air pods Pro I'm not the biggest fan of noise cancelling because I find it kind of like I'm stuck in a little tiny box and I don't mind I'm pretty good at concentrating through ambient noise so I don't mind it as much I did have a chance to test it in New York on curbside you know little curbside cafes on the airplane on my trip back I've gone to coffee shops we had 106 kilometers a year last week and the whole place was rattling and I put it in and it completely got rid of it so for me it works really really well I can't say again it works as well as the big over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones but for buds and i come from the bose wired not the wireless but the bose wired but to me it was it was fine it was really really good yeah I think again if you're gonna compare in-ear earbuds with over-the-air or on air cans and and talk about noise cancelling you're really kind of you're talking about two completely different things what I think Apple excels at is isolating this sound noise canceling without you feeling like like oh that's exactly what you're saying that it it doesn't it actually feels a lot more natural to have them in and to be walking around I hear myself a little bit stronger than I want to it's almost like putting earplugs in and I can hear my own sound reverberating inside but it it otherwise feels a lot more comfortable than other noise cancelling headphones I've I've had yeah I think the vent really helps they have these vents on the outside that so you don't feel like you're sort of plugged up which you do with some headphones and also they have this transparency mode where you can you can do the forced pinch and turn on transparency mode and then the external mic picks up the outside the ambient noise and gives it back to you but it doesn't sound like you're not wearing the headphones it doesn't even sound like turning noise canceling off it's almost crispier than reality I know some people called it augmented reality but it's not actually adding any data to it it's just sort of filtering everything I've you have tested a couple of noise cancelling headphones that do have their version of transparency whatever they will call it and to me those always sounded almost like somebody was sticking a microphone out everywhere and picking it up so it was drawing in a lot of ambient zone that I felt was to mess with earpods Pro it's more like it's more like it just opened up a little spot in your ear to allow audio to come through so that you're still your music and your your you know audiobooks your podcast they're still loud and clear but you somehow are able to hear you know if somebody knocks on your front door or something like that without it feeling like like a watch like with with other noise cancelling headphones that have this kind of feature it goes like this with these that doesn't happen so it you can run this test you can open up Bluetooth settings which I still think is an odd place to have all this I'd much rather there was like an air pods a persistent ear pods tab but you can go into bluetooth your air pods Pro and you can run a sound tip test and that'll tell you if there's a good enough seal to do all the fancy noise canceling stuff and I passed the seal with default the default medium-size tips on it but they didn't feel like they were staying in my ear really well so I tried the bigger ones I tried the smaller ones and now I have the smaller ones in and they fit much better so just recommend that people even if they pass the test they still take the time to try all the different tips right because the tip test is not to determine if it's comfortable it's to determine whether or not you have a good seal so I was the same way I passed the tip to test with the medium pair but I knew medium is not going to be great for my ears I took them out right away and I tip tested with small thank goodness it was a good seal and that's what I use in my ears the small size because it gives me a good seal and they're comfortable so I completely agree when you do that tip test don't assume that it's saying this is the right pair for you all it's saying is this does give you a good seal make sure that either the large or small isn't a better fit in terms of comfort so to control this you can either do that force pinch on the stem you can use control center on your iPhone on your Apple watch the menu bar on your Mac the Bluetooth controls on other devices how intuitive and easy did you find just controlling your air pods in general at first it was so bad that I thought I might have a bad pair I couldn't get it to work at first but after a little bit of playing around with it I've figured out exactly how to do it right and I say this for two reasons one once I figured it out it's absolutely fantastic but two I was surprised that Apple didn't do a better job of designing it with au an interface that was better for users they're great at that Apple is great at user interface that is makes sense and is understandable and easy to use and I was a little surprised that it took me probably a day of playing around with it and you know pinching it in different places and Rene even getting a recommendation from you about the best way to do it before it finally clicked on my head how to do it now it's worth it's perfect it works right every time but surprisingly I think Apple probably could have done a little better job at designing that interface on the on the touch sensor so that it's just it just happens it just works it didn't just work ya can't go wrong yeah and also you can use Siri which I've actually used several times now because they have onboard Siri like the air pods - and the the answer right away so I'll just say transparency mode or I'll say something else and it works and I walk around the house just telling it to do stuff now you know like I keep saying this but it's true like just play it turn on the Apple TV play this on the Apple TV turn off this do that and it's like no I don't have to yell at my home pod you know I can be in a completely different room and just whisper and all it what happens right I I find myself turning the light on and off in my bedroom a lot because I'll be in there with the air pods Pro in my ear and just think oh I need to turn the light on and then I'll just have Siri do it like that's so great I didn't have to go get my phone or any or do anything on my watch it just automatically just happens it's such a great feeling to just have your air pods be the Siri that you need to do everything it's it's really great it's a great experience so a battery life now the standard air pods get like five hours these get five hours without noise cancelling on four and a half hours with noise cancelling or transparency on and I often wear just one unless I really want that noise canceling experience I'm listening to audiobooks or podcasts only put one on which means I can just switch back and forth basically indefinitely and plug in the case but I did make deliberate test here and I'm getting around four and a half hours I think slightly longer than what Apple originally said yeah I think I I experienced the same thing out nose canceling I kept them in my ears for four and a half hours I went for it and I think it was the same it was like four hours 45 I think is that I managed to keep it in that lower you know I've managed the to keep the battery that long so without a doubt their their judgment on how long nose canceling works is it's dead-on you're you're not gonna you know discover that it was only three and a half hours or four hours it it hits that four and a half hour mark plus in terms of the case I haven't actually let the case completely run down so bottom line Laurie Gill what is your recommendation with the with the air pods Pro if you have been waiting around for a more comfortable pair of pods go by right now they are absolutely the most comfortable pair of air pots in the world in all existence and I'm so happy that I finally can wear air pods that are comfortable it makes me so happy they're even more comfortable to me than the power beats Pro which have been my favorite in the ear earphones for a long time now if you already have air pods and you you don't you know don't need anything they don't hurt your ears you're fine with what you've got they up this it's an expensive upgrade just to add noise cancelling to it so if you're not really just I have to have noise canceling your air pods are fine if you are if you have another pair of in-ear noise cancelling headphones that you really love this the audio quality of this one it might be a disappointment for you so maybe test them out first try the audio to just to determine whether or not you think it's a different if the difference is good enough but I can I can definitely say these are I I want to wipe all of my other headphones cans over the ear on ear including my power beats Pro I want to throw them out in the garbage now just because of how comfortable and easy to use ear pods Pro are I finally have a pair of ear pods that are comfortable fit and they sound good and and they look good and all that stuff so up I it's a win-win for me I'm very very happy with it yeah the thing that I will always about air paws before if you come at them from an audio point of view you're sort of setting yourself up for a disappointment and I don't mean that by saying that Apple deserves a pass on the sound not being the best sound in the universe because I think absolutely Apple should absolutely attempt try for continue to progress towards the best sound in the universe but what you're getting and what you're paying for are these little computational ear computers and when you look at the price and say well $249 is expensive for that sound or when you listen to them and say well they don't sound as good as this or that again it's the silicon the sensors it's all the things that go into them to make them so much more than just raw drivers outputting sound and if that's meaningless to you if you could care less about how easy they setup and pair and switch between devices or that they stop playing when you put them in or out or that they can't range mode you squeeze if you could care less about any of those things just get the best sounding headphones you can get whether they're custom-made in-ear earphones like Jim Dalrymple or they are giant cans that give you the best you know studio level sound when you want them but if you do value the convenience stuff if you do value the instant pairing and the changing and all of those things that are driven by tiny little computers in your ears and you want to extend the sound quality is acceptable to you then I think these are the best in ear headphones ever made and they're certainly to echo what Laurie said they're gonna be the ones that I'm wearing going forward you can find Laurie Gill at Apple holic on twitter and at
