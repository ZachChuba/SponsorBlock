What's that? This is so cliche! I know what you are doing! Where are you? Come on! We have done already done this prank bro What! What the heck were you doing there? I am replaced with the third member of our team Hello Yolo people there!
Yolo Comics! Guess you guys have watched the previous prank, 
the stealing automobile components prank If you have not watched it yet, 
please make sure to watch it In the previous episode, we placed a manikin under a car to make people believe that it's for a real person! But this time, I will be replaced with a manikin and wait for people laying under a car to make people freak out! Let's see how would they react to seeing him? Let's get started now! We are in front of Hyung Min's house now (So excited!) We was so freak out from the previous episode How would he react to seeing my under a car 
instead of finding out a manikin Let's see how he would react! (We've already asked Seung-Woo for his help to prank to Hyung-Min together) Hello? - Are you guys going to have a meeting tomorrow?
- Yes, we are going to have a meeting - What time it would be?
- The meeting is going to be at 2pm - Where would that be?
- Going to have it at Gang-Seo district We are thinking to come up with another
 prank to Hyung-Min - What would that be?
- Do you remember the stealing auto component prank? - I'm thinking to try it again 
- Oh really? He catches things really fast 
Are you sure you want to try the same prank again? But this time Yolo will be under a car instead of placing a fake manikin He might think that would be a fake manikin That's why!
That's why Yolo Park will be under a car this time - I think that is a such good idea 
- If something changes or he's not going to be at a home - Please contact me asap 
- Don't worry - Thank you so much!
- See you soon! We are back here again before the target is going to his schedule Let's get started the prank as the target comes out He will be shocked for sure! (Yolo Choong-Ho)
(Yolo Park) (Waiting for the target until he comes out) (Are you okay down there?) I'm fine When would he come out? He's here! Is he? (He's finally coming!) (Let's get started!) (Same pattern as the previous prank) (What's going on..?) Use this one (That's my car) (What the heck are they doing?) (I get it!)
(You guys must be Yolos!) Hey! Hurry up! You don't have to be hurry (What are you doing at here?) (Yolo Choong-Ho is intentionally running away) What the heck are you doing! (Why is he running away since I know who you are) (What the heck is he doing?) (The target is speechless)
(That's the same thing has happened before) You guys underestimate me for sure! (He is running away so obviously) Why are you doing the same prank cam? Bro! (What does he want me to do?) What thing has been changed from the previous prank cam? The shape of the manikin? Is it? I'm going to tear this manikin apart! (Go....going to tear my leg apart?) Come back here faster!
Going to tear this apart! Scissor is here!
I'm going to tear this apart with the scissor! (You are not coming as you see this?) If you don't come back, I will tear this apart! Alright! I will! Let me tear this manikin apart! SHIT! WHAT THE HECK IS THIS! Let me tear this apart! SHIT! OH MY GOD! FXXX (He's literally spitting everywhere) WHAT THE HECK IS THIS! OH SHIT! - If you don't come back, I will tear this apart!
- (Is...he going to tear me apart?) Let me take this body apart! SHIT! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?! (Look at him lol) What were you thinking?
You were going to tear me apart? (The target is wandering around) - What was that?
- (Yolo Park gets hurt as he was being dragged out) I got hurt! (Anyway the prank success!) What's going on? Were you going to tear me apart with the scissor? What were you thinking if I got really hurt you with the scissor! - That's why I came out in hurry 
- What would you do if I got really hurt him! Weren't you scared?
Was he really going to hurt you? I made out quickly because I was so afraid You are so creepy! Why? That was so close! 
I had almost got hurt him but he did not come! He was just watching at you with the distance! You jerk! I didn't hear what he was telling me clearly You were clearly looking at me You bastard! - You should have come when I was warning you!
- I did not really know what was happening You were supposed to be near by me! The leg was raised. I thought that was the only difference from the previous episode I was wondering you guys came back with only this change or is this whole different prank cam? I doubted whether the manikin has been changed with a new one but I didn't realize that this is a real human I had no idea this would be a Yolo bastard You should have come out as I was calling you for Yolo Park's sake Believe me 
I didn't hear what you were saying! I know you want to make some drama to raise the number of view (I come clean!) I'm in hurry
Seung-Woo is waiting for me What?
Is Seung-Woo conspired with you guys again? You catch the things real fast! The next target is "Hyun-Woo Hong" We had no idea how to get him out because the writer who has helped us last time had quit her job We were wondering how we can call him out There is no one could help us so we decide to make a direct call to him I know it's too obvious but we are going to
 make a direct call (Calling) Hello? (Too obvious) Are you the owner of this car? My apology 
I made some scratches on your car while I was parking Can you come out to see your car for second? Choong-Ho, I'm warning you 
I'm going to smash your face! I'm really sorry
Please come out and check your car for second - Are you down here?
- (Ignoring) I'm sorry sir (Let's get prepared in hurry!) (Let's make it intentionally obvious) I've got nothing to say (Yolo are acting too obviously) What the heck are you doing? - What are you doing?
- Move fast! Come back here fast! Why are you doing this to me again?
You did exactly same thing to me (What on earth with this...?) (The manikin again) I've watched this prank cam already! Come back faster! Gosh...I'm done What the heck are you doing? I know this is a manikin!
I've already watched the prank cam on your channel I also subscribe your channel (Yolo CH is taking out his attention) - I know what this is about 
- This is the different one you've been fooled by This is exactly same from the one that I've watched! You watched it already? (Watch out!) (This is a big vow to you) (Vowing to Yolo Park) (From Yolo Park's view) (Look at his face) (He thinks this is funny too) What was that? Did you hear what he just said? He told me that he has already watched this prank cam! (He's howling lol) I could not stand on foot 
I'm speechless I was too surprised that I could not stand on foot Oops Where is my cell phone?
God! It's safe My hand phone was in the pocket You are insane What made you get in here 
It's very dirty A manikin is supposed to be in here not you This is a new prank cam?
Don't do such experiment to me - Stop doing this 
- Put down the scissor first (He's a good listener) - You are such a coward 
- I'm not a coward! - You are not a coward?
- I'm not! Let's rewind the video The target is giving a big vow as he freaks out I was watching right in front of you - You are such a big coward 
- Why didn't you place a manikin instead of him? You wouldn't have not believed in the prank if we had placed a manikin I was not expected this We are off 
Bye (You Yolos...) - Recently...Watch this for sec Watch what? I've had a car accident recently You see this scratch? You are such a horrible driver You know that this wan't by us Of course you did not 
(You are such a fraud) If you were hiding at here, 
I'm going to frame you for sure (Such a relief) (I'm leaving now) (This coward seems to miss out something) Success! The next target is Sun-MiN Lee Thanks to him, his car is parked right at here (We've already made a plan with 
a friend of today's target) (Calling a friend of today's target) (A friend of today's target is coming) - Is that his car?
- Yes right We need time to get prepared Please buy us some time to get prepared Make the target out of the office after 10 mins A prank cam is always so excited 
if you are not a target of it (Nice smile :) This is time given for you to revenge on him for the last prank cam - Thank you for the chance 
- You can just watch the things going to happen (Let's get started the prank since we can't drag time further) United! Let's make it! (The prank cam gets started after being set up) (He's coming) Hurry up! (Yolos!) Run!! (Yolo Choong Ho is running real fast) (The target is having doubts in his friend) (You idiot!) How did they come here? (You've contacted him?) - (I have no idea)
- (You bastard!) (I seriously have no idea) Yolo! (He has no words to say) What made them to think of doing the
 same prank cam to me? Yolo! I'm sorry but this prank cam wouldn't go success Yolo!
I'm sorry but you are screwed up! (He's trying to make something fun) Let's throw this manikin away I'm going to throw this away if you don't come back now (Why isn't he not coming back?) (My precious new car) (Let's drag this out first) (Hold tight) (!@#!@$!@$) (He's walking backward about 2M all of a sudden) (Hold tight) GORILLA S U N M I N (The gorilla is howling) (Nice B-Boying) (This is so funny) (I don't know what is he saying) (This is just funny) (The gorilla is howling) (The gorilla freaks out) (Awkward smiling) (I'm done) (I'm used toe be an athlete) (I can't believe that I'm fooled again) You see this is so excited? (He's trying to act like nothing has happened) We just come by here to see your new car (He has hot his new car only for a week) What a nice!
You have a new car and open your office too I was wondering why you guys have 
prepared the same prank cam I have never expected this You guys are so annoying How could I possibly think of this? Did you really think this is a manikin? I couldn't understand because it's too cliche What made you be fooled by this cliche then? I couldn't help myself because you got me You were so awkward I had doubts in him (You did really good job!) He was so relaxed 
That's why it was so funny He said "I'm so sorry because you failed this prank cam~" (We think this prank cam is success) Oh really? I had no idea you guys came up with 
a whole new prank cam You've got a special trick An alive gorilla What would you do if a gorilla has watched this prank ? You look like a real gorilla since the background is covered with greens You look like a wild gorilla This is success while celebrating his new car too!
