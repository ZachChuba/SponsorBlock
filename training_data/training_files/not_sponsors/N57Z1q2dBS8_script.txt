i have a secret to tell you all right what is it i haven't seen much of your stream i know i know i i learned that when i raid in you're like who the [ __ ] is this guy i'm sorry i'm sorry [Music] uh hey there hello hello um who are you you just cut out it sounded like you asked who i was was that the thing who are you that's a ridiculous question i am one of the top gamers one of the first gamers to ever pick up the sticks actor hunger games you probably know me from also officer greg in a horror movie coming up world renowned singer songwriter musician really it's a laundry list of things honestly yeah the whole show going through it oh my god you are so famous it's actually a burden honestly i can't go outside without sun panties being tossed at me mr mr what's your name again charlie or charles officer greg if you want to be more formal really whatever you're feeling greg charlie so um your viewers are well your viewers wrote something on my face and i guess i have to ask you that what's a sky nuts it is a song from the gentlemen which is a musical project that i'm a part of with my boy troy it's a song about machines from the future powered by human semen and in their timeline they ran out of men to milk so they had to come back to the past to milk current generation men and hopefully not repeat the sins of their fathers and you know continue to power themselves [Music] so that's basically like the gist of it think terminator if instead of electricity it was nut oh interesting like like like nuts like almonds and and peanuts and that's pretty much where we were going right like almond milk you're trying to milk right basically okay mr charlie so your chat keeps telling me these lies okay that you collect dildo it's like i know like what the hell is that about right that'd be that'd be weird right yeah that would be super weird that you have this dildo collection that you're trying to compete with belle del feed yeah what a that'd be the undertaking of a madman i know that'll be crazy yeah yeah yeah that would be weird so i did a roundup pretty recently in dildos and like vibrators that kind of resemble dildos it's right around 43 or 44 depending on how wax you get with it and then for like moby huges i have two but i didn't bother counting like bondage kits and stuff so i have a lot of those as well what what's a movie huge it's a three foot 70 pound dildo well dildo's the wrong word because you can't use it so it's just like a three foot penis made out of silicone [Music] it was a great deal they were doing some kind of like holiday special yeah it was great usually a thousand bucks they were going for 6.51 i was like are you kidding me you're almost half off i know right like jesus is crazy um you have a you're you're in the cards right now you're into pokemon cards you're in the yu-gi-oh cards you're into [Music] yeah yeah yeah it's pretty cool right yeah so like what's going on with that have you gotten everything that you wanted we're getting there slowly but surely yeah i've got most of the most of the cards i've been searching for there's still a few that i'm missing but you know we'll get them one day it's just the thrill of the hunt what are you missing all of base set first ed which is the the white whale but that's so hard to find that's like hundreds of thousands of dollars for those cards unless you know somebody there's just no way i'm getting those oh just a white whale yeah pretty much figure speech what is that is that is that is that a pokemon card or what is that i'm really dumb when it comes to cards yeah so it's like uh well the white whale's not a pokemon card but the pursuit is like have you read moby dick no it's about captain ahab's quest to it's a metaphorical journey in fact it's not really about the whale it's more about you see captain ahab's chasing this this elusive whale a real bastard that old she just couldn't quite get a handle on it and it's all about his journey to capturing and finally completing that quest and that's similar to what i'm going through right now the white whale of course metaphorically being my pokemon collection that i'm searching for oh i see so i have a few pokemon cards you want to see i got some on my desk unfortunately i only got a bunch of this first edition charizards oh no yeah i know they they're like symbolists or something the japanese symbolist i just i don't know why but i just ended up with a bunch of these and this is really it's really unfortunate because oh it's just gross to look at i know it's disgusting i wanted some variety you know i wanted some magic cars some but all i got are these you know super apparently they're like symbolists and japanese and holographic and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah exactly who cares about that and apparently they are like mistakes on them oh yeah you have to be a real loser don't want those yeah exactly oh it just breaks my heart mr charlie yes sir tell me about so my mod did a little bit of a research and well he gave me a list of things that you are and it seems that you definitely have a really big resume um okay so it says you are a kickstarter crap connoisseur the number one reviewer of movies and games youtube niche hobbies addictions explore extra extra door in there wholesome dad creative videos extensive knowledge on anything related to sex and porn including directing one himself wait you directed what [Music] in the process of unfortunately the old pandemic shut down the porn production for a while but we're coming back the [ __ ] guard manor will see the light of day wait you direct the porn we wrote it yeah tell me more yeah i can talk about the first episode i've made that public so a porn company a while back asked if i'd be interested in writing porn with them and obviously i'm going to say yes i mean who would say no to an opportunity like that so i got my boys together jackson matt and danny and we started brainstorming we went right to the lab we were researching foreign non-stop and eventually came up with a premise that would be four episodes roughly like three hours long it's like the lord of the rings of porn and we wanted to make one that had a storyline that even if you took all of the sex out would still be an incredible movie so we wrote that and then the pandemic hit so it hasn't been able to be filmed yet the lord of the sea rays yeah pretty much well it's called the [ __ ] it rock hard manner the only thing i have in common with lord of the rings is its length which is like three and a half hours wow that's that is impressive mr boyce i i hope it gets i hope it gets made i'm still fingers crossed i can't tell you the story of how i got banned i want to hear everything leave no stone unturned okay so i have this feature okay called uh set if you send a dollar you can send nikko a d-pick okay so i have i have this phone right and chad can send me a d-pick by sending a dollar and a letter d would pop up on this phone okay in various sizes we could get 0.2 inches 9 inches like all sorts of these right yeah and then um and then twitch banned me for they thought that i was selling actual dick pics and they banned me for soliciting pornography i'm just surprised they gave you a reason for banning you i mean that's more than most people get uh that's actually the most shocking part of that story if i'm being honest did anyone tell you that you're kind of intimidating all the time it's my bulging muscularity and just absolutely disgusting stature i'm standing at a beautiful five foot six like going through doorways is oftentimes burdensome it's just massive shoulders popping through are you only five foot six did you say only i hear that it's cute okay cool yeah so we're on the same we've been intimidating and yeah oftentimes you'll have kids voiding their bowels when i come through it's like holy sh you know this is what happens when you eat your vegetables you can look like this adonis right it's just one of those am i what are you vegan no no no no are you sure well yeah yeah you look a little vegan well that's rough but that's all right it's it's okay yeah hassan is vegan that's true and he doesn't he doesn't look cute he looks like a man he looks like a he's like he's a pokemon man he's big man yeah big man why is your name moist critical oh i don't know i just always changed the name around i never really think to like make things connect so like instagram's big moist critical yeah i know it's that and then yeah and then you've got penguins yeah that one just penguin z zero zero why why is this why is it so confusing i can't yeah i know i know just charlie too and that's the weirdest one i i don't know well officer greg let's let's not mix words that one's as straightforward and beautiful as it gets i got into bitcoin like super early because my buddy was like charlie bitcoin is gonna be big and i was like i don't believe you so i'll get one and then it got huge so whoo did you at least what did you do with that one big one do you still have it well i still have it yeah that's like a little treasure now do you think it's gonna you think bitcoin is gonna be worth a lot i mean last i checked and i don't check very often anymore because it's just hurtful last i checked it was like 15k a bitcoin up again yeah it's wild holy [ __ ] so so my ex-boyfriend okay completely out of character again my ex-boyfriend has a got a bitcoin right and he had it in his old computer but his roommate spilled water oh yeah oh god it's so painful yeah that's the worst i actually like that guy who like the youtuber who bought two pizzas for a tutorial with 10 000 bitcoins in like 2014 i don't know how that man hasn't just thrown himself down the staircase oh god i wouldn't be able to i would never be able to sleep painful that is so painful it was for a youtube tutorial he spent like 10 000 bitcoins just to show that you can order a pizza with bitcoin and that's like 70 million dollars worth of bitcoin oh my god he i bet he's like he can't he can't sleep these days like no there's no one he's he's literally kicking his own balls well i mean i'm sure there's i'm sure he's got youtube subscribers though he stopped doing youtube that same year it's a dead channel he hasn't posted since it's this it's the saddest story on the internet i think is that g fuel in the back yeah we were stacking yu-gi-oh boxes on it last night we opened it opened 120 boxes so stacked who sponsors you uh really just g-fuel i don't do the only time i do sponsored stuff is when it's like me and my friends and it's because i want to make sure that they get paid for their work so i usually do it for like theories and stuff do you pay your mods i try to but a lot of times they don't want it that's a lie i've only heard like three times i'm trying to they're welcome to ask they're welcome to get paid i think they do great work but i i always feel weird asking i'm actually trying to force so i have a synth named jor right the tier three yeah he's a tier three stuff he's been here with me since july hasn't missed a single stream and um you know he's like uh he's a very loyal viewer and i'm just like i'm trying to pay him okay i'm trying to give him money but he just keeps refusing because like he says that all that money is just gonna be spent on me anyway so i'm trying to i'm trying i'm trying my best so that he can you know [Music] so this to confirm this is the same guy you said should be in my porn production because he's a virgin with a small yeah yeah so this man is enamored with the streams and you're still calling his wiener small ah that's that's that's a huge move right there miko i respect that hot sauce whip absolutely embarrassing what does that mean well i was born without the genetics to handle capsaicin which is the active component in hot sauces and peppers so when i get capsaicin my body just shuts down it goes into overdrive it's it's a disaster really wait you actually like it's like is it like an allergic reaction yeah it's a it's a medical condition it's uh out of my control is what it is are you just a [ __ ] no no no i believe the proper terminology is capsaicin intolerant [Music] so what is the proudest thing that you've done um to be honest i'm not someone that's super motivated by like numbers and stuff i just do things that are fun and make things that are fun as far as projects i've ever made i honestly probably say skynet skynut was a song that took us quite a few months to like iron out and then the animation from the studio it was over a year cooked up in the lab it was just a really cool experience and chat just brought up like my best gaming moment was when i played chess against xqc and scholars mated him in six moves that got my panties sodded like that was pretty wild you beat way you beat xuc and six moves yeah i'm surprised you didn't hear about it it was nationwide news i mean so i s so while i was looking into you i saw a video about it but i was like excuses uh you know so i so i didn't really watch it because you know xqc is just um but like that is awesome six moves six big ones right there six moves of pure jubilant genius oh can i show you my different um different characters i i'm all i'm all eyes here whatever you want to show okay so chad made these for me they've made me this dopey goat they think it looks kinda like adobe it's kind of cute right and then um this is well this is bing dong ko this is basically the penis oh and this is this is yeah let me the breasts are not shrinking this is this is hassan you see it yeah that's good i can yeah i can see it now and then this is okay this one's kind of terrifying this is sperm co and um oh wow yeah it's uh they were basically trying to make it look like sperm pretty yeah i mean that's a that's pretty close that looks like every sperm i've ever seen under a microscope wow and then not lastly but not least this is pencil pal and it's basically another rendition of the song but more um it's just that you can't really but i have it there's a head you see that oh little yeah right there like a little baby bird in its nest that's so cute yeah that's adorable it is cute right i think what you're doing is one of like the most technically impressive stuff like spoiler alert i've watched a lot of the streams so i know you also can like go from mocap to like the game world like in real time wait you've watched my stream oh a ton of them i know i think it's the coolest [ __ ] so i i've also seen the chat play with the titties until it's like the massive walking dick thing i've seen it all it's crazy i think it's the coolest deck have you seen my forest simulator yeah i've i've seen it it's great okay i have a secret i have a secret to tell you all right what is it i haven't seen much of your stream i know i know i i learned that when i raid and you're like who the [ __ ] is this guy i'm sorry i'm sorry no no hey would you be like would you be open to being a boss in my rpg absolutely yeah for sure can i speedy scan you yeah well i don't have to put like alge in it in my butthole or anything like that no no no no no no all i need are some pictures that's it okay it's not like pictures of like my butthole or anything right like it's still just like normal pictures i mean unless you want to become like i don't know penguin monster and this special attack is someone deep faked me onto a uh i think it was a ski hand job so it was a they photo well it was at the photoshop they deep faked my face on a girl giving like double hand jobs to two dudes so that's as close as i've been yet so we're not far off how did that make you feel for a second i thought it was me i was like what the [ __ ] did i do that and who was filming but afterwards i was like wow that's impressive did you keep the video no it's somewhere on the internet i don't know i'd have to find it again are you married no i do have a girlfriend though you should give it to her give her the video of me doing the dual hand jobs yeah i would just i'd probably just get in trouble for it she'd be like what the [ __ ] is this it's convincing she'd be like what the [ __ ] charlie mr penguin if you were in my rpg as a boss fight what would your special line be or a special attack be whoa i don't know i could i could have multiple phases right like one of them i'm tossing like pokemon cards and it's a ranged face kind of like a bullet hell yeah yeah yeah and then when you get up in close i could be like a like caveman so like in yakuza 7 where they have like a giant sledgehammer i could just like slamming down a moby huge for like aoe or something oh yeah there's a lot of there's a big move set in there am i allowed to have a moby dick on my stream uh cyberpunk like half the game is just a bunch of dicks in the world i think it's probably fine sometimes it's not pornographic as long as twitch tos said as long as it's not being no capped yeah i could have a dick mr charlie this was such a pleasure it was a lot of fun i really appreciate you having me on like i said i'm a huge fan of the show so i loved it i am a huge fan you
