it will be very hard to argue that as the 2010s come to a close any single artist has had a bigger impact on our culture than Kanye West and that's why I want this to be my very last worse - best of the year but let's be real Kanye is also pretty crazy he's arguably the greatest and most controversial artists of the last two decades which puts me in a weird place if I want to rank his music he's an erratic maniac and an enigmatic genius with a body of work more alive personal and intense than any other rapper in the history of the genre this is my ranking of his 11 major projects from weakest strongest and as someone who loves each and every one of Kanye's projects this is definitely the most difficult worse - best video I've made yet but before we get into it a brief word from our sponsor Kanye Wurstfest is brought to you by skill share click the link below to get two months of free tutorials on almost any creative business or tech subject you could think of coming in at 11th place cruel summer is basically the only kanye album you could possibly maybe consider bad sure it's not even technically a kanye album but he put his name all over the project and contributed to a majority of the songs and it just hasn't aged well they leaned way too hard on flexing as a songwriting technique and the production is pretty tacky I just don't see this album being remembered as an important piece of Kanye's catalog when albums like watch the throne released just one year earlier are such better examples of Kanye's ability to collaborate and have fun at the same time all the same songs like mercy of new god flow and don't like are very nostalgic for me and I consider them classics of their era and hip hop coming in a tenth place it doesn't make me happy to write Kanye's latest album at the bottom of this list instinctually my desire is for artists to grow as people throughout their careers continuously improving their craft with each passing release but that just wasn't the case with yet it came out after Kanye spent a period of around one year publicly advocating for the Trump administration and their policies position widely seen as ill-informed and childish many longtime kanye listeners found themselves unable to relate to or even respect the vulnerability that Kanye uncovered on yeh given his actions throughout the year leading up to the album's release and even besides all of that yeh just wasn't really good it was only 23 minutes long and despite its short running time Kanye managed to waste a significant amount of the album with unmemorable throwaway tracks like all mine and no mistakes that being said the songs I thought about killing you and ghost town are career highlights for Kanye overall I think yeh will go down as a late career misstep for Kanye and overly obvious yet somehow completely tone-deaf look into the mind of a man who potentially never even had it together in the first place [Music] again at ninth place it sucks to be working backwards here but the life of Pablo I'll admit is an extremely inconsistent album it listens like a combination of the late 2010 strap sound in the industrial sound feature on esis and unfortunately that combination of sounds ended up sounding pretty messy some of it is boring some of it is grating some of it is revelatory and spiritual to a degree Connie had never reached in his career before songs like ultralight beam father stretch my hands real friends wolves and Saint Pablo are amazing tracks that I think perfectly portrayed the inner and outer struggles that Kanye experienced as he matured over the last couple of years starting a family and taking a back seat in the music industry as his very own protegees began to eclipse him in popularity watch throne might be Kanye's most fond album he and jay-z came together to create a wildly indulgent celebration of their accomplishments and it went pretty well the songs were catchy topical and powerful from uplifting anthems of no church in the wild - amazing sample flips like The Wanted Oh dissen who could stop me the album was just an all-around a good time and I think it still sounds great today sure it's not a conceptual masterpiece like the rest of company's work but he and Jay have such a great chemistry it sounded at the casual joint mixtape between two of the greatest rappers to ever live youthful fun on a presidential budget the college dropout is for all intents and purposes a masterpiece Kanye burst onto the scene brimming with a loud personality catchy melodies and a lot to say unfortunately I just don't see this album as quite as good as the other records he dropped during the bear era it's a little unfocused and light on actual content it's a little unfocused and light on actual content that being said it's unbelievably genuine and listening to it and Tony 19 brings back the static feelings unlike any other Kanye project it's a little unfocused and light on actual content that being said it's unbelievably genuine and listening to it in 2019 brings back nostalgic feelings unlike any other Kanye project the college dropout is an excellent callback to an amazing bygone era in pop culture it's the album that started it all forgotten he discusses the struggle of the common man in a way that makes it somehow obvious he would eventually become the most beloved rapper of all time the college dropout stands in stark contrast to the darkness and struggle that Kanye would eventually touch on with his music in the 2010s it's optimistic and innocent sure but a classic all the same at 6th place Jesus is Kanye's hazy fever dream it marked the first time Kanye wasn't laser focused on some grandiose concept or idea the album is raw aggressive and passionate many people immediately called it a classic while others thought it was pretty trash while people didn't realize at first though was that Jesus wasn't really all that different from Kanye's previous work it was his third album in a row that was all about inner conflict and the restlessness of his artistry after 808 sin Dark Twisted Fantasy who was becoming a trend that Kanye was dissatisfied with mainstream approval while also reveling in it it's a dark distorted industrial masterpiece in which Kanye slowly gives in to his desires and vices and it's the last of its kind Kanye's first child was born the same week as the release of Jesus and ever since then he slowly moved away from this type of hedonistic art focusing more on spirituality family and his place in the world by fifth-place 808s and heartbreak is a very very good album it's easily one of Kanye's most influential it paved the way for a new era of hip hop with its dark painful songwriting it beats the album also marked a turning point in Kanye's career as he abandoned the teddy bear imagery and easy listening R&B style it awaits features not one explicit song as Kanye focused heavily on creating a singer/songwriter atmosphere on the project and it wasn't just for style points his mother had just died and he had ended a long-term relationship it was the darkest moment in his career so far and 808s reflects that in the years following the album Kanye's reputation slowly shifted away from wholesome R&B inspired rapper and he would never get that reputation back 808 is a cold heartbroken look at a man who had a spirit crushed by the premature death of his mother it's not easy listen and it changes continuity forever kids see ghosts is what yeh could have been the album is short and to the point it doesn't waste time it shows Kid Cudi and Kanye navigating their trauma and pain together slowly finding self-acceptance and inner peace over the course of the record the instrumentals on kids sea ghosts are also quite good presenting a mix of rock hip-hop that sounds fresh and interesting in the whole way through for some reason the chemistry of Cudi and Kanye cancels out their individual craziness and they were able to create an absolute masterpiece together they faced their issues head-on and find sanctuary together in their faith Kanye's fantastic verse on Cudi montage makes it one of the most socially conscious songs he'd ever made he describes the cycle of violence in America and asks for salvation from God the album as a whole is an emotional journey that most artists couldn't create in an hour and a half and it's only 23 minutes long Cudi and Kanye's singing sounds amazing their lyricism is back to highs they hadn't reached in almost a decade kid Seacoast's is a future classic at number three late registration presents a version of Kanye that I'll never know I wasn't even six years old when it came out but I love it anyway the melodies are more memorable than anything else Konya did before or after the beats are larger than life and Kanye's persona was both elevated and true to his roots the music is full of emotion it goes hard it's genuine songs like roses heard him say hey mama there's not much music I've ever heard more honest than that late registration shows the side of Kanye that disappeared into the void long ago it's beautiful music that'll go down in history as one of the best hip-hop albums of all time a fact that now as Kanye grows older crazier is both happy and sad at second place what can i really say about Dark Twisted Fantasy that hasn't been said already it's a massive album it assured in and defined the entirety of the last decade of music it features Kanye pulling out every trick he can possibly think of in an album with huge instrumentals a large cast of characters and elaborate arrangements but it's not perfect it's the Kanye's vision of what perfection should be it's powerful yes but it's still a flawed work of art but all the same Kanye changed music forever with this album he introduced rap to Indy heads and college students around the world it was his manifesto it was everything he wanted everyone to know about him and Seiken is a decree from the king of pop culture even the President of the United States was calling Kanye names what was he supposed to do but aim for timeless Dark Twisted Fantasy is Kanye's sergeant pepper's it's his dark side from me is rumors it's his rumours his pink moon his okay computer it's a manifesto of the world through his eyes but it's not his best work at first place graduation isn't very good compared to a lot of the albums on this list but I love it more than all of them and I think you should too it's the last thing Kanye would ever make before his world was turned upside down and he was totally consumed by undiagnosed mental illness as a result graduation is a beautiful innocent look into Kanye's mind it's light and it moves with a sense of optimism and accomplishment unmark Aigner to his needs looking back on graduation is like looking at the calm before the storm it's a beautiful moment in time that I think in the end is honestly more powerful than anything you would make after the simple fact that graduation carries a sense of freedom no baggage just Kanye's hopes and dreams when we look back on Kanye in 100 years I think graduation will be remembered as one of the most important moments of Kanye's artistic career so that was Kanye's worst best thank you for watching and please stay tuned for some very special videos coming to celebrate the end of this wonderful
