today we're going to make a simple steamed banana sponge pudding [Music] so my ingredients for this are one ripe banana one heaped cup of self-raising flour three quarters of a cup of sugar i'm using caster sugar here but you could use soft brown sugar you can use granulated sugar if at a push but caster sugar combines more easily one cup of butter or soft baking spread two eggs some golden syrup or if you can't get that honey or any other kind of thick sugar syrup you can get maybe coconut syrup would work really well with this actually but that's the kind of consistency of syrup you're looking for this is golden syrup it's a thing we have in the uk and then we're going to serve that with custard which is going to be made from milk and vanilla extract i've got vanilla extract here you could use vanilla pods if you prefer and a cup and a half of milk so let's get started oh yeah just to just also to mention we're going to be flavoring this with cinnamon a little bit of star anise and nutmeg but you could use any spices you want in there so i've discovered that these nutella glasses are the same size as a measuring cup which is handy and i've prepared a bowl and i just made sure this is the right size by tipping it needs to contain at least three cups of liquid so i've tipped three cups of water in there just to measure that this bowl is the right size i'm not keeping that water it's just for the purposes of measuring in fact we need to dry that out now and it needs to be something that's heat proof because we're going to stand this in boiling water when it's covered and we're going to steam it that way so you could use a ceramic one like this you could use a metal basin you could use a oven proof glass type of basin but it needs to be heat proof so we also need a nice bowl for mixing it all up in so we're going to start by combining the butter with the sugar so we're just going to mash that together until until it forms a nice smooth paste this is a bit tricky if this has come straight out the fridge if your butter is warm it will combine better you can actually use vegetable oil in a recipe like this instead of butter you could just use a cup of vegetable oil and you could you won't have any trouble mixing that with the sugar and flour so we're just going to cream that together after a little bit of stirring and mashing it does start to come together there it goes just beat those together until they're properly mixed that's what we were aiming for that's good okay now eggs i'm gonna use one egg plus the white of one egg in here and i'm gonna reserve the yolk for making the custard so that essentially means we have two chances at separating this egg which is good so i'm just gonna i'm gonna crack it with a knife so that it comes neatly into two halves and the way to do that is we'll do that over a glass in this case and i just want the egg white from this one and so i'm just gonna pass that yolk back and forth between the two halves of the shell and kind of spill out the white while i go that's good okay so we've got a separated egg yolk right there which i will just put in a small dish and set aside for now so that egg white plus the whole of this egg into our cake mix and then we're just gonna blend that together and again it's a little bit difficult at first just go gently at first so it doesn't splash out and after a while those things will start to combine into a smooth mixture and we keep beating that with a wooden spoon until we can't see any lumps or texture okay that's good enough so now we're just going to mash up this banana it's a nice ripe one so it should break up very readily oh it smells good so just going to mash that up at the back of a fork make sure we've got no large lumps of banana and then that also goes into the mixture okay now for the spices you can really go as subtle or as bold as you want but i want to go for something that's fairly subtle and balanced so i've got a tiny little pinch probably less than that tiny little pinch of star anise same tiny little pinch of cinnamon and a little grind of nutmeg obviously if you've got ground nutmeg you can use that are you i have fresh so it's good i'll just mix that in first and now the flour so we'll just add that a little bit at a time stirring in as we go that looks good right now i'm going to prepare the pudding basin and for this we're just going to take a little bit of butter and rub it around the inside of the dish it's particularly important on the sides here because we want it to release once it's baked put a little bit in the bottom as well but most important is round the sides okay wash hands so now we're gonna put the pudding into the basin but first we'll have a nice generous squirt i suppose this is going to be a couple of tablespoons of syrup in the bottom you can use honey if you want it will taste of honey obviously but that's not a bad thing so yeah just enough syrup to cover the bottom of the dish like that then the pudding mix cake mix goes straight on top gonna kind of get it in there fast or else it will push the syrup up the sides okay now you don't need to worry too much about leveling this it will level itself as it cooks let's just have a taste of that batter and that tastes good feel free to jump straight down to the comments and tell me i'm eating roy and i will stop doing that as soon as i can right so we've got to put that in a steamer now but we can't just put it in like that so we're going to have a piece of baking parchment over that greaseproof paper waxed paper whatever you got for covering that and then a piece of foil as well now we're going to secure all of that in place with a bit of string and the easiest way i've found of doing that is make a loop at one end just like that but leave a tail on there like that and then just kind of push that down gather it we pass the string through the loop like that to create a slipknot type of put loop over the dish and then we can pull it tight make sure it's not too far down and make sure we haven't missed any bits of foil or paper around the edge this is the tricky part probably the trickiest part of the entire recipe right now this that's the tail end off the initial loop and then we just go back around again and then we can tie these two ends together nice and tight this is the part where it really helps if you've got a second person to put their finger on that knot while you tie the second knot but you can do it yourself if there's just the one of you just like that okay so now we'll just pick up that foil and paper so it's not dangling down the bottom in fact what we can do is just trim off some excess here and the same at the other side and that is ready to be steamed okay over here i've got my largest pan on a rolling boil with just enough water so that when i put this basin in it will submerge about two thirds of the way up so just to make it easier to drop in i fashioned a little handle out of string but we'll be very careful here because it's boiling water okay i'm gonna put that in there like that so the water level is only about two thirds of the way up that bowl it mustn't come up to the top or else it will spill inside the cake and just make it all watery lid on we'll turn that down so it's just a gentle boil and we're going to set a timer for an hour but we're going to check every 20 minutes just to make sure that water hasn't boiled away and if the water is getting a bit low we'll just top it out from the kettle so i'm going to move that to the back burner now because i want to make the custard okay now the custard we're going to make today is going to be a corn flour and egg custard you can make custard with just egg yolks and cream and sugar we're going to be using milk and egg yolks and corn flour corn starch and sugar so the reason for using cornstarch instead of egg yolks to thicken our custard is just simplicity it's actually a lot easier to make this custard but also it's a lot of egg yolks and this is a bit of an economy thing as well so into the glass that's got about a tablespoon and a half of white sugar we're going to put two teaspoons full of cornstarch then we're going to take a little bit of the milk from there and just combine that together you need to do that with just a tiny bit of milk if you use too much it will create lumps and it won't combine and then we need a whisk because we're going to put the egg yolk into the milk oops mess we're going to put a few drops of vanilla extract in there [Music] and whisk together and then we're going to put this sugar and cornstarch mixture in and whisk that in too now chances are there's a bunch of british people scratching their heads and looking at me right now saying why are you doing it that way why don't you just use custard powder well mainly because i'm making this recipe for people who don't have access to custard powder custard powder is just cornstarch yellow coloring and vanilla flavoring so we're doing this the hard way because i want this recipe to be accessible to people who don't have custard powder in their country anyway that's all whisked together now so we're gonna get that in a pan and gently heat it so over here in a milk pan what a lovely handle we're going to put in that custard mixture and we're just going to warm it over gentle heat whisking as we go it's important to keep this moving because otherwise it will just burn on the bottom of the pan now this custard will be a bit paler than usual because i haven't added any yellow coloring and there's only one egg yolk in there normally custard powder has some anato in there to give it a yellow color or artificial yellow color sometimes i can feel this starting to thicken now as i'm whisking it and that's important to keep it moving and stop it burning on the bottom of the pan while it thickens now if you want the custard hot over the syrup sponge then obviously you would prepare this right at the last minute but it will stand and it will be it can be reheated if necessary and it's thickening up now and it this happens quite suddenly as it comes up to near the boiling point of the milk it's worth turning the heat down just a little bit so you don't scald it or burn it but we can see now that's thickening quite considerably now if it doesn't thicken you can mix up some more cornstarch and water or cornstarch and milk just a little bit and add small amounts until it does thicken so if you've got it to the boiling point and it doesn't thicken you can add a cornstarch and milk mixture don't try adding dry cornstarch it will just form clumps and it'll be horrible if it thickens too much so if we get to this the point it starts to turn into jelly you can just put a little bit more milk in there and whisk that in carefully and that will thin it back down again but we've got what i think is about the right texture here now so i'm going to turn the heat right down and i'm going to show you what we're looking for here so i've got a spoon and you can see it's just a it's not completely thick texture but it's thick enough that when you do that it doesn't actually flow back across okay that's going to be completely off the heat now because that will continue to thicken a bit anyway so that's the custard right that's been bubbling away for about an hour now and i did have to top the water up with boiling water from the kettle just once to maintain the level so now we're going to turn that off we're going to carry it over to the other side and carefully remove that now we've got to be really careful here because we're dealing with boiling water and my cunning string handle has fallen down the side so just going to retrieve that string handle and we need to be really careful because if i drop this into the boiling water it's going to splash and that could injure me so it's important to be really really careful with this make sure that's not just going to give the moment i pull up on it okay that's the most dangerous bit done so we're just going to carefully open this up without cutting that foil and paper because i want to test that it is actually cooked properly so i'm just going to snip through the string here and then reveal and we'll just check no it's not quite cooked yeah okay that needs another 20 minutes i think at least so i'm going to put the foil back on carefully re-tie it and back in the pan for another oh let's go for half an hour okay so total cooking time one and a half hours let's try that again and again we've got to be really careful here this string has gone all kind of soggy where it's been steamed just snip off that string again and hopefully this time we got it right let's have a look yep that's going to be done yeah that's good that skewer's coming out nice and clean the aroma of banana coming off of this is wonderful so now i'm just going to take a really thin long bladed knife and carefully run it around the edge i don't think we don't think we actually need to go all the way down because i think this is going to come out no trouble at all and i'm going to take that dish and stand it on a cloth because it's hot invert a plate on top and then very carefully flip the whole thing over and if we're lucky if we've done everything right we've got a steam pudding how about that doesn't that look fantastic and it's look at the slight wobble on that which means it's this delicate soft sponge which is exactly what we want now you can get yourself a spoon rescue these syrupy bits out this thing here spread those on top so they don't go to waste and the other thing people sometimes do is just to go and put another little bit of syrup on the top there but that's really kind of excessive the proof of the pudding is in the eating they say let's serve up a wedge of this treacle banana sponge steamed pudding look at that look how moist and delicate that sponge cake is in there that's fantastic and custard i would normally serve in a jug this is really vanilla sauce in fact there will be some people watching who say hey that's vandala pudding you just made and you're not wrong this is really a vanilla sauce because it lacks the yellow color of custard so let's give it a taste and see what it's like that is so delicious and it just melts in the mouth and one banana has made this whole sponge cake taste intensely of banana and one of the things that's helped with that is that star anise star anise is really good at enhancing the flavor of sweet fruits that is a triumph so part of the reason i've made this recipe is i want babatunde now to try making this in nigeria hopefully all the ingredients i've used are available to him so babatunde and family have a go at making this i want to see your reaction to eating a kind of british classic recipe so i hope that was interesting and i hope that inspires you to make banana steamed pudding thanks for watching and i hope to see you again soon [Music] you
