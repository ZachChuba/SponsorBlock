Danny and Richie from raka raka well sure why he's here and raka raka is probably the number one stunt team on YouTube in my opinion they do awesome action to tell some great stories they have more character in their videos than like 99% of the people that I see out there so wait who plays Ronald McDonald is eight years and nice between it's Michael moves with tell me a little bit about like your team so you have a twin brother and then you have some other guys working with you too like aw does what my VFX guy jacked up coordinator as well Josh yeah so professional baguette in suit these things always seem to go wrong yeah so yeah that's pretty much the team very jealous of your office we don't the lawyers yeah where comes in handy watching your channel you like are constantly getting hit by cars no jumping off your balcony multiple times how do you do that not get killed well yeah it's like let's say the maiden stunt stop tested is more Michael so I like I'll write it and shoot it and direct it and then Michael act in it and do sound effects and music Mike was like he's a stopper for my so he's that verified stop man it was the hardest thing you've had to do yeah so my brother did like a live wrestling matches wrong she doesn't break his nose and he had like a proper stock job like the next day and I so he couldn't go so I had to go pretend to be Mike what I'm doing it was like a Simo such a labor scene sit like a wall running I jump into this ditch it was like it wasn't that high it's not like this hide here and like they had these like really solid wall boots on it was like a really hard ground and I was like what we've got my Raelynn job buzzing oh that drools and I'm like are you gonna do it again okay well not chopped again every time I did it it was early and I was like to the point where I got like yeah let's go again jumped and he says that landed I felt this pain just go right up my legs off and the cameras on me not like this in the background all right literally I tried to walk I couldn't then like we pulled off my mud boots now like both my legs are the small a car it's hard to do you use that the right of it and hope you don't die okay you guys think we're really pro or not oh look yeah but like I said how do you practice for that you [ __ ] your legs or run them over oh yeah yeah I've been actually proven the cocky w few minutes I do gerrae once and it was scary I feel like I'm the one most responsible ones dead if someone actually did come along and was like someone died it would be my father wouldn't ya would be today we and get

want to talk about this on the interview you don't have to but oh no what you're gonna say we're talking about the the backflip off the um yeah the cliff so the the stun actress miscalculated and she and she didn't push out and it was like a human error or whatever it was hitting the rocks on the way down but she was still I care while she's in the footage and like it was terrifying it was like literally one of the scariest moments ever and our live stream I'm stuck gone wrong video is completely based on that experience like that anxiety of everyone going quiet and like not knowing if something's a chaotic out see that guy's fingers cigarette at you so from then on it was like extra portion on top of the caution and when you're already have to stop coordinated said it is already like really that controlled environment like there was divers in the water like the water was broke him of like all these tanks and stuff and it was like she was like a gold medalist like an Olympic diver or something she was like a proper proper diver that was especially stunt was those sort of stunts and they're still it can still go wrong like starts go wrong people die you know who died what was recently Deadpool to you the style actress died so I guess the moral of the story for that Neruda stunt is that wasn't CG that wasn't a dummy we're just watching somebody fall down because try to shut that much out of life if we stop person does that and you don't use the footage it seems like like Alex some people don't like it's disrespectful or like yeah yeah you got to use the footage yeah yeah runs a villain oh man I'm a traitor do not trust me [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] detective ah there's so many dad it's so hard to distinguish what's happening I'm gonna take it who's less
