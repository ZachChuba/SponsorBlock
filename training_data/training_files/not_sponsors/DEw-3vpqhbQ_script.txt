if we look back Intel's high-end desktop or h EDT lineup has for the most part been pretty clearly segmented from their mainstream lineup it's enjoyed processors with higher core counts and larger caches and the motherboards have had more RAM slots taking advantage of the bandwidth and capacity benefits of HDD T's beefier memory controllers and of course on each EDT workstation users have been able to count on being able to install a greater number of high bandwidth PCI Express devices without running into bottlenecks but I would actually make the argument that in the current environment Intel has actually damaged if not mostly destroyed the value proposition of their own entire high-end product stack so what happened exactly I will tell you after this day boots comm /lt tee you can wear them on casual Fridays [Music] Intel had a really good thing going in the absence of any competition they were able to stick with quad-core processors for consumers for 10 years making the argument that well mainstream workloads like aiming that they don't need more course and anyone who does need more course they've probably got real work to do and they can justify ponying up for a chi DT but then AMD happened getting eight true cores with Rison at the beginning of 2017 was a shock for the industry and I don't blame you if you've forgotten that a core isin started at 329 u.s. dollars with performance that compared favorably to Intel's a GD t processors where 8 cores at that time was going to cost you over a grant now Intel responded to that threat and they met AMD's high end thread Ripper line up head-on by dramatically increasing the core counts of its a TD T line up from 10 in the previous generation all the way to 18 with their 7000 series core I nine CPUs but that wasn't enough while mainstream core i7 was still the clear leader in single threaded workloads for anyone who did anything other than just gaming on their machine consumer Rison had a huge price advantage thanks in part to its affordable motherboards so Intel finally had to bump their consumer chips as well first came the six core Core i7 8700 K at the end of 2017 now didn't quite bridge the gap in budget workstation performance with Rison but it did reduce AMD's leads somewhat and thanks to its superior single-threaded performance it kept intel on top for gaming and some other key workloads then fast forward another nine months and we got the core I $9.99 hundred K the first Intel branded eight core consumer CPU and the first CPU ever on Intel's mainstream platform with core on I'm branding along with the core i7 9700 K also eight cores but without SMT or hyper threading technology and then with those CPUs we've got the real reason that Intel has been sandbagging consumer core counts for so long because the h EDT lineup has been traditionally based on intel's workstation and/or server platform where by the nature of these markets tech actually tends to move a little slower it has tended to lag behind their consumer processors architectural II sometimes as much as by two generations so compounding this performance disadvantage is the fact that h EDT processors don't hit such high clock speeds due to power or thermal constraints and that they don't have an onboard graphics processor which over the last five years in particular has come to act as a coprocessor for certain workloads on the consumer chips so we're at a very interesting crossroads right now think about it when we benchmark CPUs for our reviews or whatever we tend to go out looking for workloads that help us demonstrate the potential difference in performance from one ship to another but in the real world how many workstation tasks like even workstation tasks do you actually perform in the course of a workday that require more than eight cores and of those how many of them can't be GPU accelerated in some way that is the ace up the sleeve of consumer chips and we'll be demonstrating that using the platforms you're looking at so with consumer chips you now have up to 16 threads enough to handle h.264 encoding without breaking a sweat and the same goes for light rendering for your 3d modeling and CAD applications along with other traditionally CPU intensive tasks and this is especially true if you have a GPU that can be used to accelerate them so just look at how little our high-end desktop CPUs affect spec view perf here it's basically just run two run variants in most scenarios in fact what's really interesting here is that our main stream processors enjoy a signal it can advantage in applications like SolidWorks which is a traditionally workstation workload thanks to their much higher clock speeds this is again apparent in the case of Adobe Premiere whereas we've tested before more cores does matter but only to a point so here we've reached that happy medium where the thread count the superior per core performance and the integrated graphics of the core I 999 hundred K put it in a league of its own way out ahead of Intel's own a TD T chips even though some of them have more cores I mean this is amazing when you recall again that just two years ago we were stuck with four cores on Intel's consumer platform and had to pay a huge premium to get six or eight let alone the ten core 6950 X that actually cost more by itself than the entire mainstream test bench that we are running here because remember the difference in CPU price is just part of the story the price difference between the platforms themselves can also be significant so all it'll take now is for AMD to continue to press the advantage of their modular cpu design and push core counts even higher with Zen - and then assuming that Intel follows suit and we know by now that they will have to the likely result we think is going to be the contraction and eventual disappearance of the traditional h EDT lineup from intel like think about it for light workstation use honestly Apple hit the nail on the head with the iMac photographers haven't really needed powerful workstations for a very long time now in video production h EDT has offered clear performance improvements even as recently as two to three years ago and has also leveraged the increased pci express bandwidth with expansion cards like red rocket accelerators but GPU compute has eroded the market for devices like that very significantly I mean how many expansion cards do you have in your system so we're not saying that chips like thread Ripper and then tell zone hike or count CPUs won't continue to have a place in desktop workstations there are workloads for them we're just saying that the use cases for those chips are not very mainstream anymore and that h EDT is the wrong product for those kinds of customers and the reason is ECC memory support Rison supports ECC from the ground floor all the way up to thread Ripper - which makes it perfect for an entry-level workstation that has a need for ECC by contrast intel has desperately clung to the paradigm of removing ECC from its consumer and h EDT processors to force anyone doing more mission-critical work to spend still more on a Xeon that obviously isn't going to last so the bottom line is this we were wrong when we did our review of the Xeon w we said Xeon w had no reason to exist with only ECC to differentiate it from h EDT because the performance was the same but actually h EDT has no reason to exist if it doesn't support ECC because it's getting eaten away at from both the bottom and the top by Intel's own 9000 series consumer chips and AMD's thread Ripper so here's our new proposed line up you continue to expand the consumer chips with more course when possible but don't compromise single-threaded performance that's still your key advantage in certain workloads like gaming and SolidWorks then once that's done you replace the high core count line up wholesale with Xeon w so that's the lower end single socket only workstations the online and while you're at that you get your head out of your butt when it comes to the pricing of those chips they should end up in line with the core AI nines that they will replace that way you cut out one entire platform to support which makes life easier on marketing teams and board partners and consumers now I suspect Intel won't take my advice as to like making money after all but there may come a time when it's absolutely necessary just like very eventually gonna have to bring coffee like refresh to their LGA 1151 Zeon's threatening even Zeon W but that's a conversation for another day for now the bottom line is this let's give credit where credit is due AMD brought more course to the table and Intel responded in kind so there has never been a better time to build a value oriented desktop machine that can do serious workstation work and if this is what the death of a GD T as we know looks like then I am super ok with that ting is the mobile carrier that's sweet right - 2018 dot ting calm down there so thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it was awesome get subscribed hit
