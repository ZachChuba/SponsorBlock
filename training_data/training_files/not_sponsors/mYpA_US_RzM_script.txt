[Music] hey guys this is soph i'm just about to go for a drive so i've set up the map to take me to a location where we're going through some windy roads so i just wanted to test it on the windy roads hopefully it should be pretty fun i know that there's there's been a huge improvement on the fsd beta compared to the previous release software so we're going to give it a try and see how it does all right here we go should be able to enable it right away just like we did before perfect let's do it all right so far it's doing really well going straight okay we're coming up to another stop sign to turn left and there's a car coming the other way and a pedestrian a little farther we up we're stopping and turning made a very good stop that time and it didn't cut the corner so that was perfect so i haven't actually gone down this road yet on fsd beta so this is the first time so far is handling it really well [Music] awesome it's maintaining a very similar distance on the right hand side it's saying uh staying in a good position so that's great got a little close to the curb there but still fine there we go sorry i was noticing a rattle it was just my visor was not uh locked in okay so here we come up to this t intersection this is quite a fast high-speed road on the we're coming up to so i want to make sure i'm extremely safe with this okay it's looking good very good awesome so now we're coming up to the stop sign where we're going to turn right see how it does there's a truck coming so and another vehicle so let's wait make sure that it stops here perfect okay we're ready to go i'm not gonna do anything sweet a little wide there but still okay all right coming up to this three-way intersection well four-way if you count that driveway there pretty good all right now we're going on the canyon drive it's such a beautiful area around here this is one of my favorite drives you can go the 101 freeway but um you don't get to see beautiful horses and uh trees everywhere i mean there is the ocean of course but yeah it's a beautiful drive here so so far no disengagements the car is working perfectly beautifully slowing down for the turn here the left hand turn and it's doing great you can almost feel the software working where it's really trying to figure out what's what to anticipate when we're coming up to intersections or tight turns and things like that so for example this turn let's see how it does when it comes up to it and it should slow down going around this tight turn so which it has perfect very nice so i haven't touched the panels at all i have been putting a little bit of input into the steering wheel so it doesn't nag me to to provide input just anticipating it great slowing down quite far for this i think it puts the turn signal on it doesn't have to but just to ensure maybe for my uh my account to to let it let me know that it's going the correct way so far so good zero zero disengagements okay car coming the other way slowing down for the turn very nice this is a decreasing radius turn so let's see how it handles this yeah very nice so far i'm really enjoying this drive it's been really fun so now i'm going to change where i want to go because i have put in the directions to get to a partial location to force it to come down this road but now i'm going to change the directions a little bit to keep it going to the next spot take me to okimomo it's one of my favorite places around here and there we go so now we should just keep going and go on to our destination we want to test some of the turning across the main road when we get there so that'll be the next thing we try out so far it's doing great on these windy roads this is the future very good it's gonna break quite hard for this i'm anticipating it actually that was pretty good listen wasn't too hard awesome very nice so i haven't touched any of the pedals or given it any uh deviations with steering input or anything just barely touching the wheel so it doesn't nag me and it's been doing an amazing job pretty cool i mean some of the lane positioning his positioning could be improved a little bit but otherwise it's uh it's really it's good it's just fascinating how far along the software has come so good this is the boring part of the road so it's a little straight here for a while but very scenic i do love this area still got some twisty parts twisty parts of the roads coming up soon yeah if you notice on the screen if you guys aren't familiar with autopilot but most of you guys watching this video probably are but the blue steering wheel here means that autopilot's engaged which means the full self driver full self-driving beta software is running and engaged it's doing great so it just started to sprinkle with rain and i do have the auto wipers on so hopefully they turn on if they don't i can just manually trigger them with the stock here on the left hand turn signal stock the beautiful cows over there chilling all right i'm gonna just clear this little spray on the on the windshield so it did tell me that the windshield wipers were on yeah i just manually manually turned the windshield wipers on for just a second just because it was uh yeah okay veered to the right just a little bit there but still came back nicely so that's good still no disengagement which is awesome okay we've got some cyclists over there there's plenty of space for them it's nice there's a lot of cyclists out tonight this evening so it did slow down for the cyclists a little bit there don't realize they got plenty of space so keep going so i can see that pickup in front of us you can see his visualization is way in the distance there certainly see it oh look windshield wipers went on on their own great so it is working looks like there's some growing some broccoli over there it's cool you can enjoy enjoy the broccoli or something some green maybe collard greens or something so so so far it's been going on autopilot full self-driving beta for over 10 minutes now with no interventions or disengagements or anything pretty amazing no waving come on yeah some people they just don't don't wave they don't wave on other tesla owners that's fine even if i wave with two hands next time i'll stick my hands out the window green so i see a flashing yellow is light up ahead let's see if the car slows down a bit i know it did earlier on when i took it out earlier it slowed down for the yellow light let's see if it sees it be very curious well it's a yellow light for a traffic light so slow down a tiny little bit but the car in front of me slowed down too so okay we're going straight car go go go go go okay i didn't touch it didn't do anything great awesome [Music] oops i thought i was pushing the wheel i wasn't holding it but it's uh just got to put a little bit of pressure or you know just push the plus time with the scroll button here you can push it up a little higher okay he's picking the right lane that's good i've actually decided to stay on the left lane okay that's fine we'll stay in this line okay i touched the steering wheel for the first stop i just want to accelerate it up a little bit so okay we're gonna go in the right line there we go cyclist plenty of space there perfect okay getting a little bit more traffic here so that's always a good good test for it let's drop it back to the speed limit just one mile over so that lane kind of shifted a little bit and handled it like a champ so carts running across didn't need to slow down it's far enough away and now it's deciding to slow down a little bit for some reason we go so like i was saying before it's your disengagement so far i could step on the accelerator one time just because i wanted to accelerate it a little bit at the traffic lights but otherwise no disengagements no interventions just a little bit speeding it up a little bit that's it speed limit should drop down to 40 which it did which is great the car will slow down for this guy in front likely oh it didn't have to car accelerated up enough okay we'll see where it's gonna turn just passing this road here not this one this next one here that i'm going to do some tests coming out this i'm going to cross over this lane later on see how we do so let's see how it does coming through here i did disengage because uh it just i couldn't handle it so but i think that did pretty great we went quite far all the way through so congratulations fsd tesla the entire team you've been amazing [Music] you
