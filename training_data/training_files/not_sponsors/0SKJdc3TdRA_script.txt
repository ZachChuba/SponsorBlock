good a lot to take in here I love it and I start ruining it's almost as if they took our note of they should put something in this room it's most of most of the stuff that they added was because of our playthrough yeah I like to believe that I'm not important yeah even though there's plenty of evidence to the contrary okay so what was the deal what's going on good to see you again so what's your story I'm here with since a Frank I'm not with since I Frank but I'm like his second-in-command we run things you know we're keeping this party safe and alcohol-free for some reason sounds like she can be turned oh yeah she's gonna get some alcohol dude yeah hey now take it easy all right we don't drink at this party or at least that's what's insane Frank told me to say y'all recovering alcoholics or something why can't we drink no why can't we drink huh hmm I bet you like to work out I'm not just about keeping this fit I'm about turning my body into a weapon I got big plans with this body of mine I'm going to open a self-defense studio and everything so people see the way I look they'll come running and then they'll send people running because nothing says self-defense like a weapon I love Leah yeah she's cool how do you know everyone I don't I'm here for work security you know but I think I've seen that blonde chick with them big titties at the gym there's something about her I've definitely seen her before she looks so sad so it's even sadder in this version that she did in the last one I don't know who you're talking about yeah I think Frank could use your help Guardian oh look here whoa what was that I missed it I was your face went like like wild for a second really she went like she was like ha ha ha hmm for like one second ok open what else we got there's a there's a foam finger around here somewhere I don't know where the foam finger is though oh hello ha the Viper Tron 3000 yeah it's very nice so futuristic let's give that to us call me the switch playing Frank the fist [Music] this is really us at parties yeah well just like hanging with girls I was studying the blade you don't have a penis cat cool your [ __ ] jets or mr. business is

okay like we got it we got a follow leave a flower that special flower oh is that a thing good certainly looks like a thing Oh give us a flower too oh you shouldn't have you're too lovely through and through but if you don't find a way to get her and me out of this godforsaken house I'm gonna stick this flower you know what it really is a nice flower I I stand corrected my character is on edge [Laughter] I have allergic to flowers and trees and shellfish and the dander of certain house cats and holding my fingers over my nose Wow skittish after that pretty similar it's because I put my my fingers over - oh yes when I did that one that was the joke oh I would not have done that yes Jake maybe that's why they programmed you putting your fingers over your nose earlier oh yeah how's it going dude staying away from the alcohol I think I get that camera back I promise I'll bring it back later tonight sure you've shown your loyalty to me and loyalty should be rewarded well yeah go nuts dude but I want that back and jam-packed with this many pics of people's floppy [ __ ] bits as possible before I head out sloppy fun but if you fail me although find of you is your sloppy [ __ ] bit toad sounds reasonable good guy that Frank yeah throw a real nice fellow we haven't spoken to Rachel Arash Lee here 8 so what's up hey I'm Rachel sorry if you just saw me SWAT that guy that was like 30 minutes ago I'm not a giant [ __ ] I just I can't even get into it some people need to be slapped it happens cool have you not heard anything about Patrick before tonight no do you know the website neighborhood watch what is that like a like a sex offender site yes I'll just happen to get word on that just stay away from that chemical burn of a person over there if you'll excuse me I'm gonna figure out how I can get my alcohol back from a different guy who funny story decided to confiscate all the alcohol from a party Rachel's a lot more done with everyone's [ __ ] in this version yeah I can give you alcohol or will Frank see it yeah you might see it Frank's a [ __ ] party pooper hey guys that's really awkward for the both of us to be honest I like that so so far we we crashed into a party on an air balloon and we're not talking to anybody yeah it sounds about right well it's like we're trying to help help him you want to save it and try to give the alcohol to Rachel Oh should probably check in on them yeah they're fine Rachel were you at Rachel were you at you managed to lose her dude I mean they're they're like [ __ ] gizelle oh she's over here now so I can just give it to her have some Nattie Rachel doesn't want that right now she just said she wants booze hey how's it going talk to her what's up I was having an okay time until [ __ ] Frank stole my thermal ocean confiscating it let me talk that would be amazing I would be very appreciative yeah I know sweat uh-huh not interested well we already we already lived that time line yeah yeah all right Leah what's going on with you art Leia what's up you having a good time you can thank sensei Frank and I for that are you sure yeah right so what if you give her alcohol oh oh that's something we're gonna save yeah let's just go ahead and save that safe game but now she's in front of Frank Leah booze let's just try it since I saved it huh save they're just like both in saying like hey [ __ ] give hey give me that don't you know since then Frank has me on the ass what been Duty on anybody caught with booze I like you so we're just gonna act like this rolled out the pant leg of that flower shirt dude good to know thanks yeah what's going on what do I do with Leah what do I do to get her to talk anymore yeah are you developing a crash well she's pretty interesting she's got cool things going on with her she's a martial artist that's pretty dope all right examine the lock on Ashley's closet door okay got it [Music] what is that the club yeah maybe I can punch the lock off punch the lock off yeah so I guess I can get her to punch the lock off the door dance for blind kids hey what's going on good to see you again play around there no no oh yeah I saw her face going at the code so I could start you know shoot this thing there with her was like my eyes okay okay was the key to unlock become French with Katherine then untie Ashley's top okay which one's Ashley wait it's not Ashe is the one with the black top we were just in a room with a lot right here yes that's her hello hi I'm Ashley I'm Madison's sister nice to meet you so you're the own ice art room are you joking calling that a nice art room is like calling a homeless camp a music festival okay right there but just like with that made of astrology she buys into or that time she [ __ ] the Lou Diamond Phillips impersonator Madison is doing this for attention Ernests are cool and free spirits naturally Madison's gonna try to be an artist then she can post all about it online and soak in the thumbs up and well done it's not art she is not an artist that's what happens when I no longer have a place to Center my Zen serenity Ashley's serenity oh no I used to be her really like to express that Madison is [ __ ] art and that that room was much better suited in my studio slash meditation chamber weed undisturbed than it will ever be as a hax gallery of delusion do whatever you will I'm going to find something large and made of glass that I can smash because that's inner peace [ __ ] named Asti named Asti yeah hey again how's it going are you the co-host well I doubt Madison would ever call me that but I do live here too so call it what you want okay cost it is you're sweet I'm here if you have any questions about the crowd including yours truly as co-host of this evening I'd be super bummed if you felt left out or whatever that's nice too that lock in your closet oh that's nothing I lock up my closet because that's where I keep my waxing machine what oh yeah you have no idea I had to get the industrial sized one they used in salons it looks like one of those evil robots from Doctor Who what can I say I've got the genes of a werewolf but I've still got to look good for beach season do you really think that she watches Doctor Who I don't even watch Doctor that's all no need to keep talking about Michael a big Moffat fan check that bike lock make sure it's as strong as the infomercial said it would be oh okay where do you keep all the key for that bike right right because one major part of having something locked up it's telling someone where they could find the key to unlock said thing it's in her bra is it really yeah okay that seems awfully like overkill for protectiveness of a key okay come on just tell me hey it's always close at hand making a key shaped dimple into my left tit okay okay well this has been enlightening got to be a way to get it without her piss at pissing her off or I could try an easier route well what in the world could you do to get it that would not piss her off how's it going I saw Frank checking out your ass oh wait that was me damn I wish I was cross site so you could see twice those lines never work yeah tell me about the guest of the evening Ashley you've got all sorts here I can't lie most of these folks are Madison's friends but they've taken me into their group to which I'm sure Madison it just hates but yeah like everyone's pretty cool except for Frank I'll keep that in mind hey again else you have that's it okay so I need to I need to get I need to open this okay in order to advance the the least okay oh it's so bizarre to hear us talk I know to see you again yeah where are we right now hey brah oh you here can we unlock Jess as well or is is it one or the other that you are ma all I have no idea you know the bathroom is got a [ __ ] Wow Aaron congratulation [ __ ] very uncharacteristic Chet we got to get out of here find us away or we're [ __ ] all righty then who the hell is this oh that's Madison okay Oh God well it looks like everyone's having a great time wandering around solitarily at this part I know really not not a whole lot I like chatting going on speak to Leah and Informer over the security threat she will go and speak to Frank who's outside by the front okay okay okay I have to do this this is like what happens I do I think you're looking down so you didn't see it that's what happens with me when I walk into a room and I see a shadow I don't like right now you just see me like walking in and then like freeze Dericks check out she said being the horny being the horny yes sorry it's just really awkward for the both of us to be honest okay bye they took a lot of like the random stuff we said in the game I have to make a call to my brother and his phone time is very restricted I don't think you what all right just say [ __ ] you to death huge night I go into Madison's room ever what's up with you [Music] okay okay okay I really have to do this I have to do the Lea mission okay and I have to do the top thing all right I have to untie Ashley's top oh should I just do it watching a mature animal catches on the Internet there's always getting bit I'll tell you [ __ ] [ __

it Ashley Ashley Ashley we didn't actually go where is she bathroom no the bedroom oh my god where did she go did this house get like five times bigger I know right I remember ever losing anyone in the satchel they walk so fast I don't know what's going on with you and girly but after her tits popped out I found this key yes well done you must have swallowed it and it came and lodged when your jaw hit the floor I've got far more important things going on but you've been cool tonight and I thought you'd want it back yes I was looking for that thank you yeah your dreams of hanging out with the grumps have really come true Catherine there you are standing in the same room not making any eye contact tiny key just should you close the door so she doesn't see what's going oh my god there's a giant snake oh hello that's not a waxing machine uh this thing's huge I'm gonna unlatch and just let the snake out holy crap oh do I have to like I have to like oh that's what that hissing is it's the [ __ ] snake his name is Julius squeezer all right this is the snake gonna get out he's gonna he's gonna leave okay after a few minutes Ashley will come and tell you that her snake has escaped uh-huh yes and this is how I guess it eventually leads to that not exactly what I want to do okay Leah's a much more interesting person than that Oh forgive me it came about literally everything why would I have assumed such a thing what house party is all about the complex interpersonal relationships that we all share dang I just my boyfriend is in the doghouse for sure cool oh my god my boyfriend C you know what kind of trouble the grumps are getting no no that's fine don't worry about the grumps no Caroline they're jackasses trust me we're gonna occupy ourselves in any situation oh my god where is Madison I have to wait a couple minutes for Madison to notice that her snake is loose snake is even loose yet Madison where are you get get out of here whatever Ashley we may have a little itsy-bitsy problem well not really the problem is about ten feet long and please don't make a dick joke you know what else is ten feet I mean what's the problem don't freak but my pet snake he's gotten loose somehow how could that have possibly happened and how could you know about it since I was just up there and he was there and you've been down here the whole time I really need your help with this if Madison finds out I've been keeping my snake in this house all this time I'll be kicked out on my ass faster than that time I tried to rush the stage of my favorite kpop band oh boy she's really not mad at you anymore no please talk to Leah for me and see if you two can't wrangle Julius back into his terrarium I'd say ask Frank but I have a feeling he can't be trusted only talk to Leah and Madison cannot know she calls her Leah Oh weird yeah okay okay so now I have to talk to Leah wonder what's up you havin a good time you could think since they Frank and I for that no problem a olya there's a security threat and I need your help security threat huh let me guess the chick with the glasses call someone a donkey brain again stabbing no that's a security threat look at Frank just dealing with the demons in his head really trying to suppress that rage dude it's not working though a lot of problems inside there there's a [ __ ] snake on the loose in this house Oh baby up and waited to wait where is he going per my contract I gotta run all security concerns up the letter command need act now I know we gotta know I took a leg and I'm a woman of my word we have to talk to him he'll drop the plan of attack okay I'm already up there killing the snake bro okay yes okay let's hop to it wait a sec isn't there a way you can romance Frank yeah like you as Aaron yeah Oh baby are we gonna do that what is Frank doing out here are we gonna do of course we are doing some awesome gonna see all the content all right Leah what's going what's going on Frank dad you are not guarding the liquor everything okay he's staying away from the alcohol tape I've spat in the direction of anyone who's even looked at the liquor and I [ __ ] them a bit just to be sure the warning really marinates besides I had to take a call hostage situation potential for mass [ __ ] casualties managed to diffuse the whole situation over the goddamn phone like a champion who is this man sorry about Hey dode mind your business what's going on here anyway what's the situation yeah I'll let Leo Frank we have a creature on the loose within the premises there is a snake in the house well see get real scaly in there if we don't find that bastard snake Hey all right Leah we're here for security not Animal Control snakes have got rabies or scabies or some other [ __ ] this is below our pay grade your orders are not to act work on your thunder punches instead razor skis you heard me apprentice until you're out on your own running that self-defense studio like you've always dreamed of you answered a maze Rachel girl Frankie the Pfister to be aware of the evil creature that's invaded our all and that the best course of action would be to burn the whole house down and ask for forgiveness from whichever demon she pissed off oh babe DVD call shaolin's suck and [ __ ] so uh I guess it's true hmm well you know there's a security threat and we need your help security threat huh let me guess the chick with the glasses called someone a donkey brandy gate so what [ __ ] in the microwave we're still definitely going after that snake since a Frank has done a lot for me he's even helping me scope out a spot where I can open my own studio it wouldn't be right to go against his orders it's against the code the code of kick-ass well time to break the [ __ ] code yeah sometimes you have to break one code to do right by your own code isn't it the duty of an apprentice to rise up and defeat her master Frank is weak yeah I think you're thinking of the SIF from Star Wars but I'm seeing what you're saying I'm gonna be striking out on my own suit with the self-defense studio it might be high time I start making my own decisions yeah this feels good she's turning right like like anger leads to hate what if we're doing this we're gonna need a light there's too many dark ass corners in this place and I'm not just gonna go willy-nilly into the shadows like that and I'm not gonna be killed off before the opening credits are over see let me give a flash Ashley and Madison have themselves a tool box filled with all the stuff you need to keep the house from falling apart flashlights included but better off getting somebody's phone so we can use that if there's a national phone shortage yeah no nobody has a phone here that's the that's the that's the plot that's our point okay I can't believe this is happening you know when we started playing this game like and now all of a sudden we're like so in it so in the lore jeez Wow easy man Wow all right they actually just sorted one wild and crazy night you see being the horny all right okay so Leah where the hell is that [ __ ] finger boy heron if I had a nickel I just can't feel it and I'm not looking backwards you told me not to what is that it's like a ping-pong ball oh yeah oh yeah of course for the beer pong remember when we did the 10 meter per hour with beer pong but we couldn't say beer pong yes look soda throw time is very restrictive God where the hell is that finger it's gotta be around here somewhere it doesn't just say and the walkthrough well it's just sort of like a random thing I don't know it just pops out the safe or didn't we break into this yeah the numbers were written down somewhere where are they written down I don't know like remembering everything is going through remembering all the little things well maybe we'll remember more next time on game ground that's right I got a P anyway a thing it's a USB stick oh well done sir you leave dad we haven't spoken you at Aaron geez but she's not part of this mission hey y'all oh that's right she's got like a country accent yeah oh she's sweet alright see ya Yeah right everyone I can't character me said exactly what Mimi said at the beginning
