something that's always fun to me when looking at old Angelfire websites is seeing one that was clearly only ever intended to be seen by the creators small circle friends and I think that's the case with one of these Saved by the Bell websites that I came across recently and on top of that I also found out that Steve Urkel was supposed to be in Saved by the Bell and don't forget that if you want to be involved the next time I record an angel fire adventures follow me at twitch TV slash Justin Wang of investigation anyway angel fire adventures episode 2 let's do it [Music] start off with the basics Saved by the Bell Angelfire see here's the thing that I've realized I kind of like looking at a lot of these websites what happens is they kind of they serve as a little bit of like a Wikipedia before Wikipedia existed many new viewers of Saved by the Bell are confused by the changing characters in various settings for Saved by the Bell first major continuity lapse is easily understandable once knows once one knows the history of the show itself Saved by the Bell did not begin its run at Saved by the Bell nor did most of its first season air on NBC Saved by the Bell first began as a pilot for NBC and the name of the show was good morning miss bliss gmmb for short the gmmb pilot did air on NBC back in 1987 it aired in the facts of life's time slot the pilot for gmmb did not have any of the cast - Saved by the Bell or even any of the leader cast of good morning miss bliss instead the pilot starred Hayley Mills Brian Austin Green of Beverly Hills now - and oh Fame and Jaleel White a Family Matters wait what I don't remember Jaleel White being on this is that accurate holy [ __ ] and there's the there sonic the hedghog like alright so that's we have uncovered a little something here I had no idea that her goal was originally supposed to be in Saved by the Bell who would have who would Arkell have been if Jaleel White was tied up with his Saved by the Bell obligations that's a timeline that exists out in the world somewhere we're gonna get Joe Rogan on the case I feel like Maria's Saved by the Bell site is it's a little too nice of a website but for our purposes I feel like what we really need right now is to look at some shitty [ __ ] websites Zack Morris fan page angel fire oh he'll hella yeah this is good be a shitty website alright here we go now you see what's interesting about these kinds of websites to me from this period of time you don't really have Wikipedia or any these episode guides like you do now so when people make a website like this they're just doing it old all off the top of their head well it didn't even occur to me that this is all all-caps I don't know if I have it in me to like blow through all of this like it's basically just like pure like statements of facts about things that happen to them let's see what else they have here all right back to back to eating my [ __ ] ah it's gone you see what what is another advantage of usually browsing these old Angelfire pages is that a lot of times you'll come across an old page even something on the Internet Archive and you'll click on links and there's little dead links even like just like you'll have a whole section of a site that's not archived but anything that was over here I'm assuming that this is something that was just like it was always a bad link because that's usually how it goes today we let Slater up to the plate I think that I share completely different different opinion than most people in Slater I know that Brady and I disagree who's Brady I guess Brady is his friend oh my you know it's very likely actually with these kinds of pages that it was only ever intended to be seen by a small amount of people so like Brady is his friend that he made the site IR like another person on here but they disagree on Brady as you'll see when you read my take on him oh we got to get this uh capture dippel's to like totally die for the post later was a complex character he was busy juggling his massive athletic potential with this blatant homosexuality that's [ __ ] right I said it Slater was gay he was the first gay character on Saturday morning TV trust me it all pans out in the end all right um I'm so glad that I decided to stick with this website what was Slater's favorite sport that's right wrestling just putting it out there Slater had a pet lizard party well that little [ __ ] died and Slater got old deep onit's I mean come on Slater wanted to be a cook till everyone started calling him uh word up we'll get me four banned from twitch if I say it out loud probably he also took ballet which he wasn't afraid to dance around in his tights all let me tell you something balle for dudes isn't tight having a hard time accepting the obvious truth huh have all this little Jam he was under tremendous pressure from his father to succeed Slater hated his dad so much what is the most Prarie thing to do to piss off your parents that's right be gay it Slater's dad was in the military so you know he had a very view very strict view on it see oh god I do however distinctly remember several episodes in which Slater wore nothing but his wrestling getup or a towel he was always in the locker room too by the way probably check you at all got in there all right now reading this now I'm thinking that 100% the guy who made this website just like me the Slater is Gareth to piss off his friend Brady let's see what he's got to say about Jessie Jessie holds a special place in all of our hearts for one simple reason showgirls Jessie was the one person on the show who actually had a serious opinion on something whether it be from drilling oil to saving the trees to drinking too much Jagermeister and sleeping with the valley football team she voiced hers this led to one problem that she talked a lot more than she should years later she got it right shut up and let us see what we wanted to see all those years just God let's do some more so anyways back to the point Jessie basically was a psycho waiting to explode let's just think back to when she was singing in hot Sunday I got totally hooked on caffeine pills we all remember when Zack found her sleeping and she tried to take a pill and started singing and crying at the same time the e true Hollywood story made sure they showed that part because it was hands-down one of the greatest moments on the show so Jessie was totally smacked out on the show choose to have the [ __ ] most strangest dreams which led me to believe that caffeine pills weren't the only thing she was taken she was obviously on shrooms our acid Jessie was involved with Slater whether it was to help his alibi or she liked using a strap on him trap on on him as well we'll never really know she did have a little thing with Brent the [ __ ] that Lisa hooked him up with Brady's take on Jessie Spano Jessie was hot but she was a big-time head case she came with too much baggage she had nice legs decent fashion sense and nice hair she did have a little horse face Jessie was pretty smart too so that's another plus the biggest draw to Jessie for me is the fact that she used the bump caffeine pills everyone made such a big deal out of that I thought it was tight I mean that's what I like do with my spare time let's look at the screech now first of all screech didn't really bother me like most people in fact half the time I never you noticed he was there some people might say that every time screech talked it was like someone running their finger nails down a chalkboard plays it-- in my book his love life was damn near non-existent he was constantly trying to get into Lisa's panties but she didn't want to know at first I thought it was the whole black/white thing but that was soon cleared up once she rammed her tongue down Zacks throat and most likely gave him a smoke down by the willow trees I I've never heard the phrase a smoke down I'm assuming it's a [ __ ] or something is that the whole flying a smoke down by the willow tree set the whole phrase or is like the screech tried hard though and only gave up when he met violet Bickerstaff I remember violet violet was perfect reach played by Tori Spelling before she got soccer balls put in her chest now it's time for a breeze take Creech was is okay I didn't love him and I didn't hate him he tried too hard when he came to Lisa I mean he had a nice piece of tail and violet all over him yet he still pined over Lisa great chess player and one hell of a mascot I lost a lot of respect for him when he subjected himself to save by the bell the new class however I gained a lot more respect for him after he beat the dog-piss out of horshack in celebrity boxing - what wait so what was that like an actual boxing The Legend of screech versus for Shaq hi so this is Dustin Diamond did a boxing match damn oh oh oh oh [ __ ] Dustin diamonds wrecking this dude yo Dustin Diamond is [ __ ] dominating this guy what the hell's going on oh yeah pine cool of course I know he made a porno that was uh I definitely made a reference to that in my white team in the video with Dustin Diamond calm looks like it's time to dissect Kelly now what the [ __ ] is up with that hair Kelly had obvious issues at home which led to her being very manipulative at having the conversation skills of Helen Keller in the end though she always came back to Zack no matter how many times she strayed away from for a touch of something new she always realized that Zack wasn't deep God she'd come back to me too she'd come back to him kiss him on the cheek which in the Saved by the Bell universe is equal to about 10 hours of steamy steamy hardcore [ __ ] Brady's take on Kelly Kapowski Kelly was a pretty hot chick she was a [ __ ] tease though she had the reverse Winnie Cooper thing going on though what I mean by that is Winnie was looking good way back in the day in the early Wonder Years seasons as she got older the more she started to slip she is off she is awful now and I wouldn't bang her if I were Jessie Monroe however Kelly has gotten hotter as the years have gone on she is looking better than ever on that show fast lane so bottom line is I would have done Kelly any day in high school I think these guys back when this website was made they're still similar hopped up on that showgirls buzz blast one of the main cast Lisa she could play a mean [ __ ] bass though and was part of the tightest rhythm section in any band along with Slater her voice also goes unmentioned but those of us who remember the Zack attack know damn right that she could hit the high notes same episode she was lethal Lisa in the future so weak Lisa got ridiculously hot after the show and even Martin Lawrence tried to get himself Bell she was overshadowed by Kelly and Jessie and mostly episodes Saved by the Bell hotness rating from one to ten seven she was little boring to me but still hot for a black chick I knew I knew somewhere they were gonna go there I was waiting for one and it had to come very end [Applause]
