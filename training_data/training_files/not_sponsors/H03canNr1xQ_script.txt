this week raga myself are going to buy our own PK setups off the GE we have two hours to make as much money as possible so that we can buy the best setup we've come up with at the start of the video you'll see we've both already bought our load outs we have to try and make enough money to buy those load outs if we don't have enough money we have to drop items from those load outs and end up at the final fight missing parts of our PK setup Treasure Trail items and untradable two aren't allowed so for example a third age long sword or a fire cape both aren't available for us we have to buy everything off the GE but first a word shadow legends the link is in the description you think my leaves are are you kidding me bees and genes of super satisfied right babies welcome back to another PvP challenge as you can see we're showing off our gear at the start here so this is the gear that we want to get so I need to make enough money to get this gear together as you can see going for a range tank set up here into a dark post spec along with a super restore a sorrow brew a ranging pot and an anti fire mix the anti fire mix I went for a mix because it heals rather than just a normal fire that doesn't heal and just in case he goes for the the dragon fire bolts rather than the diamond bolts because I think he is gonna go range now as you saw in the intro the whole point of this is to make enough money to afford the whole inventory and all the items as well so if we go over here and click these three off as you see I've got to make one point eight mill just over one point eight mill a love this if I fall short then I have to get rid of an item and I can't bring it to the final fight and save for kids as well so it depends on how well we can make our money we've got four different activities 30 minutes each to go ahead and do it so let's get into the first money maker and of course it's gonna be Zara right this is definitely an odd one guys because we have our final gear or at least what we want our final gear to be before we even filmed the episode it's so so backwards but as you can see I'm going tank range with room crossbow some barrows equipment we have a Nabi cape blessed be rat shields going full-on tank with the bruise we have emerald bullets enchanted diamond bullets enchanted anti fire antidote ranging potions of course super restores and just an overall tanky setup that is not supposed to really go for super strong DPS but just to last the entire fight and hopefully outlast whatever method he is doing now we have four tasks that we get to do 30 minutes each and let's see how much we have to make per task so we have eight or two eight three seven two eight three seven divided by 4 that is 709 K that we need to go for essentially to get this entire set up now the IB cabe is thankfully a lot of money so that would be the first thing I would drop if I don't get all the required funds for the rest of the gear it's like over 600 K so that is more than 150 K added off per task and 559 K I think I can easily do especially when I do voor cath and solo which will be my first two that I do and yeah this is the setup we need two point eight mill in two hours for tasks 30 minutes each let's go do it guys and I hope this setup is enough to get the win and of course we can't really risk something super expensive in a very crucial spot like a dragon crossbow because we can't afford that we're literally going and punching and something like a dragon crossbow is 2.8 millet or around that but if I get a big money drop it would have really sucked but it's that whole risk versus reward type of situation but let's start off with some Zora and I will see you guys there okay let's start the timer and I'm gonna do my 30 minutes of Zorah now I was thinking about going for the the switch and doing mage and range but I just haven't done it in so long I don't know if I'd be more efficient doing that or whether I'm just gonna be better off with a Tebow so I'm just gonna go with a Tebow here even though it probably is better DPS going for a mage and range but you know we'll see we'll see first kill and it is gonna be not great not great let's be honest could have been a lot better than that but let's get into the next one kill number 3 and yes that's what we want to say that's out really really good better loot that 130-140 HK lovely for kill trip and that we won't take that's actually a really really bad lot of loot there and the 3k coins horrible but 4 kills 10 minutes gone not too happy so far to be honest but we will see I'm not getting good luck I am really not getting treated here at all very very drowning unique by the way like hundreds of kills so what if we could grab a unique that would be awesome and then I could just turn up with everything I wanted that would be very nice what the [ __ ] is that snakeskin and flax are you taking the piss mate please big Lou big Lutz what the [ __ ] I can't believe how poor this Lutz been it has been atrocious alright starting off with Zora let's start that timer and let's literally waste no time fling right in here and yes take me to the Zola shrine and let's hope we get some good drops again we need around 700 K every 30 minutes to get the setup that we need of course to go in Tebow only super chill incredibly fast and I say that and I'm starting off with some zeroes that kill was so fast that kill was so fast oh wow yes guys yes wow we're gonna zoom through this I'm so excited so we for kill trip coming up and we only were here for 9 minutes interesting interesting drop I remember when link was stressing over this [ __ ] thing but we're gonna Bank well it looks like we have 417 K worth aleut so zoom in through this [ __ ] guys zooming through this [ __ ] I don't think we'll have a problem at all now that I think about it [ __ ] get the kill get the kill oh my gosh that was way too [ __ ] close for kill trip though wow that is the worst drop we got but this inventory was pretty good we got a magic seed which is quite pricey $1000 scales time to Bank and we have 10 minutes left so it looks like we can still get like one more for kill tripping and we are at 941 k already super stoked about it unfortunately three kills this trip and I didn't have enough time to actually Bank because it was my last kill of course I don't have enough food for 34 HP it's not looking like I'm gonna get it probably just gonna tell you if it hits me once probably not even worth risking it right those meetings are gonna hit me ya know okay not bad though guys not bad we made exactly 1.2 mil from eleven Zoeller kills of course that is way past the 700 K average that need but Zola is one of the best money makers out there and forecast next is also one of the best money makers out there but of course the other two aren't going to be as efficient as that the tebow has been noodling for me the drops have been shy at least we got some Zola scales there thank [ __ ] for that yeah really not been going great here and I actually need to tell you how because I don't really have enough prey for another kill ten minutes left I don't know how much I've made will check the loot tracker in a bit and then and then we'll see but I don't think it's gonna be that great please some orangey yes that's better that is more like it lovely it's exactly what we needed yes okay yeah it's bringing that average up I'm happy with a hundred K as long as it kills over 100 K more than happy and every time we get one that's higher we're just bringing that average right up I think we're looking quite good actually last few kills have been awesome five minutes left should be able to get two more kills in here so yeah things are looking actually fairly decent I'm quite happy so far bang and not a great kill but nearly 100 K last kill probably 3:18 I mean if we do get a quick kill here it is possible to get two but honestly t-bo's really not been doing too well for me at all so I'm not counting on it one more kill probably but the lutes looks pretty decent last few kills so I think we're good yeah we're not gonna get another kill in here so that is gonna be last kill and we will take it as well over 100 KS so let's have a look at the price checker let's just stop a clock oh wow a lot better than I thought a lot better than I thought so 12 kills we got and made 1.2 3 mil meaning I only need to make like 600 K in the rest of the episode to be able to buy the whole gear setup I won't for [ __ ] so here we go guys we're at vork at now worketh has never been my boss a choice but you know it'd be silly to not come here during this you know to our progression we need at least 30 minutes here so let's start that clock and hopefully we can make a decent amount of money in this time but like I said it's probably gonna be a bit scuffed so let's fire on into it I don't even know it's a prey it's gotta be range it's gotta be range it's gotta be ooh big hit to start us off pretty good first kill a little more food than it would have liked but that was fast Wow only four seconds over my PB look at that yeah we could selfie get another if I get to kill trips certainly I'd be I'd be over the moon with that as long as you can do it every time pretty solid kill we're going for another for sure demon out my shield on for that last hit there cuz I [ __ ] use my toxic blowpipe totally for guys that I could drop I mean how much have you made so far 334 K 3 kill trip a 3 kill trip look at that that's not even that good of a drop I don't think but if I'm pulling three kill trips this should be a breeze I'm actually slightly concerned that I didn't make my final budget high enough I feel like it should have been higher what's it two point eight mil whoa we're at one point six five in total over everything between vork hath and our Zora kills before so this is probably gonna be the last kill unfortunately because I'd have to tele bank come back and get the kill ooh and get the kill before three minutes is up and as you can see it's been taking me like two minute kills yeah and I haven't even tallied yet so this is gonna be it so for vork cath we actually did get 10 kills they were either two or three kill trips and didn't die once which I'm very happy about because that would have slowed us down massively if we died but 10 kills 1.3 4 mil from vork cath and 2.5 5 mil in total so far I I definitely underestimated the final gear stood up just a little bit but also I don't know what exactly I would have swapped it out for as I was progressing during vork at that was like should I put some Venom's in there and you've been thinking about it I have so many brews and I did the math you get so many heals with those brews that it's probably better just to have bruised and venge runes especially if they break the vent or the pretty low hit so you're thinking about and pretty happy with the bruise but I'm not happy that I didn't you know expand my budget just a little bit but I guess it is what it is were still like 300k short of the total amount that we need but that is for cath finished on to the next monster I think I'm not vastly under dumb myself I think Kings is gonna turn up with a better peek Hanks up now I really thought what I went for 1.8 million well get everything oh my god we're gonna go do broadcast next and let's be honest war cats probably gonna make all the money I need in the half an hour we only need 600 K more if we get it in that time then I don't need to do any more but I'm gonna be fuming with myself for not going for higher take yeah okay let's start this and start killing some vodka there we go first vork a third down what are we gonna get death runes 427 of them very very nice yeah not a bad care at all actually I have way too much in my imagery but I'm just gonna keep on fighting and we'll pick it all up at some point later on and not bad either 145 time I haven't done much walk after ever like 170 toe or when I hardly ever do it so that's not a bad time for me I don't think kill number two I think that was even quicker yeah 139 and really not a bad kill again very happy with that 260k total already what calf should sort out all my money problems and I'm gonna be a dad after two tasks that's ridiculous I have way undersold myself and I am very fuming about it there we go another kill that's not great that is not great at all I'll tell you that really night bar they're disgusting so the next monster we have is rune I'd dragons now we only need like 300k like I said and these guys are definitely more than 600 K hours so we should be able to complete our setup after this task alone still very stressed about my gear setup but even when thinking about it this there's really not much I could have added even if I wanted to because barrows is pretty high tier in itself just it just happens to be really cheap it's not like I could upgraded from a room crossbow unless I got a really lucky drop but again if I didn't get a lucky drop then I can't use any weapon at all if I don't get like a dragon crossbow for example if that's what I went with so looking at it this type of challenge it it probably was better to be safe than sorry because he could really [ __ ] yourself over in the long run so I'm sitting here stressing but I think I think my plans pretty solid and even looking back I'm not sure how much I would change it even knowing that I'm gonna have more I would have had more money to spend essentially with about 10 seconds to spare we kill our last dragon Wow so we killed a total of 23 23 Dragons killed for a total of 764 kay wow I think I underestimated all the money-making GP per hour that all these methods were just realized I didn't sit my [ __ ] super combat for a whole like two kills but that is gonna be killing number four and we're gonna get more death rates very very nice that it's gonna be a total of 456 K literally just from this trip so I need to make like a hundred and fifty HK one more trip of war casts that we're gonna be dubbed here guys I'm fuming I just hope raagh massively overshot and you know thought he could get like some mad gear and he's gonna come up short and be missing slots and stuff that's the only thing I can hope for here because we're gonna complete the gear in an hour kill number five coming in and it is gonna be a fairly decent kill actually yes very nice that sounded incredibly weird yes very nice calm down link there we go it's another kill and it's a dragon plate skirt that means we've made enough guys I don't have to kill anything else anymore that is crazy how quickly I've made that GP if we pull this over as you could see we made to just over two mil just over two mil in if we pause the clock like 45 minutes crazy there we go let's let's go ahead get the gear together and fight kittens so we have three point three one mil in the price checker and of course our final gear setup was only around 2.8 so the good news is that we smash the goal that we've you know but that we had we flew right past it we saw one monster left but the thing is guys we can't actually upgrade any gear we have so there's absolutely no point in me killing the last monster so yeah I I am bit stressed that I probably would have had like an extra mil to spend if I tack on what I would have killed for 30 minutes which probably would have been brutal black dragons because they also have the extra 500k from you know killing the rune dragons so I'm estimating I'd have like an extra mil but yeah it is what it is and we're gonna go in the fight with our setup again we're gonna be tanked range I think as long as he doesn't go full-out melee we should be okay can't really see him doing that to be honest but he might who knows maybe he thinks I'm gonna go tank range and he might say you know what let's try to counteract that but I do have those bruise I don't know if he's gonna also bring Bruce of course that sacrifices a bit of my DPS but I figured you just get so much more eats and I also have to ranging pots and that setup that we had before so a bit of an experimental one it's an all-out tank pretty good defense that's all around and some hard-hitting bolts maybe he'll forget something like anti poison or maybe he'll bring Dragonstone bolts and I have the ANSI fire pot so whoo anything could happen guys and I will see you in the final fight kids kids kids how was that for you guys dude all I have to say was I did not make my budget big enough and I actually didn't kill my last must to shame I already killed one and a half a lot better that makes you feel a lot better okay wait wait wait wait wait wait did you get like a lucky drop or something no because I I think I just massively under-budgeted night okay then I think it's time we at least reveal our total monetary budget that we had okay you go first cuz I feel really right right I'm gonna type it above my head okay okay you just got you exact are you just going so close I'm gonna round down but I always like to start Mary Kay over so make it matter oh my god where did you go oh my god my guy's gonna be like 900 k did you do I'm gonna assume just because it would have been really dub not to that your first two monsters or your first at one point five monsters or Zorro and board gap yeah okay and I massively underestimated how much money I was gonna make for them they I thought like 2.5 3 mil was the roof like I was like I'm not making more than that and so I went one a I stayed safe and I was like I'll just make sure I get everything did you get everything yeah yeah are you finished early didn't you [ __ ] yeah cuz I finished early so we could have gone for like three point five maybe four yeah you see there but I'm not even really sure how whatever upgraded of my gear with an extra Miller - well I guess - no would've been easy but extra mill I I really don't know I mean this may be slight changes but nothing like hugely drastic right no okay well I don't want to [ __ ] League run this from me I feel amazing let's let's linger for a solid ten more minutes and in this mindset okay alright kids right choose your first item let's go with helm I think this is I think this is normal but maybe this is where I've been an idiot and link you gotta go for the prayer bonus man isn't it less it's not quite as defensive though I think you lose start somewhere yeah but it's still maybe it's like one or two [ __ ] okay alright maybe I'm an idiot I don't know okay like a shield kittens all right all right this one's a bit pricey so I'm gonna say you might not have this just based on your one point eight mil budget less okay this is only 100k how much was that like 750 Wow okay so that just might be the difference there well he's still got about two or 50k difference yeah that makes me feel a bit badly oh yeah although this is like you know a dragon square that's like a room kite I just made that up really they look very similar honestiy told me that wasn't normal when I would not be looking at this closely I see it now slight tinge a slight tinge difference yeah that's very slight yeah Wow okay um [Music] I'm gonna go boots okay I went with Brandis boots and I also I can't yeah Mike's weeks she's really good all around very high range defense yeah correct correct no great bonus yeah let's go Kate yeah cool this I'm gonna assume you probably don't have but I could be wrong this was this would have been the first thing I would have dropped it's not my okay maybe you did get it and yeah wow so you're she actually I keep I keep thinking you have a blessed be your shield that's right you don't know I was gonna say Wow still though that's like 650k yeah I don't know where you've spent this money [ __ ] okay dude that's like one-third your your budget [ __ ] okay I'm gonna go with necklace nori yeah yeah okay it was hard to upgrade thought it was so expensive other than that yeah it was a bat or bust yeah unless you got lucky and wrists it for a fury but now I'm good let's get likes Mike guessing you went with the live Eric yeah I know he knows how it tore excite okay all right I have an idea on where we're going yeah I think it's quite obvious link I'm gonna go with body man let's go body I think I know where you're going with this I'll bet your money so I just throw it on like okay now what did you think I had like a [ __ ] orbital chain body link something ah dude that's like three mil isn't it that's bold you don't get that you rock up with nothing in the fight I also have a black D hi body I actually started with a Bandos but that I remembered no treasure Trailz but this is cheaper so I figured so like you're 2.8 million Allah with all that like I actually have it on me it was with that but I made an IC yeah so it's it's a downgrade but it's the same stats I'm just an idiot he spent like two mil on your weapon which I was a bit worried about when that came out okay we gloves then okay all right uh I mean pretty straightforward also also black D hi I [ __ ] up wait are you hydrated me link these are cheap these are these are like it like literally 1/10 the price inhabits well I don't matter oh your choice by your choice okay I'm like a ring okay obviously don't see this so I actually went for a grand I trained oh I love recoil I decided to go the recoil my granite pop in my head but I I thought my budget was pretty high and I'd even look up the price of a granite 20 crunches oh wow but I'm it gives an a range bonus age range defense bonus I was like maybe worth it so yeah you're like a shield there you know and I think I think with our budgets unless now I was actually scared that you would have a very similar budget set up but a big weapon like a dragon crossbow but considering the remail isn't it no it's I think it's like - something that's quick to point 6 like it's possible but yeah no I mean we know what's coming yeah put it on what both sigh let's try it won't bow all right okay so I actually have two types of bullets link yeah I thought you buy it [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] you don't have any poison Deva I died yes and I have Dimond as well [ __ ] I guessed and I went with aunty fire oh dude I figured I figured you thought I might have done that from spirit season 2 and I also have an aunty fire pot on me yeah okay so I have an ad to fire pot myself Oh Charlie votes no let's get the full inventory set up [ __ ] I don't know what was going through my brain I've messed up in parts here though I really didn't need to I'm looking at my food and thinking I could've done a little bit better here really yeah so love a few with myself okay there's food situations a bit low okay yeah so I mean I've got a super restore okay isara bro okay arranging part okay and an anti fire mix because it does heal food and I was like that's actually pretty smart I wasn't that score I can tell you that I have a yeah basking in potion is that was actually how to WoW the antidote yeah extended yeah diamond bolts yeah and Sarah burns and restores I wait I thought you were gonna do that too man that's so much heals lay not even I swear to God YouTube you spec musical like a 3540 I do die I was like dude I'm not good at Peking I mean I know you weren't either but I'm just thinking like be a tank the whole time and I'm stoked that you don't have an T poison stoked yeah yeah I'll bet we have to do this already outlast well I have to make sure I don't kids surprised he didn't bring any uh any spec weapon I get I just want to tank I even I even contemplating with vengeance but I was like I I give up so much heals is it worth the extra heals that I give up because I think avenged PK as like an extra ko potential right not not a tank test so interesting yeah dude okay I gotta watch that spec right bit bit nervous bit nervous let's do this and as always guys there is another episode over on rogues channel we had to kill eight different monsters we had 25 kills of each monster but if we killed the same monster all loop from that monster was taken it off and we had to then use like loop from the other monsters that we didn't kill the same one of it's a little bit difficult to explain but it's a bang over an episode so go and check it out in ROG's channel link is in the description too to click over after you're done watching this one but now kids we have a fight yes we do yes we do and whenever you are ready alright I'm about to fire in man oh let me know when

up my ball to Mac she bitten her are you poisoned yeah dude that's [ __ ] up slow this this fights gonna be I thought this is gonna be a quick fight like it you know a lot of zeros but a lot of like thirty fives twenty fives like that oh my god yep eat eat eat eat did nothing did nothing good legit I'd I I'm so surprised and I think your methods gonna completely win this I thought I'd be hitting

damage that's what I need to see my end so working now thank God for the poison man ok in fact yeah I can't believe that that's gonna be the difference here I can't believe this I thought it was going

believe this genuinely like this is meant I don't like this at all man this is mental like we should be hitting I know we're tanky but we should be hitting I know especially with rigor room crossbows what this is crazy absolutely crazy you hit that okay yo that I didn't think you had spec or did you save it never know mate you'll never know okay nice nice nice feedbacks this is mental genuinely I thought this is gonna be a really action-packed fight things are gonna go down nope see it [ __ ] full HP Wow yes yes let's try to get some more poison in but I'm scared that the emeralds are gonna do there we go and that's the poison proc he's happy happy man really AM man boobs get a bit nervous at first I don't know why but I have a lot more food than you but some hits of course my stats are a bit lower and I guess you do have more range defence right thank God my team boys disappointed isn't that the lowest hit 8/8 like you can't hit lower than like values nice a guaranteed hit a a son like your defense is totally negated it's just on its bottom here you're right right right whoa I escaped oops game over here kids is this No yeah Wow okay good let me feel a little better it just sucks with all the [ __ ] eating of the bruise on my end there we go I want to risk this slow I don't think yeah just oh but you have aspect that quick and I could easily eat up a little bit they're getting all the [ __ ] Prague's not really hitting though no we have a hit place come on just secure it just secure it come on get the hits get the hits we need this fight is just nerve-racking [ __ ] slow man what are you out and to eat up either you know oh man it's been so [ __ ] the dog both been so pointless so pointless they can't even eat that fast up bruise Shh I'm few even I am sadly fuming I felt the dark I was actually gonna do work it's hit like a E and that's it I mean I thought of it but I was like in my head there's a reason why people don't dark bo PK really at high levels that was kind of my thought process on the matter they tried hey are you out of food and I've hit so many times in a row for [ __ ] sake my gosh thank you - wow that was way too close for comfort we're talking like three brews dude knock off yeah no dude I was getting a bit nervous I get a bit dude because the thing is is I spent so much time eating and even though I don't lose ticks like my my stats get drained yeah not like a hit I I think it would have been better for me if I brought one less pot and a half inventory of Bruce and then the rest maybe mansis wow dude [ __ ] don't let me down but I guess my DPS wasn't too bad in the end [ __ ] oh [ __ ] kids my congratulations thank you thank you sir that dark well your whole did that that's what was scared me because I couldn't eat fast enough and I didn't want to eat too much because of my stats go down yeah yeah he died and like knew it was coming out I'm like 35 HP II that was my mind the entire time $35 like Bob I've just hit just hit I'm gonna hit a every time a new inventory slots for you as well if you had one okay spec though anyway damn geez there is another PvP over from rocks channel where I'll see if I can
