what do you will be playing today you go today we're playing five nights at Freddy's VR I've never played the five nights at Freddy's game so this is my first time playing and scary games are very scary BR especially right now you're playing on like the widest like nicely nice audio the brand new in town yeah hopefully actually comes out they'll be they'll be they'll be your next controller support in front of live ones I mean it's got the nice loud ass headphones so in the phrase screams your ears you're gonna hear it we'll hear it out here speakerphone oh you just left there he is oh so when you see the camera fuzz that means something changed well another dudes gone every time the camera changes every time the camera does that little buzz the noise that means something's changed or someone's moved all right I got two dudes on the loose walking around these robots some really solid robots who's that guy just who's the better but you're looking dude how the hell did it take three years before this was a VR this game is like me prove er I got three robots on the loose oh that guys in the hallway that's hallways right next to me oh this guy's in the hallway all right next to me oh yeah a decent writer just look at him what that guy's super close not - oh your collar life what if this guy show up turn that light off save some energy electricity is really expensive here it don't sound like the guy you got you got I jump we were doing one death right well top sorry one desk might as well like ones enough I mean five nights in heaven right now man all right anything you know I know the gist of it you pretty much you check the cameras when things get close you close the doors you check the lights but you want to keep everything off whenever you don't you gotta make you 6:00 a.m. we thought you got maybe it's the same without using only electricity oh it's so much smaller in here than it looked when you were playing me go yeah that's a nice little cozy desk also you put that phone on speakerphone oh yeah it's the red button so you just hung up on them I want to hear anybody all that valuable information now god I mean I wanted to set the phone down well then speak your bra like what's the point of holding it although you hit the phone so I'm here well you can just stare some snow all day you know dude it sounds really good in here and I'm not even full you're in it right now I've got you guys like you don't even looking at your monsters you're just your content and your blissful ignorance where's my sweet they're all gone links in description did you ever get any work done no I don't play very many seeded experiences but this is pretty pretty solid hello looking much much more manses three of them there yeah there's one more he's behind a curtain wait for three no there's one guy behind that curtain what you shut up mm-hmm all right so there's three suckers here it's Freddy this chica who's the private again you know their names huh

curtain speech don't tell me that yeah that guy oh my god chica he's on the move chica oh no oh no no no no no the trigger thing is like home basket switch okay Freddy still just chilling are you eating good man oh boy oh boy value gives you it helped but it also makes it way more scary so it's like you have to balance seizing earlier oh my god earphones oh my god they're getting closer Freddy's here Fran do you think these gonna scream oh [ __ ] tough guy up for us oh [ __ ] easier I think he's gonna scream already at one scream la yard oh oh you know ways to power did you did you really need a pee-pee you knew you think chicas here whoo oh that's wasn't part of the game before let you close it wait you closed the door yeah you don't either close anymore Oh chica son you're

there's a guy right there ah [ __ ] Jesus Christ all right it's cool it's cool you d look behind you okay it's cool it's cool okay how's this I'm like the one gets in the room we'll let us be there why did he let me close the door again I don't know chica FBI's got a battery oh I don't think you can make it to 6 a.m. no I got it oh okay what the get out of here I'm [ __ ] this this is a bad idea why didn't we decide to play this game I don't know man okay yeah like can you make the 6:00 a.m. I can only imagine how hard the later levels are Jesus yeah dude just batten down the hatches he got 10% it's 5:00 a.m. just close her up he's like right there yeah his clothes are up I might be bad advice you know so but look at the time 5:00 a.m. [ __ ] you chica go Jacob good move it three two yes oh Jesus yeah kidding you didn't die you are still alive Wow VR that is so much more stressful because I played it on iPad you know I played it on PC but having to actually look around and the seeing the scale of them walking down the hall to you when I was looking at the screen like it doesn't look that small right but as soon as you're in there it's like everything's just like yeah here I'm right in this little like telephone booth it's pretty claustrophobic also the sound having a 3d audio and this headset is really intense good to see you guys at home get the scaler here it's like keep in mind that Niko's able to hit both buttons from a seated position so it looks way bigger than that in there but it's actually it's only this big I'll put the mask on that a good strategy oh they're gonna come here oh oh that's different do I do some of my mask on and like sit still is this the facial recognition also don't doors anymore I think you put the mask on whichever way - I see oh that's really cool - all you have is a light biomass one's gone oh boy that's pretty much done yes you do wear the mask huh that's you defense music box wound up what is that boy that's the music box do I need to like do that too like I don't know what do you say I don't know oh my God he's coming down with - all look at him look at him put the mouse started reject me supposed to do he said he said like a 5 minutes worth of dialogue - what did I say he said keep the music box wound up saying I probably discount if you need it and he said the lights don't worry by the power yeah maybe the music box guy doesn't care about the masks and that's why I need to keep the music box wound up or else he comes out after you as it comes out brain you gotta figure yeah alright well good luck to me I guess there's no batteries it's just a music box so if you go to camera 11 that's the music class how do you keep it Wow I think it's that music button so when you hit 11 it plays the music box yeah so oh the music about there's a limit to how much is Wow is it when you're playing you're unwinding it I guess so so you don't want to be playing the music box so you can turn the lights on on those cameras - something's close to me you sure turn the lights on you also put the mask on I want to use it when you put the mask on the pities aquiles there you go okay yeah the music effects one of them Oh grand check the music line down Oh your music boxes also I'm done reading fill it up hold it down it's coming out turn the light on what just coming out turn the light on then the TV screen turn your light on there you go you can wind it up and see oh I get it got it we're doing good [Music] just like a real security guard hitting the light buttons and holding your mask oh oh so did you put your mask on your mask on put your mask on I'm just gonna let me say it's time to put the mask on you guys switch off the music box oh you're right I do donate it's old time I'm in trouble guys you certainly are good swap the masks real fast and turn turn to channel he's here why did it wind it wind it so yeah I think they have facial recognition which makes them hunt down predators I gotcha yeah gotcha so I'm in Goa with masks as sloppy as that was it worked out boys it worked out you know you don't have to say that yeah you can change other camera oh my god oh my god oh you're okay okay you go on he thinks you're Freddie okay I'm Freddie Freddie here here oh boy um that's looks very oh my god dare you take your mask off do I need another wine do you think I think you might need it to be safe oh I thinking this whole bit kind of in your face so full wine you'll be good okay don't ask it oh that's gone mask on boys I think there's something to your left oh boy here's something why we can barely see anything I can barely see do I hear somebody walking here you oh you did it oh wow okay how we knew summer job super bud that's really awesome I like how they switch it up yeah they're like I thought I was done with that math ya know that's so scary looking through the mask and watching this stare at you that was really deciding with another one of our you I want you to specifically tell all the innocent people to lower their weapons low okay and go whoa-ho is that my gun like
