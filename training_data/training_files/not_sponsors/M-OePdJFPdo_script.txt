hey everybody out here sure welcome to the long dark interloper and it's gonna be series 1 episode 1 version 2.0 the reason why it's version 2.0 is because I got two episodes into the original interloper series and out on the blue YouTube took the first video episode 1 and cut off about 17 minutes at the end no idea why I viewed it myself several times after uploading it I even have a lot of comments about the wolf attack that I sustained just before making it to the garage and then a couple days later people were not getting any of that so I'm just I got frustrated I'm just starting the whole series over I am NOT gonna re upload that video or anything like that and have to run into the same problem again so let's just go forward and hopefully keep our fingers crossed that none that it's gonna happen to us again so interloper for expert players looking for the ultimate challenge and wilderness survival you start with the most minimal resources and have to craft everything you need to survive the world becomes more hostile the longer you survive allows for two active feats so we're gonna go with Astrid again she did get a fair shake in the last series free runner sprinting now burns 25% fewer calories gonna activate that cold fusion we get a permanent four degree Fahrenheit more bonus to our fields like temperature and here we go let's name this I don't know interloper the version 2.0 there we go let's see if that works alright let's keep our fingers crossed for a good spawn here guys Oh God oh we're uh we're long okay this might not be - you hate people I mean it's really cold out we're by this cave here aren't we yeah which should lead us to that should take us to Milton right or uh oh gosh I think so we might run into something decent in the cave though okay this might not be too bad I mean it could be worse at least we're at least we're warming up for a second all right let's make good use of this because we can get over to mystery Lake which is good grab some coal we don't have much on at all I think we're pretty much stuck with the same stuff we started with less and they at least give us a tin can all right that's that's coal is it uh maybe not maybe just a rocket it looks a coal can i that pick things up anymore okay maybe I can't I don't see my uh narrative okay it wasn't coal just my eyes playing tricks on me alright get through here ah some sticks lovely lovely sticks did we find anything is her dead guy over here anywhere no all right well this we have some high quality fuels for our fire we'll see where this leads us and decide to said if we want to move forward or head back to what where we came and trying to make it to try to make it to Milton I'm sorry mr. e like I melted on the brain picked up some good tips in the comments thank you guys I really should be killing more rabbits like he said there throw stones at I'm stun them kill them once I get some fire starting materials okay yep Marsh Ridge okay good God so we came out in a different completely different spot on for Lord that's okay make the best of it there's a rabbit actually I need to find stowed I don't really want to carry around a rabbit if I don't have to but I might I might do it just so I can drop it for a wolf keep the hide but if I can get some good gloves and well we'll get out of here as quick as possible here picked up a couple little birch marks there just for tinder it's a temp at still still pretty cold yeah we're getting cold quick all right I need to fight a stone if I can I don't think I yeah I'd like to throw a chunk of coal at this rabbit but might need some of that soon we get attacked but that's not gonna be enough to provide any type of a relief all right next question is do I want to stay here I don't want to go somewhere else oh my gosh I think I think I might go back in hard to say alright let's just keep going let's keep going you know have any matches at all this is actually a really pretty tough start this is it a very hospitable place because there's no like indoor structures other than those caves that we just left to keep us warm and you can't just keep staying in the caves you'll never get anywhere with that though I don't know you know maybe they will go for the railroad connector I don't know the possibility might be some good stuff over there as far off as cetas from the beaten path might find useful tools as well so I think maybe we'll do that once we find the not too familiar with this side of the map so there's a wolf down there not nearly as cold as I am because he's built for it but let's uh let's see if we can shimmy shake our way on down here which looks like we can't we just need to be careful not to sprain an ankle because they were s so well alright I thought I saw him yeah he's going that way good okay let's try to get past him as quick as possible there's the train tracks so basically what we want to do is we want to make it we want to make it downrange here I think I'm gonna head back towards mystery Lake the safest option I wish I could get that sapling but I can't I just don't have any any way to cut it now maybe we'll find something good in this little uh this little hunters blind over here hopefully but we need to keep moving I need to make it at least to the boxcars I think that's gonna be my best option stay with gosh I really wish I had something to break this down with night requires a hatchet or a hacksaw actually it should be a little more specific oh there's a wolf over there good thing I kind of came this way of course you're probably gonna be three of them just over this rise but no not this tub okay I see some moments where we definitely look like that that's about the only way we're gonna be able to until we find some antiseptic we're gonna be able to stop any infection if we get nibbled on okay starting a series out always always in this mode always makes me keeps me on the edge like I'm just I feel like a complete noob again when I start playing interloper there are a lot of other people out there who are really good at interloper I just happen to not be a person that's played much of it a lot of stalker a lot of Stucker not much interloper it's a whole different ball game really because they don't have rifles in it so we got some food here we got a rock so that's good we'll take everything here it's gonna be a hundred fifty calories another hundred fifty calories and another hundred fifty calories so that's good and another couple hundred fifty calories alright grab while we can let's get inside here anything anything please give me some matches oh well you do that get out there don't open it twice dead body yeah that is that a foreshadowing right there could be that making a cross here I don't know if I could even make it across here maybe shoot okay I'm gonna have to go around I think I'm gonna go this way sorry I for thirty or sixty percent that's not very good we're already up that I we got a little ways to go can't even see the boxcars from here so and we have the Dodger wolves which frequently frequently travel on the rail lines here they need to be extra careful make sure that I can always run at least why am I not able to run that far what's up with that because it might cold too cold to run that what it is good god this is a tough start not nearly as nice as version 1.0 which many of you probably will not see but some of you probably who always jump on these videos right away remember I got a nice desolation points to spawn out on that one but yeah thanks YouTube thanks for screwing up the whole series when I had a decent start I make mistakes I'll be the first one to admit that but that was not my fault okay I just can't pass pass up calories that's the thing even if it's gonna risk hypothermia I can't do it free calories like that just too important to have the this is typically up here where the wolf likes to run around won't be so bad if the wind wasn't cutting through us let's see if the wolf's out or not I'm not sure I don't see him anywhere all right is the are the boxcars gone no way they removed him off of interloper that's really holy crap I had no idea oh no there they are they just spawned it like no way all right oh yeah now 29% there's a wolf straight ahead of us but it's pretty far out it's like a good couple hundred meters out it was right up there it just turned around went back behind some a little bit of a rise there I'll put it on the side it very right side of my screen you see him right there yeah well at least you have some good eats that don't require any cooking or anything like that that's positive Wow really shocked at how long it took for those boxcars to spawn in I think this is a rock over here I'm gonna grab this as well okay a little stone two stones yeah we got three all right you know me and my aim when it comes to rabbits probably need about maybe about ten times that many rocks such a peaceful there's a nice little tower up there but there's no structure that you can get inside of it stay warm so it's not like Signal Hill over there on the Pleasant Valley unfortunately I just want to get the mystery Lake maybe get to the trapper's cabin straightaway probably be the safest bet to warm warm up the bones and then we'll move from there I'm just gonna keep moving quick try to get across mr. Lake so on and so forth all right let's head over here grab these to 39% risk frostbite risk damp yeah cuz my head's not this is a lot of calories though right here okay let's go we got to get inside here and start a fire somehow or at least not zero degrees I hope there's fire starting materials in here if not it's going to be cold are these salt I was gonna say are they all sealed up - we got a flare so we could technically start a fire I'm probably I'll have to use that for a fire actually and a hoodie we'll take it that we need - we're gonna have to use the flare to start the fire unfortunately so yeah let's do it oops completely bump the wrong wrong key - I do have a start I got a flare really they're gonna let me they're gonna let me start a fire with a flare oh my gosh do I have to start you have to strike the flare I don't want to try it I don't think I've ever had to be in this situation I'll try start striking the flare and didn't see if I can use it I think I can now maybe yes okay that makes more sense thank you my goodness I was gonna be very shocked about that if that was an oversight though I would think if I had to flare it would just automatically light it for me but I've never actually had to start a fire with a flare because I've always had to we don't worry at least we get multiple chances of this right why didn't it work because it's interloper everything's trying to kill you every RNG mechanic there is stacked against you come offer me what what are my odds on this one 60% well I'm losing better than average coin flips forget little fire I want a big fire a big warm fire cook up a little water while we're here too and what I'll do here is I'll grab a let's add some fuel a bunch of sticks and we're gonna grab torches but unfortunately they probably ought to go out and this wind that's okay and then once it burns for a half hour I'll throw in some coal get this heat output real high and we'll really warm up warm up quick so but in the meantime let's go ahead and cook up some water cuz we have anything else to cook honestly so let's just do that Blair's gonna go out here that's okay frost Pete frostbite risk healed we are above freezing so that's good and pretty much just to throw that down for now catch the Boxcar hold fire let's drink that and then I'm gonna add coal as well and then we'll really get our warmth up here so let's just add a couple of these and now we're really cooking with peanut oil nice that's gonna make us get real warm real fast so let's just cook up a little bit more water here make sure we have enough in here two hours yep there we go and there we go so good on everything else food and fatigue and all that stuff so we'll take this keep doing this doing one hour 30 minutes or one out of three minutes I should say yes or probably screw at the screen oh oh one hour in 30 minutes 26 minutes we're gonna need to add a little bit more fuel here just gonna keep going here ok let's check our water situation [Music] it's pretty good should be able to get stuff from toilets and whatnot but we need to kind of get moving here and I also want to get a few torches here ELISA extinguish these oh wait there we go Oh holster holsters area that's what I want okay extinguish [Music] stay wish that we can daisy-chain these torches that's what I should have done in the last episode two guys are right [Music] and order everyone more there we go alright I can't even think of that flares burned out doesn't serve any purpose at all let's get going here piece of cold backpack it sounds like the wind died down a little bit so that was actually kind of helpful there's just a metal box here we're gonna check where we move any further probably nothing in it like most things but Oh dog food just some random dog food all right let's get going we got to get over to mystery like get inside get out of this frozen wasteland hellhole come out here negative twelve that's pretty frickin cold people that's pretty cold and the wind hasn't even started yet but it sounds like it is gonna get colder let it kinda just keep running here you can see that our conditions down pretty far because of how much how cold we were at the very start this isn't as bad as like a hush River Valley's spawn i i'm i'm so lost on that map anyway i've been there just enough to get what I need and get out basically and keep an eye on that torch make sure I can daisy chain these yeah it looks like I was too cold to actually run fast that was hurting my run that's why now I can actually run for the full statement of our stainless circle I guess okay let's get going let's get out of here epithermal your wrist starting to kick it again I'm gonna go ahead and I'll take it once I get off the X here from this wolf that sometimes controls back here I'm gonna go ahead and do a quick little let's drop a drop one of these and let's light this nope leave it yeah let's throw that down let's pick this one up and then let's equip it there we go light it off of that one all right let's keep going I'm not used to doing that okay remember which one you're supposed to sit down which was just to hold on to well let's keep you a little bit warmer to having the torch at least leave it leave for long muskeg yes please most definitely all right anything over here I mean green eyes people green eyes looking at me not that I can see okay oh hey we got some stuff over here probably nothing in them wow this thing's burned it out quick isn't it my goal is to get to the cabin off that one flare and be able to get the fire going for the night as well it's gonna be I'm gonna have to move quick though again frostbite infliction again alright we should be alright so the Tulsa toss this one down bring out one wide it and there we go alright see I read the comments I know I'm just so used to not needing to go that route because you know you end up swimming around with like 500 matches and the magnifying like three magnifying glasses and that sort of thing just don't the man there's a little birch well I'd so like to be able to take that birch but can't a dead guy over there being a dead guy here all right well is he always there I don't remember him always being there I like it though I like not knowing where things are gonna be exactly brings back it refreshes the game a little bit you know honestly I like I wish this game was procedurally generated and every time you load it up in sandbox it was like a whole new map like everything was just sort of randomly placed and that sort of stuff look kind of like unreal world something like that but I guess for what they need it to do for story mode it all that they really can't so all right let me switch out torches here yet again there we go and let's move keep all keep it all I don't really want to go down there oh it's such a warm inviting looking house you know what they're gonna there's no fire there though what's causing it to light up I'm sweet all bad there's the cave to Milton get inside it get this fire going on the stove I got a bunch of coal I could probably run back here and grab a bunch of coal too in this little cave it's kind of nice to have a constant coal supply right there but I'm gonna boil up as much water as I can that's really what I want to do with this I don't have to use another one remember my out man I'm kind of glad that I grabbed as many torches that I did am I gonna run out of torches or just like just right now okay no other light sources that inventory oh yeah yeah yeah see this one's a much better shape this is like a nice torch all right yeah we're good let's get inside let's go kill some rabbits out back - well ty get this fire going there should be some rabbits Tiffany - there's one right there - oh so we're gonna have some food tonight - some fresh cooked food I'll get the rabbits curing and we're not gonna mess around anything except getting it I wanted to free another nice we got a two burner we have to right recycle cans we're gonna be able to double up our output with this is I think this is even better start than the last one but hey 60% chance let's give it a shot here okay come on come on yeah we got it all right guys all right cool you know what I'm gonna go ahead and extinguish this because I can always turn it back on with this fire now though but we will add some fuel right now let's stir some sticks in there pretty good that'll get us to the point where we're using coal so and then let's start cooking up here a little bit of water yeah there's one select that you know what I'm gonna do it this one I think it's easy bro yeah by yeah there we go now we got em both on their water 13 cook 13 cook okay 30 minutes until boiled but we need to add fuel and I think we can add coal now at this point we didn't know fatigue we're getting pretty tired so I think we're gonna get about four hours of cooking oh is that potable it was puddle oh thank god it freaked me out there for half a second let's drink it lost track of where I was with the water Doty 19 okay there we go oh I didn't start it neither did I that was dumb that was so stupid all right let's try this again I completely screwed that up how we doing on water should be good on water pretty good yeah yeah that's that's that's pretty decent all right um go grab those rabbits real quick I think was it oh that's also put over here yeah I'll search it in the morning well search the cabin in the morning so I have an hour and 40 minutes so I should be alright - uh skin these rabbits up zooming I could find him now she'll be right over the sill they don't really go too far I'll today go in for the night you kidding me are you kidding me really they went down what you mean he actually let them go to sleep alright we'll grab some of this old man's beard yeah throw one and I'm gonna catch you rock oh no that wasn't how I didn't plan on that happening so that wasn't quite supposed to happen that way but put your rock away before you hurt yourself okay there we go there we go well I was playing it wait what's this oh that's just a rock a bigger rock all right so we're hungry but we have a lot of cattails so that's good at least our habits down here there might be some rabbits down here oh I can't even run to catch him so it's pointless to even try to stun them they're they're just kind of get up and run away before I even get to him so I'm too tired to hunt rabbits apparently oh well yeah let's head inside which time we got left here now it will do a little bit more cooking of the water of the old water just enough time pick up and pick up I think we'll be done with that all right time is it's almost morning that's all right that's all I'll say it did I take the bed out of here do that I'm so conspiratorial I think all right it's pretty sketchy dog food I don't think I'm gonna eat it gosh man all right I'll just have to have a computer these needed both yeah you need like sleep 10 hours you now need like 750 calories when stalker was like 600 left adjust my thinking on how many items I have to eat here I'm gonna need like one more okay yeah we should be good and I will need to drink some water which isn't a problem at all we're not carrying anything else no other equipment so at least we could carry water around everywhere and still be way under weight as you can see so this is basically our belongings right here what you see right here in this picture Wow okay let's do a 10 hour sleep and we should be good all right guys see you guys in the morning should be close to 80 85 percent help but now on mystery lake we shouldn't be freezing to death and really taking serious condition hits I should be able to survive pretty well here and get somewhat geared up home ah there you are where have you been all my life alright guys well now we just need a hacksaw but it'll look a sewing kit Hey okay well I'm kind of like of this playthrough already maybe even a little bit better fifteen okay let's like it wasn't as quick to get inside of applet oh come on okay so I was like 13 I didn't get inside a place quite as fast as version 1.01 on desolation point I just want straight to that lighthouse but uh overall I think we're gonna be in better shape when we walk out of mystery lake I think I'm Peppa sowed two or three we're gonna be in better shape okay wow that's that combination is really quick okay please give me something excellent take it I'll take it Oh a new wool scarf that'll be nice I don't think it prevents you from getting frostbite on your head I don't know if you get frostbite on your head I think you do right it's not just your fingers in your feet right okay let's throw that on got five degree warmth photos people okay so that's so set a really makes me want to start the whole series over okay Oh note left behind hey there's a pot next to the this is what the note says hey idiot there's a pot next to the stove in case you want to cook up any water yeah you know in case you come in freezing some night I'll let you guys read leave read that if you want to it's just from a from one of the Kickstarter backers so alright we'll take it we might burn it later just kidding I don't think you can do that with the notes and even in interloper and of course of course it's locked yeah you have anything else for me hey you do sneaky dog food not really perfect condition more like 46 percent of perfect okay let's do this let's get out of here where you guys want to go I think we go that's the type of agar Tory puffs yeah we gotta move that keep going I think we go gosh where do I want to go I think we hit mystery like the camp office I think we go there first because the weather's kind of looking like a little sketchy and that is a safe place of a storm since it sets in plus we have some more we do have some cattails in that immediate area as well and we have some buildings that are pretty easy to loot in addition to all that so if you look in here and not see anything you got this I can come back for but can't do anything with my bare hands a little too frozen at this point I'm gonna grab a couple rocks since I was naked negligently discharging rocks last night there's another rabbit there I want to leave that there because I don't wanna kill it and I carried it around while we go through wolf territory probably get chewed up by a wolf okay you gotta be a little careful come up over here oh you know what let's get a drink what am i doing so used to see an interloper I'm just so used to seeing everything in red down there I don't even it's like whatever all right exes last and okay hex you got anything good for me give me something great brother come on man they really go for one of those twelve ticks that the Dukes that the game gave me good version 1.00 you have even where to start a fire at this point I need to find some matches or at least another flare or something like that I hate to keep using flares so that purpose seems like a little bit of overkill but it's better than nothing obviously this is the way I used to travel the trapper olmstead long time ago a steed traveled this Ridge right here go up and over and then down and pass the dilapidated cabin down her not cabin but Bard whatever shed down here well it probably is there's sometimes wolves right in this area so you got to be a little extra careful yeah but it gave me a good vantage point to like kind of look down and see what all was happening down here that's a thought process anyway plus I can run for a really long distance now not weighed down by anything so I do have at least I got you know sort of speed on my side keep grabbin ease it might be important I can't believe that there's a pot sitting right next to the stove I had no idea that it even existed there I've never ever seen it there what I never thought to look there especially what he left like why would you leave a team tin can on the stove and then leave your pot next to stove but you leave your pot on the stove oh shoot I thought that I thought I thought that stump right there was a wolf when I just went like this because I heard something to my right ear and looked over there and I just got out freaking heart attack okay calm down get your bpm down below at least 175 got some rose hips here so those are gonna prepare to but like they say in interloper the wildlife is more sparse but the Predators are more aggressive another pot okay we can really boil up some water now really don't know need to know why I picked up the Tim KN but here we are maybe in case I get chased by a case I need to drop a decoy for like a killer goat or something I can just throw down a tin can like I said interlopers pretty much new to me for all intents and purposes so who knows maybe there are killer goats in this mode of the game okay see there I see the rail line over here kinda kinda where am I gonna run if a wolf comes at me that's my next thing I always like to have a place to run to at least like somewhere to flee up the downed tree or something like that I'm gonna go this way Oh God I hate coming up over this hill oh why did it come this way because I found a new pot that's why what oh my gosh I get chewed on here okay okay okay okay okay there's a dead guy over here we're gonna check him out real quick I don't know make sure there's no wolf up here before I check through that guy is that him right back to it okay let's just run down here real quick not super cold out right now interestingly enough that was pointless all right let me make sure I charge up my stamina enough in case I come around this corner and there's a wolf here I'm gonna have to you can try to fake him out as I run to the camp office right down here I would I would freak out if I came around this corner and that camp office was actually burned down it's one of the no there's a wolf straight ahead so I'm the track okay she's starting to get cold but she's alright she just she's being a little a little melodramatic right now alright twenty-one outside it's actually not too hateful for interloper at least my experience with it my limited experience with it okay got some rose hips straight outside here here we go alright let's go inside the cabin see what we got warm our boats up while we do a little bit of a search okay let's see another tin can that's throwing Tim gives us so that's gonna be how this huh all about team cans okay nothing down here on this stove another Tim can what's this over here looks like a speeding ticket magnified let's I just saw that sticking out not you're not kidding it's gonna come in handy some eagle-eyed viewer would have saw that and they would have told me that in the comments and I would have seen that around episode or something and I would have come back for that probably almost already had like two permits you making fun lenses I'd really like fishing line of course a pry bar would be nicer I got the hammer I could break the ice with a hammer oh yeah okay I'm okay I just need the fishing line fishing tackle more tin cans good god man they're everywhere bandage I think I have two bandages no no I think I've want some where did I I just imagine oh yeah okay maybe I was imagining things there's a wet stowed laptop here nothing okay well technically let me think yeah technically we could go make ourselves a hatchet and in a knife improvised hatchet improvised knife ah surprise outdoors let me take that book just so I can burn it later not the first one the second one what do we got here sports fest all right let's throw on what we got I think my not worried I'm not wearing this one or that one I don't know why did for the hoodie on yeah it would've helped out a little bit not much but okay well let's throw them both on you don't know what yeah I do oh there's nothing gonna wear it there okay gotcha okay all right well dark feel a little bit better especially with that magnifying lens I mean we haven't found any matches yet but honestly I probably found the best fire starter in the game right there so pretty good good just scrap it out of here oh my gosh cans everywhere we don't have to wait for sunshiny days now how do we all right it's it's coming along it's coming along we got a sewing kit I might want to break down that cloth let me stick here three of those yeah let's grab that we're gonna do some repairs great leather cloth yeah let's do it all right another one to ten minutes okay five minutes per right okay we got plenty of cloth for repairs I think we're in good shape there let's uh let's head down to the fishing huts see what we can find there sorry what's our weight at now 59 pounds oh we're starting to collect some stuff starting to collect some stuff slowly but surely okay let's head out of here hopefully the weather's a little bit more clear yeah it's about the same yeah maybe the snows let up a little bit but I'm gonna grab some are we doing on cattails we're doing pretty good on cattails yep right here the fabric of life cattails bleuer I think we're okay maybe I'll go for these ones over here there's a couple over here I just think like you know five cat tails is basically a night a full night's sleep of the full belly no that's that's huge it's low risk it's so low risk I kind of want to get over to calm and I kind of want to get over to uh I need to find a hat hacksaw now really so I can start getting some saplings get those curing I can get a bow up and run it that we can really start surviving a little bit better cuz uh there's really no point gonna well I guess I can I could craft my arrowheads beef before I even have them cured that's fine I can do that now I have to return to the forge but hacksaw would help because he could cut up some metal and make a lot like one sitting one visit to the fort but if we go to a coastal and live there good could last quite a while all right it's all right we'll get you warmed up don't worry haze or flare okay good uh hook nice it's just I'm back to my back to repeating myself from the last version one point out it's I need some line it's a line got light anywhere let's see any a little bit of a stutter there hopefully all these cabins aren't burnt down but we'll go up here and check it out nonetheless yeah and hopefully YouTube hasn't cut me off like four minutes ago okay at the 41 minute mark again gosh how frustrating this guy's not normally here okay so there so there are some new bodies oops need to double-check them okay it's probably gonna be one back here so no no cue feathers huh that's it that's all I get some sort of luck fishing book that makes sense another another look still no lied oh I think you should be able to take your cloth and make light out of that might not be the best line but that's 28 in here I'm not behind quite as fast at least okay poor guy right up we got one cabin left standing over here plus there's one a couple over here and one by itself but again not to worry about the hypothermia risk at this point cuz I don't want to be inside here pretty quick yeah we'll just eat the hang out for a minute till I get warm there any deer over here this time are they gone because we don't really herd of deer that like to hang out over here but I don't think so I think they killed him all right so let me ask you guys a question I'm not averse to Cheryl this there are the supply the underground supply caches are they available on most of the major maps in interloper or do they completely remove them from the game I mean other than the abandoned one at timber wolf Mountain because that one's less like a constant one I'm talking about the ones that rotate around I don't know I think I'd I think I need to answer that one time but it it's been so long ago I don't remember late Kevin's yeah let's get inside but dark in here anyway to really look around paper shelf trunk nothing worthwhile in their stress kid okay deck of papers can I craft a Minecraft a torch adhesive layer boil crap can I make just a really cheap torch like the kinda pull out of the fire that's kind of one on what oh look I had a book there somewhere or was it a plastic container idea what I'm looking at alright we'll take it chair leave Gavin bench well I can't see crap that's the problem I'll just check where I think I'm supposed to check best I can about the top of the bed and clothing up there okay well we might have to come back for that kind of think well let's just hang out here I'm gonna eat a little bit yes for the heck of it there we go add a little something to drink here and we'll just hang out here actually we'll get a couple addition points back that's a little bit of time you know what Mazal used to bed rote pastime get a little bit extra warm Otis it'll warm us up faster ease that wasn't very long let's try circuit oh no not sleep dang it I meant to do rest sorry that was I didn't mean to click the button ok let's not do that again that was pointless alright let's take a look out here I'm just gonna look in the it's really pretty out I'm just gonna go collect stuff now it's really cold isn't it yeah therefore I'm gonna check these uh since I can't search in air because it's too dark I'm gonna just check the fishing nuts over here there's like two more and then maybe collect some more cattails I can find some over here there's a couple there's a few over here old al well at least at least that's the same as stalker that oh hey it's beard I'll throw oh no I was like off the rock really yeah we got a couple well bears that's the bear isn't it yeah that's the bear doesn't easy gonna freak those wolves out they're all gonna come running at me that's not a good thing Eilish three three cabins here alright I think what we'll do is we'll head over here get these two fishing huts real quick if possible kind of where selves down a little bit more also sort of added bonus before the bear freaks these guys out then we'll come back here and rest for the night think it no wide nothing over there not that I could see dead guy over there though we'll slowly back away they grow up eh yeah see that wolves run it and that's right well standing actually no standing over here okay but still same basic same basic direction grab some of these feathers we're going to need it for the Harris that we're going to build three hours per hour three feathers per arrow I don't try to get up here well know their stuff up here I think I think I've this stuff up here all the time because I'm just too lazy to climb up here this pack is getting kind of heavy four percent hypothermia risk not too bad she's starting to get a little tired this I gotta be careful about that because I need to run all right let's try to skirt this way best you can we got a bear to deal with we got two wolves to deal with we're gonna be alright cuz we have we have running shoes on none of them can catch us just too fast for the feeling the bear and I are gonna kind of meet up nice he walking away yeah he's kind of circling around one of these days I'm gonna be hunting you promise you I will come for you one of these days the nice thing was I got myself nice and fatigued gear so I'll get some really good sleep wake up early in the morning when it's a light out and we'll hit these cabins and kind of go from there come on give me something good please be something worthwhile here after walking all the way over here that's good it's new as well do you see that I like it what's that piece of wool is that a piece of coal like I didn't even see it okay something look good worthless okay sir that all before I forget would love a degree work both look at that more than doubled kind of want to try to sleep in this cabin they hit these on the way back I don't know if I can get there with the bear walking around run try see what happens worst habits this we got attacked by the bear in this first episode it'll make a looking it will make getting attacked by two wolves look like child's play honestly at least at least it's not a killer goat but I'm well prepared for them I have plenty of tin cans drop his decoys for them alright she gonna turn around and she gonna keep moseying on I think I'm okay I'll be able to just run inside if he alerts on me anyway at this point he's gonna look he's gonna turn around here in a second I think yep there he goes watch no he stopped okay oh you kept going I thought he's gonna turn for sure just I don't know what he is maybe he's like a passive spare all right so it's going to eat I got 38 of those that's a lot that's really helpful actually oops we don't want to eat those those are too precious they can eat five I'm probably not gonna be able to sleep ten hours now let's look probably about eight hours but it'll be fine we'll be able to recover to 100% condition so much better than the last run actually I've lost track of how many I mean need to eat one more there we go probably don't need to eat this last one but we're gonna do it anyway yeah we're gonna drink then we're gonna get our sleep on let me make sure that my clothes calm we're out in the middle of the night now we'll just kind of suck and no nothing just right on the verge of breaking just these need repaired for sure so alright guys let's get some sleep here you guys think I think we'll do 9 hours we're gonna wake up fully rested for sure no worries on that yield there I've healed hypothermia risk and healed frostbite risk so we're good there and we're back up to what about 90% health not too bad you know what I'm gonna treat my character to just a little extra there's a little breakfast just to lift the spirits and we'll do a quick little search oh I thought she got food poison for that what she did uh I was like oh you're kidding me from cattails hundred-percent cattails no but it wasn't that it was just a coincidence alright books folks cuz we like to burn books yep I already got that anything under here oh wow interlocal why you gotta be so tough let me so mean all the time okay well there we go take a look outside see what it looks like see what the temperature is and give you guys an idea they're still moseying around out there he owns this area alright you can tell it you can tell the ice is just fine out there though at least that's the only only thing positive I could say about that any scaring away the wolves but then again how did I miss this it just appeared there it was not there when I first walked in or when I woke up yeah it wasn't there when I was searching I know it wasn't they just they just threw that up there I did not miss that well like comment subscribe I'll see you
