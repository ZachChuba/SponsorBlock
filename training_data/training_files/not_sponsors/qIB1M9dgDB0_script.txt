if Trevor Lawrence was coming out this year would it be job or job ro or Trevor Lawrence number one pick oh my god you would have to take Trevor Lawrence just because he's six foot six to twenty one two four four I could swing that fault how tall is Joe borough in person Joe Burrus like six three it feels like he was bigger yeah bigger in person than I thought in just like we saw at the SEC Championship when they showed him when we were in the stadium two and a half hours before the game he had a shirt on he has this awesome vibe about him just like very very confident like very very comfortable in his own skin very confident he had this smart I think he wanted to look over and talk to us while he's doing more most I like it had that feeling where I was gonna potentially have a conversation with him while you as well there's no reason we should have been working well hello there and get $20 off your first order from CT now back to the magic now there was no reason why they feel best we were allowed to just go wherever the hell we want I mean me and mineral lob ski was dead what two yards away from Trevor Lawrence warming up and then Adam Amin was standing behind him and we were breaking it down as if it was a play I write here's a warm-up Todd he's taking us to oh look at this he just threw the ball a little high there everybody's gonna get back on and this guy's trying to loosen up his arm at this point we're breaking down what a nightmare situation Joe's taller than you think he is but I think they would still take Trevor Lawrence just because he is like the prototype yeah I mean he is the protest generational aside from now Joe burrow might be a generational tunnel so we don't know how he's gonna do but I think at GM you gotta remember these GM's I want to keep their jobs too
