after spending almost two years as a pvp locked hardcore man and one year as a hard crime and hunter i have decided to return to being a hardcore in pvp worlds however this time my private will be on at all time my in-game name is how much for off and my bounty is on screen and it's consistently increasing every single day in today's episode we are going to do the final and most important preparations before we start gaining combat levels and one of the most important unlocks is 58 herblore for the herb sac look at that super energy potions we can now make them uh this is going to help me a lot in questing running around herbivore everything whenever i'm doing herbivore for herbs and hunter experience we occasionally get these unidentified fossils with these fossils we can get xp lamps which we can put on our hit points hitbox experience 2k hit post experience 43 hit points 22 combat 57 minutes in and we have only gotten two unidentified small fossils it takes our time but it's definitely worth it in the lane another very important grind i need to do is construction and the method i'm doing to obtain construction levels is mahogany homes it's a lot cheaper than the normal construction training methods and it's very hard for the hunters to track me down while i'm doing this give us the looting bag uh first skill count looting bag and that will be 45 construction for the six and there we have it 47 construction that's all we need for now amoled of glory uncharged beautiful we have now unlimited teleports to these four locations and i also want to build a study hall for 50k and we want the lichten right there so now when i get the magic level we can now make lumbridge teleport which will be a safe one-click teleport tablet and that's 50 construction we can now make a portal room in my house time to sell more items and make more money and we got 195k 100k for a portal chambers this is so awful so expensive it is finally time to do some quests to unlock some teleport we start with the ascent of our series and that's the ascent of arceus completed uh we can now teleport to our series and that should be the depths of despair completed and we have now unlocked another teleport which is launched by lancelium inosidius another trip to the west are the store for a nice 120k so i actually got myself 11 attack and with this 11 attack i can make an upgrade black dagger weapon poison on the black dagger we now have an upgraded poisonous dagger we got the black one baby all right we got a hard clue scroll uh we're gonna try to attempt to do this

he's watching me that's gotta be a hardcore ride that could have ended so badly if he could attack me i don't know if i could teleport away from that uh that position there as a penguin and that will be the cold war completed so the reason why i completed cold bar is because of this agility course this is a pretty safe agility course because if you remove your penguin suit you get kicked out oh my
