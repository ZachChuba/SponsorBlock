yo what is going on guardians and welcome back to another destiny 2 gameplay video hey in this video I wanted to hit a handful of things mostly just channel related and keeping up to speed with where I'm at what I'm up to and on screen though you're gonna see a bunch of gameplay from a good session I had on Tuesday just trying to get some of my crucible drops bang down on my hunter the sidearm in the gameplay is the lonesome which is dropping just about everywhere this season the one in the gameplay has full auto and multi kill clip as well as ricochet rounds and a stability master work the sniper is my current favorite sniper in destiny too called the omniscient eye from the garden of salvation raid this one has snap shot and outlaw on it before I get into the channel info I wanted to ask if can give me the opportunity to honor my father since Father's Day is this Sunday I was thinking about what kind of a gift I should send him this year yeah usually I like finding him a nice bottle of scotch or a bottle of gin to send his way something like that but I thought this year maybe it would be cool if I gave him some of the spotlight here on my channel instead so I shot him a link to this video for him to watch so here it goes pops I wanted to thank for always being supportive of this really weird career path I chose but but even before all this when I was growing up thanks for not diminishing or trivializing my love for gaming always supported it and enjoyed spoiling me and my brother with consoles and new titles that we fell in love with and ultimately led me to being here where I am now so one of the things I have to do in this line of work is network with peers in my field and manage a community as well and I was well equipped to do that because taught me that all people have value regardless of their ethnicity their gender their upbringing socioeconomic background whatever defining traits they may have I still remember to this day one time literally pulled me and my brother away from our games one afternoon to have us practice having a polite conversation with a new acquaintance and I thought it was so bizarre at the time to practice that but here I am now decades later realizing that I was I was really well equipped and prepared to be successful in this line of work largely due to the way that invested in me and instilled in me all the skills I needed to thrive so thank pops I love I hope I can continue to honor and God in the way that I managed my career and raise my kids and love my wife alright do think thanks to y'all for bearing with me and allowing me to do that I'd encourage to take father's day as a chance to reflect on mentors in your life that have invested in in a big way and take a minute to honor them in some way too so moving on to some channel related things first and foremost I wanted to apologize for the pace of uploads here on the YouTube side of things in the past few months we were in an awesome groove and uploading regularly but then know Cova decided it wanted to literally jack up everything and put some serious restraints on my capacity to edit and upload with kids being home all the time and I have my contractual obligations that have to be or they all had they have to take precedence as far as Facebook goes know they treat me really well and they've been really great to me in my stream community so I'd encourage sometime come to the page say hello interact with our community there I even upload short videos there sometimes too and that's the number one best way to support me these days is hitting the support button over there none of that support revenue goes back to Big Facebook right it it all stays internal with the gaming program and they're really great guys it's a real small team of great dudes but almost all of it goes straight to me but anyways hopefully a s society starts to find its new stride in the wake of kovetz arrival I can find a new stride in my upload schedule too so thanks for your patience next thing I'm taking all next week off I've been pushing myself pretty hard for the past few months now with no breaks so next week I'll have no screams no uploads it'll just be a week of me hanging out with the kids and doing fun stuff to help them feel like life is a little bit normal to also you've probably noticed the viewsonic elite logo at the beginning of every video and in the upper-right of each video for the past year they've been so dang good to me and have given away some really cool stuff here to guys our viewers this year and I enjoyed that relationship enough and they enjoyed it too so we decided to keep moving forward together this next year as well so you'll continue to see their branding here and there and I highly encourage guys to check out their products next time you're in the market for a new monitor I have I have four I have four viewsonic elite monitoring I love them they're like Ferraris of gaming monitors now in terms of content for the future of the channel I would tell to continue to expect destiny related content I've even been doing like PvE help like raids and dungeons lately on both PC and ps4 on stream so feel free to drop by any time if want to see what we're up to and see if can join me I'd be happy to walk anybody through raid dungeon stuff like that we just do raffles on screen to pull people in to keep it all fair and balanced and your chances generally get bigger because we try to limit them to people who have never done it before that way we can teach them and equip them so that they can help their friends out to sort of pay it forward kind of thing but anyways we'll also be still doing PvP stuff like trials survival quick play for fun may also see some apex legends gameplay from time to time yeah I love apex I do I play it both on PC and I'm ps4 on and off stream regularly yo me and KJ Hovey and Jason have really been digging ranked apex lately we've played it on both platforms getting to some pretty good grooves it's just a really fun game with like no downtime know start a search for a match on apex legends your boots are on the ground in less than two minutes it's not like destiny where have sometimes five minutes at least between matches know so may see some of that here on the channel as well and lastly I wanted to remind that from time to time I will do sponsored videos I'll try to stick only to products that I think will relate to know I'm to be honest I mean I have a number of products that were promoted actually by my peers on their channels and when I saw their promotion and the deal that was being offered I said heck that sounds like a pretty good deal in it for know a decent product why not and I should picked a couple of things up so I don't think it's it's it's not like they don't have any value at all for viewers they certainly do if it applies to but that being said if are personally offended by ads they make feel violated know whenever see them well when when see me start talking about a product here in the channel just just know it's generally most people are asking for like a minute to two minutes normally it's around 90 seconds know so they want it to start around 30 seconds into the video and then they want it to be around 90 seconds long so you're you're usually looking at just dragged straight to the two-minute mark and maybe like two and a half minute mark know if want to be safe and you'll be right back into it it's totally skippable it's so easy so if don't like it these Vitesse ads are not like the unskipable ads on youtube know that you're like where's my skip button it's not like just drag it you'll be done it's super easy that's sort of the formula to look out for some letting know that ahead of time because all those videos I'm actually not allowed to tell on the video skip to this minute if know it's part of the contract I'm not allowed to tell where in the video the ad stops and I can't put it in the comments see that that's other people can but I can't so I'm letting know the formula now so that if are instantly not interested in that product just drag to about two two and a half minutes and it should be gone by then if not it's counting down to the seconds until it is done usually someone has commented in the top comments section a timestamp for so save yourself some time if hear an ad and you're not interested just scroll down click the timestamp scroll up done easy peasy it's literally a matter of two seconds to get past it so that's the formula I'm letting know now but a lot of people ask why do even do those people hate them though not all people hate them but honestly they're great deals for creators they really are I mean I get my hands on products for free that help me do my job better unless it's know like a manscape promotion that'll help me do a different job better but they also help me justify keeping the YouTube channel cranking because honestly they pay really well know sometimes they'll pay your mortgage for a month just for one ad it's it's really really nice so a lot of people like why would do that just it's not a sellout thing it's just a really great way to help content creators continue to make content and invest back into their channels so I hope y'all understand that most of do have but some of might might benefit from an explanation of what that whole system is like so thank so much for Barents me on that if I'm thinking right now it's like I won't do more than like two a month know maybe maybe if there's a month that's really bad know I gonna stretch it three whatever but there's 30 days in a month and I might have two videos out of that whole month they have a promotion of some kind on its own I won't go like shoving them all down your throat anyways okay one last thing I think before I sign off numbskull the people that are in charge of making the stranger statue for the the pre-order special edition stuff for destiny too they were super kind that this is not an ad by the way that I'm not paid or anything they sent me one of these statues it looks really freaking cool I'm just gonna tell it looks really freaking cool it has a permanent spot on my desk now it's freaking BA so I'll just show some pictures that that's something you're interested in maybe were on the fence about it here's some photos can see what it looks like it's ten inches tall it's just under a foot it looks great so can see that up close and see if that's something might be interested in I feel free to look into it I have it and I got it for free so that's why I have it and it's awesome so I didn't buy it anyways alright that's basically it for me today oh thanks for being awesome I love all I hope continue to stay safe during this like really confusing year take your health and the health of others seriously please try to learn more about our world since so many people these days are acting out of ignorance and they're hurting themselves and others just by not doing their due diligence to educate themselves and this isn't talking about any specific thing just a blanket statement for a blanket of issues that we're facing these days in 2020 so please be warm and well fed my friends I hope to catch in the crucible
