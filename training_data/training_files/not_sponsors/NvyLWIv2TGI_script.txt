sponsored by brilliant Apple has come under fire for how they're handling China and Hong Kong u.s. president Donald Trump and Russia and Crimea some have accused Apple and Tim Cook of betraying their principles for greed and abandoning customers who placed their trust not just an apple products but their ethics and values others have praised the company and their CEO for doing their fiduciary duty following the laws of all the various lands and preserving important markets and shareholder value still others have seen it as Apple caught in their own expansion trying to navigate an impossible balance between political turmoil corporate interests and social and customer responsibility now that fire is becoming an inferno how close can Apple play it without being frozen out or burned I'm Rene Richey and this is vector Apple is no stranger to controversy surrounding China from removing VPN apps that allow for the circumvention of the Great Firewall - removing the Taiwan flag emoji that hurts one china feelings most recently on October 9th reuters reported that Apple had removed HK Maps dot live from the App Store an app that let protesters in Hong Kong tracked police movement Apple had originally rejected the crowd-sourced app then approved it only to remove it after the Chinese Communist Party's official paper called the app poisonous and accused Apple of being complicit in helping the protesters Apple claimed many concerned customers in Hong Kong had contacted them about the app endangering law enforcement and residents and so Apple had begun an investigation and ultimately removed the app Tim Cook wrote a memo to Apple employees explaining the decision saying in part it is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill this case is no different the app in question aloud for the crowd-sourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints protests hotspots and other information on its own this information is benign however over the past several days we received credible information from the Hong Kong cybersecurity and Technology crime Bureau as well as from users in Hong Kong that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present this use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law similarly widespread abuse clearly violates our app store guidelines barring personal harm the developer took to Twitter immediately to deny the accusations saying there was zero evidence to support them John Gruber questioned the evidence as well then added I can't recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny for a company that usually measures unten times before cutting anything it's both sad and startling Charles Mok Hong Kong's IT legislator accused Apple of putting profits over values Peter Kafka of recode explained those profits also came with dependency saying that even if Apple was willing to forego the forty four billion a year in sales it makes in China they can't leave the deep network of suppliers and assemblers that build hundreds of millions of iPhones every year Morgan Stanley's KD Huberty points out what could be seen as part of a larger plan that Apple likely has done a lot of work with suppliers to shift production of some of its products away from China if trade tensions between Beijing and Washington continue to escalate when I asked industry analyst Ben baharon of creative strategies for his thoughts he said that you abide by local laws because that's what you have to do but you engage while you are there and get little wins when you can to drive change Neal Sai Bart one of the most consistently accurate financial analysts covering Apple has said similar there is no playbook for Apple management to follow when it comes to leading a trillion dollar company with a billion customers around the world cooks decision to engage Apple will mean that there will be more controversies such as HK mapped live Apple may not be completely ready for such controversies but the company will likely be willing to confront them such a stance shouldn't take anything away from Apple's steadfast pursuit to leave the world a better place Tim Cook has also faced criticism for participating in Donald Trump's Technology Council and for having private phone calls and dinners with the US president Apple has a vested interest in US trade taxation regulation and other policies the to stand far apart on other issues from climate change to immigration policy to civil rights it came to a head on November 20th when President Trump toured the flex owned plant in Austin Texas the one that's being retrofitted to assemble Apple's new Mac Pro here's how the New York Times reported it it was a pretty typical publicity event until the end mr. Trump walked in front of the news cameras and took credit for the plant suggesting it had opened that day for me this is a very special day he said Mr Cook stood next to him stone-faced the plant has been making Apple computers since 2013 immediately after mr. Trump's comments mr. Cook thanked the president and his staff I'm grateful for their support in pulling today off and getting us to this far it would not be possible without them he said he did not correct the record that part not correcting the record the facts the truth was the main problem for some industry analysts karoliina milanesa of creative strategies put it to me this way of course you don't contradict the president during a press conference but Apple should have said something afterwards both Tim Cook and Apple has set the bar quite high for themselves so they are being judged accordingly for others the problem was political John Gruber said he was on board with cooks carrots and engaging President Trump on the council and in private phone calls and dinners because none of those implied support but appearing alongside Trump at an Apple facility in a staged photo op his implicit support for Trump and his re-election The Associated Press reported that Apple announced they would continue having the Mac Pro line made in Austin after the Trump administration agreed to waive tariffs on certain computer parts from China Ben Thompson said it was an explicit manifestation of his fears we have a major American corporation making product decisions where the Mac Pro is manufactured and putting on dog and pony shows to satisfy an executive primarily concerned about his own re-election that's the part Neal Sai Bart zeroed in on cook knows exactly what he's doing he is no fool who found himself walking straight into a photo opportunity seemingly unaware he knew how this would go down all the way to Trump taking credit for quote-unquote opening the Mac Pro factory that was all part of the plant as seen with his own comments on the matter to the cameras yesterday this is no longer just about tariffs instead cook is playing the long game Apple and any other trillion dollar company will face its share of obstacles in the years to come when it comes to Washington we are seeing cook learn how to play us administrations regardless of who was in power from the BBC November 27th 2019 Russian forces annex Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014 drawing international condemnation the region which has a russian-speaking majority is now shown as Russian territory on Apple maps and it's weather app when viewed from Russia but the apps do not show it as part of any country when viewed elsewhere Vasily Piscotty of chairman of the duma security and anti-corruption committee said that Apple had complied with the Russian Constitution that labeling Crimea as part of Ukraine territory was a criminal offence under Russian law he said there is no going back today with Apple the situation is closed we have received everything we wanted Vadim Mistico Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine too cried the move on Twitter let me explain in your terms Apple imagine you're crying out that your design and ideas years of work and peace of your heart are stolen by your worst enemy but then somebody ignorant doesn't give a damn about your pain former chess grandmaster and political activist Garry Kasparov also tweeted about it saying that was a huge scandal regionalization of facts is unacceptable appeasement John Gruber added Apple can argue honestly that they're complying with Russian law by showing Crimea as part of Russia to Russian users but complying with this implicitly means capitulating to Russian propaganda kneel sigh Bart took exception saying Kasparov suggestion would require Apple to turn into some kind of political entity dictating how governments around the world should behave and act Apple stands for certain ideals something Tim Cook continues to do it pretty much every opportunity he is given however that is very different than deciding which laws Apple will follow or ignore Karolina milanesa told me part of it is the price of doing business in China and but holding Apple to a higher standard there must be a point where Apple wants to draw a line in the sand which we might actually now be seeing sooner rather than later given this week's reports of Russia wanting apps pre-installed on phones sold within their borders Apple PR acknowledged the changes to the Maps app inside Russia but threw in a hope bone we review international law as well as relevant US and other domestic laws before making a determination in labeling on our Maps and make changes if required by law we are taking a deeper look at how we handle disputed borders in our services and may make changes in the future as a result Tim Cook in his role as CEO of Apple once told an NCP PR representative that when we work on making our devices accessible by the blind I don't consider the bloody ROI if you want me to do things only for ROI reasons you should get out of the stock who when pressured by the FBI to break iOS security absent directly applicable laws held his and Apple's ground and told them to legislate or desist while we believe the FBI is intentions are good it would be wrong for the government to force us to build a backdoor into our products and ultimately we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and Liberty our government is meant to protect who stood in front of the world and said privacy was a human right technology's potential is and always must be rooted in a faith people having it in the optimism and creativity that it stirs in the hearts of individuals in its promise and capacity to make the world a better place it's time to face facts we will never achieve technology's true potential without the full faith and confidence of the people who use it and famously when I arrived in my office each morning I'm greeted by framed photos of dr. King and Robert F Kennedy I don't pretend that writing this puts me in their league all it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that I'm doing my part however small to help others we pave the sunlit path towards justice together brick by brick this is my brick how then to square this Tim Cook and that Apple with the one that takes down VPN apps in China remove taijuan flag emoji sits on the counsel of a US president with whom he disagrees on social and civil issues and follows laws in other countries that are seen from the outside to be deleterious even corrosive to civil liberties and the truth some even some who strongly support Apple in every other way see it as disappointing hypocritical manipulative even cowardly cook himself though sees it as part of a consistent policy of engagement from 2017 each country in the world decides their laws and their regulations and so your choices do you participate or do you stand on the sidelines and yell at how things should be you get in the arena because nothing ever changes from the sidelines and now in 2019 I don't believe in having people talk on my behalf I don't believe in lobbyists I believe in direct conversation I strongly believe in engagement I hate polarization I despise it Tim Cook's Apple seems to believe that following local laws and staying in markets like China and Russia as distasteful and unpalatable as those laws can be lets them expand apple's market share support their local customer bases and stay engaged with the governments to rollback restrictions and push forward their own agendas basically a modern version of carpet bombing with blue jeans and beetles tapes that they can stay involved with the Trump administration to reduce or prevent tariffs protect immigration and press for environmental reforms critics would argue that engagement can become indistinguishable from appeasement and confused with support that they have not shown the ability to resist extra legal requests even petty ones outside the US the way they did inside the US with data that Tim Cook's Apple has set themselves up as not just another tech giant but as a moral and ethical leader that people expect them to act not just as a company that prioritizes cold impersonal profit but a group of people deeply committed to making the world a better place as well who buy Apple as much for their positions on privacy and human rights as they do their build quality or user experience Wall Street seems to love how Tim Cook and Apple are navigating these political firestorms the stock price has never been higher if Apple had chosen to violate Chinese or Russian or it overtly resisted their pressure much as if they chosen to violate US law and either had to face the consequences or withdraw from their regions and face the full weight of the tariffs the stock price might be something else entirely right now nevermind the legal action from shareholders abandoned customers and the need to find entirely new manufacturing and assembly bases Apple by virtue of their business model never had to face the moral and ethical dilemmas that comes with deeply exploiting user data like Google and Facebook half or of massive cloud companies providing services to government agencies many people find problematic if not abhorrent to the ideals of liberty and justice like Google Amazon and Microsoft have but by virtue of selling products and being ever expected to sell more products Apple now has to face the moral and ethical dilemma of being entrenched in meshed entangled in selling those products and supporting their customers in places where the laws and expectations differ radically from those in the US and Apple will also soon have to face not so seemingly black and white good and evil dilemmas as more and more Western countries consider and enact data a patreon and anti encryption laws as well for me personally I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't deeply conflicted about all of this I'm someone who does in part by Apple products not just because of what they are but because of what Apple stands for I want Apple fighting absolutely I just don't want them to lose what it is they're fighting for and this current strategy risks a lot of short-term damage to their reputation but also to their ability to lead for what mostly seems like long term hope as invaluable as hope is Tim Cook like very very few CEOs of his stature or influence seems to have an utterly amazing ability to suppress his own ego in situations where he thinks he can benefit Apple or the social interest he holds dear it's a remarkable trait but it can also be damaging to him personally sure the internet is easy Apple is right to obey local laws or Apple needs to stand up for what's right anyone can type and send those Hawtree axes in a hot second without knowing or carrying much of anything about the consequences of obeying the laws or refusing to speaking truth to politics or standing silently nearby or understanding multiple things can be true in different contexts but that doesn't mean it still isn't important to share your views on the contrary apples calculus and all this includes our reactions all of them so let them know frequently loudly and let me know as well hit like if you do hate if you don't subscribe if you haven't already ring the bell
