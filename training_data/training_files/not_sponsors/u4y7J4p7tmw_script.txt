I bet that there's something you didn't know about Call of Duty war zone in this video today we're going to be taking a look at damage and wall penetration and I was inspired to make this because of comments left on a video that I recently uploaded about a very high damaged m4 built using these so combats and I saw a lot of comments from people saying why didn't you put the FMJ perk on this as it adds more damage this is a common misconception however with the FMJ perk but when you load gunsmith and look at how the stats on the weapon change you can understand where it comes from as you can see on an m4 here when we add FMJ the damage bar goes up so naturally people assume that it increases the damage according to the description and the pros and cons though it says that the only thing this does is increase bullet penetration and damage against equipment and killstreaks so there is a bit of a contradiction there and no clear answer and so a lot of people still believe that it adds more base damage to your weapon and some people even think that armor in warzone is classed as equipment and by that thinking having FMJ will do more damage so now we're going to test this and prove what is really going on here and hopefully I'll show you I think having FMJ on your gun is a waste of an attachment slot and it's too situational to be useful in the majority of fights that you get into on warzone my method then was to make four different loadouts using two of the most popular guns in warzone the m4 and the HDR so on the m4 I have one with FMJ often one with it on and same goes for HDR as well one with FMJ off and one with it on nice and simple and next I enlisted the help of my friend Andrew and we queued up for ages and got into matches as enemies together and began experimenting some of the results and things we discovered were quite surprising and enlightening too so let's take a look right so the first thing we're gonna test is the m4 with FMJ off so I'm gonna damage my friend Andrew here break his armor and I wonder if you put three plates in one two three I'm just going to prove that I've got that loadout FMJ off you can see there I'm going to see how many bullets it takes knock him down to the chest here we go one two three four five six seven eight nine nine bullets of the m4 so if you self revive Andrew so now we're gonna test with FMJ on and just to prove I've got that loader FMJ on there it is I've got all five folks on there and I'm going to shoot under again in the chest is full health full armor and we're going to see how many shots it takes one two three four five six seven eight nine exactly the same okay so now we've got the HDR with FMJ off so we're going to see full health full armor plates on Andrew to the chest one shot two shots three shots okay so now we're using HDR FMJ on how many shots to the chest one two three sadly the same so now what we're going to test is headshot damage with FMJ off as andrew full health full armor let's see how many shots it takes to put him down 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 shots okay so now we've got FMJ on and we're going to go a head shot damage again let's see 1 2 3 4 5 6 exactly the same okay now headshot damage on the HDR FMJ off one shot one kill okay now is HDRI femme Jeon and no prizes if you can guess what's gonna happen there we go instantly dead okay so now we're going to test FMJ damage through something like brick Andrews stood in the corner there and as you can see we've got FMJ offload out equipped I'm gonna go a single fire let's test this no penetration nothing and he's right there that bullet should be hearing him okay round two here's Andrew again same war loadout FM J's on m4 what do you reckon guys is this gonna go through yes it does that's quite interesting because in this scenario this m4 with FMJ off would not hit Andrew at all they'd be absolutely zero damage through that wall if he was there but with FMJ on through a brick wall maybe it's worth it so that goes from not being able to kill him to being able to kill him quite an advantage there but very situational okay so now we're gonna test FMJ damage through trees so under if you just come stand right behind this tree here that's it perfect now on this m4 loadout I've got FMJ turned off so let's see what happens and he's right there I'm gonna fire a bullet nothing that is not penetrating that tree with FMJ off so now Andrews in exactly the same spot this time I've got my info with FMJ on can we penetrate this tree nothing so regardless of if you've got FMJ on or off on an assault rifle like the m4 here it will not penetrate this type of tree doesn't matter so unders they're next to the tree again I've got the HDR this HDR FMJ is off can we do it let's see nothing no penetration even through the corners just not hearing him how about with it from jail on ok there's Andrew again HDR FMJ is on let's see if it goes through yes it does but you can actually shoot through these trees if you're using a high-power rifle like the HDR and you've got fnj turned on so that might be a good use for it it's not something that I would put on my gun not often to be honest as you can see it's not really doing that much damage and that's a head shot right there finally broke the armor but it does actually go through that with it from jail on so there's full health full armor Andrew I'm gonna say how many head shots it takes to kill him through the tree with FMJ lon HDR is 1s2 there's three so with FMJ on you could actually three hit kill someone through a tree if you hit them in the head every single time and they were full HP and full armor really the damage through something as big as a tree it's so small I just don't think it's worth taking over another attachment okay so Andrews here full health full armor and what we're gonna do is close the door I'm going to aim at the chest and as you can see at the moment I'm using FMJ off and we're going to see how many shots it takes through the door here we go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 okay there's Andrew again full health full armor and a Crouch get in the position close the door this build is FMJ on on the m4 how many shots through the door one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one less with FMJ turned on through a wooden door doesn't seem to be worth it there does it now one thing that we've discovered in our testing is that not all trees are created equal so the one that we tested on earlier was a very different type of tree to this Bernard argue that these are more common in the game and what we've discovered is that if there's an enemy behind this type of tree and this gun here is FMJ off right now as you can see Andrews there I'm gonna shoot him nothing no penetration whatsoever absolute zero okay round to same tree same Andrew this time m4 is what FMJ turned on what's this hit Marcus so again that's an advantage for FMJ this type of tree as well as this type of brick surface you can actually shoot people through them with FMJ turned on if you don't have FMJ on this wouldn't be possible as you can see though damage isn't that high but still it is an option that you would have with FMJ turned on so you had to hit him quite a few times there to actually down him so it doesn't know if the damage significantly but at least it's possible right so I'm going to show you guys this is well because I know that you're gonna ask about it same tree HDR what's this gonna look like so there's Andrew again and we're just going to test headshot damage here and this is the HDR with FMJ turned off so Andrews there how many shots through the tree one two three four five so HDR up through the tree five shots with it on I think it's gonna be quite different let's find out okay this time same tree full health full armor FMJ is on how many bullets do you reckon guys one to significantly different isn't it when you go fnj turned on through a tree kills a lot quicker right what about through the center of the tree is it any different than shooting at the corner let's find out one two three so depending on where you shoot through the tree it does actually make a difference it seems corner shops tend to do a bit more damage because it appears that there's just less wood to travel through if you're shooting all the way through the tree it's going to take a few more bullets to kill and once again through the corner of the tree with headshots just to show that it is actually more damage to a corner breaks the arm straight away second shot has to kill so the thickness of the object has to be taken into account one thing that I wanted to test as well was range just range have an impact on this so hundreds at that tree there's about fifty meters away I think that's maybe the average distance you would want to engage someone with an assault rifle and on this one I've got FMJ turned off so we're gonna test this again I'm gonna try and go for a chest shot so we'll go single shot and let's count how many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 shots they're at 50 meters okay again same position this time a home jet is on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 well same number bullets so then based on the testing that we've just done what have we learnt here and what are the conclusions well I think we can break it down into four number one FMJ does not improve your base weapon damage if you're shooting into a target you've got direct line of sight on and let's be honest that's the majority of the time it doesn't do any more damage to armor and it does not make a difference at all for body shots or head shots either and range doesn't appear to come into the equation - number 2 FMJ does increase bullet damage only when shooting through surfaces at targets number 3 on certain weapons and with certain guns FMJ allows you to shoot through surfaces which otherwise could not be penetrated without it and number 4 bullet damage through surfaces in general appears to take thickness into account typically the thick of the object the less damage output on the other side wrapping up based on that knowledge my opinion is that FMJ is not a perk worth equipping on your guns I think the amount of times that you would actually shoot at a target through an object per match is quite low the damage drop-off is harsh - especially with assault rifles and I would much rather substitute it for another attachment on my gun instead that for example improved recoil control or aim down the sights speed one other observation is I think that the in gunsmith could be a bit more accurate and perhaps offer a better explanation or description as to what some of the perks and attachments do don't believe the box and that's all do let me know you didn't dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one
