hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with chicken and broccoli curry that's right through our handful of basic fundamental recipes that anyone that really wants to learn how to cook has to master and that's because the same basic techniques gonna work no matter what meats and vegetables and spices use and it's learning to make dishes like this that allows to go from someone that knows how to follow a recipe to someone that actually creates recipes which is not only way more enjoyable it also pays a lot better so with that let's go ahead and get started by mixing up our curry spice blend and this time we'll be going with some ground cumin some ground coriander some paprika and can use either regular or smoked okay dealer's choice we will also toss in some tumeric as well as some freshly ground black pepper and then of course some salt and then we will finish up with our good old friend cayenne pepper and that's it we'll go ahead and take a spoon and give this a mix and depending on exactly what we're gonna include in our curry we may want to include some other or different spices here but generally we are going to want to start this process by mixing up some sort of dry spice blend and then what we'll do once that is mixed up is go ahead and apply about half of it to whatever meat we're gonna use in our curry which for me this time is gonna be a couple large boneless skinless chicken breasts and we'll take about 50% of our mixture and apply it very generously to both sides and yes of course if want to use boneless skinless chicken thighs could use those instead and there's basically two approaches to this step okay we could if we want to cut our meat into smaller pieces and then toss it with these spices which is probably what I would do if I was using thighs but since we're using breasts here I prefer this approach where we coat the whole thing and then what we'll do is sear this and partially cook it and then cut up the meat and that way I think we have much less chance of this drying out and then time permitting once these spices have been applied I like to wrap this up and pop in the fridge for a few hours to give that me plenty of time to absorb all those flavors but having said that if do want this a little quicker could skip this step and just start cooking it right that's up to I mean are after all the ann-marie of making curry in a hurry but personally I do like to let mine sit in the fridge for at least a few hours and while we're waiting for that we might as well go ahead and prep our broccoli which I like to start by cutting the florets off the stems for the very simple reason that those cook a lot faster so by separating them at this point we'll be able to add those at different times during the cooking process and hopefully end up with a much more consistent final product and what we'll do for they much more fibrous tougher stem parts is go ahead and slice those lengthwise into some kind of semi uniform strips at which point we can then turn those and then slice them across like this and to whatever size pieces want and as usual the exact size of these pieces really doesn't matter as long as they're fairly consistent so pick a size and stick with it and then as far as the tops go I like to cut down straight through the piece of stem that's holding that head together so we can divide those into a little more bite-sized pieces so I went ahead and did that to about a pound of broccoli total and then transfer that into two bowls and then assume in our chicken is sat spiced in the fridge long enough we'll go ahead and pull that out and cook it in some butter set over medium-high heat but not all the way okay we're only gonna do this for about three minutes per side just so it cooks about halfway through since once we have this cut up we are going to toss this back in our curry to finish cooking okay so we're basically just searing on some of the spices and firming up these breasts a little bit so we can get a nice clean cut not to mention starting to develop the flavors in this pan so once those are set we'll turn off the heat and we'll transfer those onto a plate and we'll let those sit until they're cool enough to handle and then while those are resting we will head back to the stove to build our curry sauce which we'll start by turning our heat back on to medium-high and we will sizzle some crushed garlic in that hot butter for about 30 seconds or so before stirring in the rest of our curry spice mix and we'll toast all that not how butter for another 30 seconds or so which is really gonna help bring out a lot of flavor okay this is one of the secrets to making a decent curry we always want to briefly toast those in the pan before adding our liquids so that's what we'll do before heading in one can of coconut milk all right the full fat kind do not use the low-fat coconut milk we're going to need that fat I'm also believe it or not going to toss in a little bit of ketchup or as we call it in the world of curries tomato chutney go ahead and stir all that together making sure we're rubbing all that delicious goodness off the bottom and we will wait for this to come up to a simmer and once it does I like to turn it down to medium and let it cook for about 10 minutes and then just so it doesn't reduce down too far I also decided to throw in a splash of chicken broth or if times are tough could just use a splash of water and we'll stir that in and like I said we'll let that simmer for about 10 minutes after which if everything's gone according to plan it should look something like this and then what we'll do wants our curry sauce is set let's go ahead and toss in our broccoli stems and we'll give those a stir and we will cook them until they're almost but not quite tender which I would love to tell how long that's gonna take but I can't because I don't know how big he cut those but you'll know because after about five minutes go ahead and test them and what we can do while those are cooking if you're in the multitasking is go ahead and cube up our partially cooked chicken breast which I'm going to do by cutting into about half inch strips and then turning and cutting it into about half inch cubes and because these were partially cooked this is only gonna need a few minutes in that hot sauce to finish cooking perfectly so we'll go ahead and cut up that chicken as shown and then we'll head back to the stove and assuming our broccoli stems are just about tender we'll go ahead and add the tops and we'll sort of poke those down a little bit until they're evenly distributed at which point we'll cover this and we'll let that cook for about three or four minutes until those are almost tender and again I can't give x or gotta check yourself before wreck yourself and by self I mean broccoli and once determine that is almost tender we will go ahead and stir in our chicken and let it cook for maybe two or three more minutes or until that chicken is just cooked through oh and I should mention if are using thighs here probably want to add those to the pan when add the broccoli stems since those will take a little bit longer to cook than this breast meat and that's it once everything's cooked to our liking we are pretty much down to just checking this for seasoning and if necessary maybe stirring in a little more salt oh and by the way if want bright green still firm broccoli in this feel free it will definitely look better but in my opinion it will not taste better okay I don't want a mushy and fallin apart but I do want my broccoli cooked very very tender which I believe is going to give better less bitter sweeter flavor but of course suit yourself and that's it once we've tasted and ingested the seasonings we'll go ahead and serve that up on some rice with of course plenty of that amazing flavorful sauce and I went ahead and finish up with some freshly sliced green onions oh and besides the fact that can do this with all kinds of different meat and vegetables and spices can also instead of putting this on rice use it on noodles or french fries for like a curry version of poutine oh yeah I think anne-marie would have liked that and that's it one of my all-time favorite curries was done and ready to enjoy and because coconut milk has that rich subtly sweet flavor it just works so well with those big bold aromatic spices we used and as I touched on earlier while this would work with any combination of meat and vegetables chicken and broccoli is a wonderful combination and one of my favorite pairings for a simple curry like this and I know the food stylists aren't happy but I make no apologies for fully cooking this broccoli okay for me a dish like this is classic comfort food and when I think comfort food I do not think about biting into still crunchy broccoli but again that's just personal preference and if want could just add that broccoli with the chicken and just cook it for a couple of minutes at the end but anyway that's it how to make a very simple coconut milk-based curry with a few minor tweaks this exact same technique will work with any kind of meat and vegetables and the more make this trying different things it becomes less a recipe and more just something delicious make to eat which is not the only reason but it is the main reason I really do hope give this a try soon so please follow the links below for the ingredient amounts a principle written recipe a much more info as usual and as always enjoy
