so it's no secret that everyone in the world is going through a tough time right now and I think we could all use something that's gonna put a smile on our face now for my many years of watching twitch livestreams I know there's one thing that never fails to put a smile on someone's face and that is running into a cute noob in runescape so today I'm gonna be dressing up in some noob gear and giving it a very weird name and I'm gonna walk it past some streamers and see if we can get a few loves so that's the plan I'm gonna dress up in some really weird gear and go to really random places doing really weird things and hopefully put a smile on some people's faces now unfortunately I can't do it with this account because well I'm maxed people aren't gonna walk past a max account at 126 combat and go damn that guy looks like a [ __ ] noob luckily enough for us I have plenty of accounts through all my years of playing and this one is 78 combat it is a Zurcher account so if they do look at the stats they'll probably say oh this guy's not a [ __ ] noob it's a bazooka pure but people don't really look at the stats just as your walk and pass so that's the plan we're gonna use this account unfortunately the name is dieter titter so we're gonna have to change that up and the name we're gonna go with today is 4/20 bongs 69 yeah that's the name we're going with and there it is you're gonna walk past a man called 4/20 bongs 69 you're gonna stop guys pardon so make sure you get in quick good luck and I'll see you there Barney boys we're on we're looking like an absolute [ __
