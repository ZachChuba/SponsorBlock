everything is very clearly marked and it's already messing off okay so a little bit of weird slowing down here I'm not sure why I only got some debris in the road here and it's just still breaking I don't know it's it's got to be the cones that's all I can guess what is going on everybody welcome back to a Tesla challenge this is number 21 and really weird interaction with this white pickup in front of me I saved it on the dashcam I don't know if you can see from the footage but he was like flicking me off and doing this and stuff so that was really strange I don't think he likes Tesla but anyway we are here to test out auto pilots new ability of stopping at stop signs traffic lights all that kind of stuff so normally during a Tesla challenge I'm on the highway going on ramp to off-ramp testing if autopilot can do what Tesla advertises and make all the lane changes take exits and do everything without me interacting now safety is number one so I have a hand on the wheel like Tesla says you need to do I'm paying attention if I have to take over I will if you're not familiar with this ability I'll put a link in the top right check out that video it'll tell you about how this works and everything so I have a couple good spots to test this we're starting on Woodward which is a nice big road very everything is very clearly marked and it's already messing up but everything's very clearly marked nice open road it's divided so I can set the speed to whatever I want I can go over the speed limit so I'm gonna try to take Woodward all the way down to I'm going to 14 mile I don't know exactly how many miles it is but I'm gonna let the car do everything here I guess we can start right now I will try not to cut any more so we're already stopping for something that's not there the other thing I'll try to hit the stock for you to confirm everything whenever it comes up to a green light or if a red light turns green I need to hit the stalk or hit the pedal to tell the car it's okay to go I have found for me it's a little easier to hit the accelerator but I'll try to do this so you can see what I'm you guys so much Stephanie I really appreciate the support so green light I'm just gonna hit that so let's let the car do its thing let's see how it can do if you can get me all the way to my destination without me having to take over now one more thing I will in the car in this circumstance cannot do lane changes so I may change lanes if I need to but if I don't need to I'm not going to I don't know why it keeps like it sees another let me put this up for you nobody's behind me so it's all another it seemed like traffic lights and there's nothing that it should be seeing so anyway I'll stop rambling let's let the car do its thing and check it out see how it does I accidentally hit the accelerator I'm just so used to actually hitting the accelerator instead of using the stock my main worry for this I think the cars gonna do fine it does seem to get confused already a little bit but my main worry is the acceleration like the take-off from a stop is pretty slow so I just you know I don't want to annoy anybody around me and another kind of random braking they're seeing all the cones everywhere that's nice even these weird little mini cones but it's doing okay so far just yeah I don't know like why was it slowing there that was that was strange so here you know the cars were slowing and my car slowing and I tell it to go and it almost continued slowing before it started to accelerate again it's it's fine it's not that big of a deal but it's just I don't want anyone behind me to get confused with that kind of weird non natural stuff and then again it says traffic control it didn't actually seem to slow there but that's fine and you know that's another reason I'm kind of staying in the left lane not that this is a highway or anything but I'm out of the way if people want to be passing me I may move over to the right lane if I get too many people turning left and slowing me down but we'll see also at the end I forgot to say it's been a while since I've done a challenge will great auto pilot performance so I used to grade it but I don't want to influence you guys so you grade how you think auto pilot did in the top right there will be a little card top right of the video actually think I'm supposed to point that way but it's up right to the video and you can pick you know ABCD tell me how you think auto pilot did so you can see just a lot of traffic lights here over and over again and hitting the stock every time is working really well I've had it before where it would get confused if you hit it too early it would start to slow down again for the same traffic light and that hasn't happened yet on this try we are in the latest software 20 2012 dot 11.1 so I haven't noticed any improvements specifically but maybe that's one of them already so that was pretty quick actually coming up to our turnaround here after this light so this is going to be part two here so that was pretty easy the card did pretty well besides getting confused it I that was very strange to me I don't know why it was confused thinking so I've completely taken over thinking there was stoplights there and you know normally you can say like oh that looked like a stoplight or or it saw stop playing another lane or something but I didn't see anything that should be getting confused with so taking over here and this second part is going to be pretty wicked this road is all under construction there's cones everywhere there's weird lanes and stuff yes you can turn left unread in that situation just so you know so this roads gonna be kind of crazy and we're really gonna push it here so I was pretty excited for this okay so here we go starting off whenever I can turn it on now in this road it's probably not gonna let me go over the speed limit well it is for now but it'll probably take that ability away unless before construction this was divided then maybe it won't but this is a good speed so you can see a lot of construction going on okay so a little bit of weird slowing down here I'm not sure why I do have people behind me so I'm not going to let that happen too much I may have to use accelerator let me see yeah so now it won't let me go up the speed limit that's what I we're going to slow the link for that is in the description I don't know why it's slowing down it's still slowing down I guess because of the cones I mean they're clearly outside of the lane here and then it popped up that signal but my foot was on the accelerator so that's very strange maybe the cones are too close to the car it's not comfortable with that okay so I'm gonna take over here because these people are all turning left yep it's okay I know very confusing for you so this is weird this like oh my gosh I was confused by that that black that black light really confused me and then it turned yellow and by the time I realized what was going on it was too late so car is really hard braking for that it wanted to stop for the yellow light which is fair it's not appropriate because it's the blinking yellow you're supposed to go through but well I guess the car would have stopped anyway but so what I'm saying is I hit the stock and it tried to slow again even though I told it to go so I had to tell it one more time to go through I've heard that with blinking yellow as it gets confused we're kind of every time it blinks it pops up the system resets and you have to hit the stock again and I was just experiencing that there so luckily no one's behind us I can let it do its really slow acceleration only got some debris in the road here the car does actually it was braking but I'm not I'm not watching this so I don't know why I was breaking but I had already told you to go through the light and it's just still breaking I don't know it's it's got to be the cones that's all I can guess but why is it okay going 30 but not 40 you know it's just strange maybe the car just thinks it's safer to go 30 with all the construction everywhere I'm really not sure Wow lots of cones everywhere the screen is picking up a good amount of them pretty impressive alright so I think that's all for the construction let's hit another intersection or two and then you know leave your grade up in the top right let me know what you think I look forward to talking you down in the comments about this one that was okay I mean obviously there's a lot to go we're still paying a lot of attention here I mean compared to like any other car it's like the best thing available to any of us so it's good it's very cool I'm excited for the next few months as we get updates and this gets better and better but it's still really good stuff already well that's it for this one pretty good job there Tesla let me know what you think down in the comments and you will see my car in the next video
