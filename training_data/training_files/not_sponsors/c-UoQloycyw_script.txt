[Music] last week I went on to the old school runescape homepage and started thinking about the number of people playing that's what I realized there's two types of players within this cluster of people online the ones who are enjoying their time and having fun with whatever grind they're taking on and then the ones who have fallen too deep into the depths of runescape praying that their internet somehow goes out so they can finally be free of this game that they hate so much yet cannot bring themselves to log off so then I jumbled a bunch of unorganized thoughts onto a Word document turned on my camera and attempted to address two things one how can I explain to a normal functional human being that this many people play runescape in 2022 how can I help those miserable people who don't want to be playing feel less miserable when they log in this is what I came up with so good luck hey do I look good guys I look good over there he said I look good so I think I'll start talking now what's hey this is a very sporadic video I was recording procrastinating by release I had this idea in my head so I you know decided to film myself let's talk about this the title the title is up wait no title is down there now this is an observation and it might help people and maybe it'll be a guide by the end I don't know let's just see what happens [Music] before I made by release I could not stand this game because I've played this game since 2006 I was ready to move on and do literally anything else play anything else but as you may already know that's not really possible with runescape because if you didn't quit this game before you entered high school you're still here what's going on there's a very famous saying there's no such thing as quitting runescape only taking breaks those breaks range anywhere from from two hours to 11 years take my buddy 9 rain for example he quit the game after the wilderness was removed did not come back until 2018 and oh look at that oh t doin what's what's that guy up to oh he's making read skate video oh yeah hope you had a nice break 9a and welcome back it's just how it works I don't make the rules but we know we were forced to follow them it's incredibly difficult to explain this to anybody who has either never played runescape or somehow quit when they were younger I recently became pals with general Sam he didn't quite understand why I'm playing runescape in 2020 hey can I tell you something that's gonna piss you off yeah I've never played runescape top once ever ever I've never even loaded they came up really yeah your entire craft is a sham in my eyes all of these other games they invite you to partake in their narrative in their storyline which are three for example hundreds of hours of exploring a ton of side missions for you to discover another good one Skyrim huge exploration factor you can pick a class to build your character around melee mage range Assassin's Creed Odyssey one of the best games I've ever played all the different scenarios you can find yourself in shape about one of nine possible endings I'm getting a phone call not allowed we're busy we're talking about video games it's more important so with that in mind here's the difference between those games and runescape those other games stories the devs are aware of every possible scenario you can end up with you are partaking in their story the runescape story that's the runescape story those numbers are the meat the juiciness your narrative your plot twists it's all right there runescape is not something you just go into delving into the storylines even being around for almost twenty years now the large majority of players probably have no idea about half the lore in this game I didn't until I started by release because this whole world it's not meant for you to experience this world is built to experience you I know I'm so [ __ ] inspiring dude that's awesome get goosebumps yeah your [ __ ] you did it is the only world that actually lets us become immersed in other games you can put 300 hours of gameplay in get a hundred percent completion you don't just complete runescape it's kind of impossible the reason I that is yes you can max out every skill I'm not talking just 99s I'm talking 200 mil XP and each skill which takes [ __ ] I don't understand that that I can't explain that to other people I I'm sorry but even if you did do that that's not necessarily their definition of being completed they move on to the next goal let's look at this maniac for example well over a million people tuned in to see this guy's 7000 our story once he completed that story he was not completed clearly he took it to the next level he was like I'm just gonna stay in this part of the world now and this part really [ __ ] sucks so you might want to tune into this which inspired a lot of other people to pick up a pen and start writing I think that's about as as best as I can explain this giant black hole we've all been sucked into and can never escape so here's why we find ourselves forcing enjoyment while playing this game in most scenarios people set a goal for themselves account builds maxing stats obtaining endgame items it makes you work for that [ __ ] long tedious disgusting grinds you will find yourself doing things over and over and over again you go to sleep and you dream of runescape grinds scared out of your mind when you wake up realizing you didn't do any of that lost in an existential crisis hoping to god you can somehow escape but you can't because you need that item or you need that 99 you've been dreaming of it for so long as a child and if you haven't felt that way yet you will you totally will you definitely will so here's some advice from the master of XP waste and advocate of of inefficiency on how to enjoy runescape I guess perhaps chances are you have a main account that account has no restrictions train anything you want however you want make money however you want you can get that quest Cape max that skill you can do whatever you damn please but good god that [ __ ] can get boring so a long time ago two different account builds were created we got the piers and the skillers at first piers were just I'm not trained in defense I'm gonna hit some fatty numbers on some [ __ ] in the wilderness that are really low combat and I'm gonna be the same combat as them and they're gonna ask what the [ __ ] just happened and then pure started evolving Pure's had somewhat of a restriction because you couldn't attack things with the defensive style selected which I would know nothing about if I made a pure would never touch the defensive attack style ID is like the last thing I would ever do skiller's no combat pacifist baby the guys who wouldn't hurt a fly but they would call you some pretty mean names given the chance seeing a level 3 with a 99 was incredible it's a very dignity crushing feeling they couldn't walk in certain areas of the game because you would get dropped by like a level 14 monster it's [ __ ] embarrassing so those two account types were the first class of a restricted account you know add a little salt and pepper of their gameplay and restrictions is the key term here I'm not sure who it was that started it but Bodie kind of made this concept popular with his one-man army series of not trading players or using the grant exchange playing runescape as if it was single-player I've got to do this it's not a such a grind Jagex actually officially implemented code into the game that allowed for people to become iron men accounts which was exactly that we've got the hardcore Ironman if you die at all on this account you lose your status as hardcore that account type is actually way more bizarre on runescape 3 if you die on your hardcore Ironman it logs you out and you cannot log back in that [ __ ] is extreme I'm not entirely sure when they were getting posted but there was a guy on reddit who was posting little snippets he was not only playing as if it was single-player in this one man army Ironman mode but he also wasn't using the bank so he was limited to only the items he had in his inventory and his equipment slots I remember seeing dropping all of his stuff to get on to the the Munk Island meet the [ __ ] boss there get back and pick up his items in time and he did it and it was insane that was a cool thing to see for the first time and that led to ultimate Ironman and now it's a super popular story to read so regarding to enjoying runescape this is kind of the whole point give yourself a challenge that you were kind of hesitant to try obviously being a person that wasn't too into the whole grinding thing by release has been a crazy-ass challenge but it turned out to be really fun and there's been some times with that account where I procrastinate recording because I'm busy grinding and I'm actually enjoying grinding which I've never experienced before until by release with the PvP videos I put out I've created three different pure accounts now and I learned how to PK and if I can learn how to do it you sure can because I suck at this game have a really fat KD by the way I'm good depending on who you ask this game is built around grinding obviously and there's a lot of plugins and different things in the game that can keep you on track and inform you of how you're doing with that grind turn that [ __ ] off man you ever sit in a classroom and you're just looking at the clock that's on the wall just waiting for it to tick down slowly so you can get the hell out of there go home probably play this [ __ ] game that's what those globe [ __ ] things are those glowing circular orbs manuals are [ __ ] clocks in a classroom if it's like an aesthetically pleasing thing for you go ahead keep on it if you think about grinding anyway like I do that is that is my worst nightmare they serve no purpose towards your grind other than just a constant reminder of how slow things are going there's also a secret technique not many people know about if you go into your settings you can actually turn the XP until thing off when you when you hover over one of the skills back in the day the XP until was not a thing you had to do math [ __ ] math that was like the first clock that they put in the game is you would just hover your mouse over after every other action you were doing just to like see it go down slowly just slowly watching it watching it go down real slow it's like a brain-dead [ __ ] just staring at that thing hovering your mouse over turn it off dude it makes things go by so much faster I swear by it I think probably the biggest thing I've learned in my time not only on runescape but YouTube especially stop being afraid to XP ways you're playing a video game man you can still accomplish things and have fun here and there you know that right I made that comparison in the construction video of how we've turned playgrounds into offices that's not literal [ __ ] take off your suit and tie go do what I did the other day and start role-playing in houses what do you think you're doing the [ __ ] is simply dicks the question we all know we've all been wondering my gun what simple ethics please don't have some fun man I have like this whole event committee god bless them they just organize events for people sometimes they have to do with skilling but most of the time it's like a minigame or something you normally would never do if you were by yourself another thing teach yourself how to make videos with your account that adds a whole lot of spice I would use runescape as nothing more than a medium to make machinima skits on I would never skill do anything remotely productive on the game I would wander around looking for the next thing to make fun of you can totally do that dude you're not obligated to do anything you're not employed by runescape I mean I kind of I'm kind of employed by runescape technically as of now I don't want to be I would love to not be employed by runescape watch my [ __ ] tarkov video try a bi release account if you want to just don't make a video that's funnier than mine this video has been all over the place I don't even know if I've answered the question I really don't we'll all be fine we'll all get through this together this eternity long black hole that we are forever in for as long as we're breathing but yeah I think that's all I have I mostly just wanted to point out about how [ __ ] up it is that we can't get out of this scary scary place all on your first website or domain hey check it out you'll regret it if you don't alright bye
