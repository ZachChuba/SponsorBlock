don't calm /live okay sweet that's not what I'm on so theoretically I click done here and we are going to be streaming live to you a wonderful ladies and gentlemen tuning into the land show ray I have no idea this is working so guys we've got a great show for you today we're gonna be talking about the is it working there's an ad well YouTube is working exactly as intended good job YouTube yeah wonderful so we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today naturally reaction to the Tesla truck I don't think Luke and I are gonna agree on this one so uh yeah that'll be interesting look you're wrong before and whatever it is you think you you must be wrong our opinions man no you can have a wrong game you can have a wrong opinion you know what we can talk about that more later we are also going to talk about some of the changes to YouTube over the last little bit either I haven't been on the show right when it's happened or I just got distracted and did other things but I've had quite a few people asking me hey yo line is usually you weigh in on this stuff where's your take on Coppa ruling and you know where's your take on the whole thing where YouTube can just like you know shut down your channel if they deem it to be not financially viable what else we got I mean AMD confirming xand three details google stadia thoughts which was gonna be after stream but apparently isn't anymore yeah that's a bit of a lie now we were gonna do a stream earlier today trying it and then we were like yeah so that's kind of got the thoughts well I haven't tried it so I I was actually kind of thinking maybe people get people who have actually tried it to come on with us about it yeah yeah cool but we can still talk about things like the business model and all that and oh that's not true forget it forget it are we gonna talk about the thing wait a minute what's going on here there's only 85 people watching that alone oh no chats like going crazy yeah there's no way that's 85 people yes why is your software so bad why is it so bad okay hold on a second guys I just gotta I just gotta like show you guys what's going on here because it's just okay so YouTube has a new creator swirl roll the intro NAB it okay so this computer screen or whatever we can help you there's nothing incriminating on here so oh crap oh crap oh balls well okay one second everyone what's happening what do you do just chill okay oh no that's bad that's bad that's bad right why that's fine that's standard oh I thought that was the other no no it's not that again it's not that it's all good yeah okay I don't even know I don't know why they would have that there anyway it doesn't matter okay look so here what are we what are we looking at here what why is this oh because the OBS is in the display capture so so it's gonna look whatever key look at this terrible look at this terrible thing here okay so when you make an event you've got here is this the old live dashboard yeah see this makes sense here's the old live dashboard hey you're live here's how long you've been live here's how many people are watching here's some chats here's some super extra boosted chats here's some stuff you said about your stream and like here's how things are going and in general you know this all makes sense now let's go to the new creator studio new creator studio okay so the preview is not working the concurrent viewers are obviously not working likes are not working new messages apparently there are zero and I think chat probably has a word or two to say about that I don't know if everything's about the likes is you actually do have exactly seven dislikes but no and then it changed right when I said it yeah chat Rev I don't know I don't even know what chat read is short for mousing over normally on a sensible web page would tell me what's under this ellipses here no no okay and then we've got some stream settings here sigh oh yeah thank goodness the 360 degree video button is front and center instead of you know how many people are watching the damn show yeah so we've got some inaccurate analytics I think YouTube is rolling this thing out they are actually rolling this thing out to people in such a way that you cannot opt out that's happening in like a matter of weeks oh god that's how broken it is it's unbelievable how broken it is I love that I love that no data yeah it's great what even is that I'm not supposed to be I don't know we're gonna go back to this for a second what is no why's there no data what data should be that we don't have we have no idea what are we missing out on the next streaming software to start preview what does that even mean nothing nothing we did this this is done we clicked done and it's not there oh wait old dashboard working just fine huh how about that bit it's bizarre I don't get it I don't get it not are aware clearly this is my fault I I'm at I'm at fault here let's roll the intro that is kind of unbelievable I tried to use the new dashboard multiple times since they've been trying to push it onto people and I've never once had a guy's pay well I've just the reason I used it is because I've been trying to get rid of that issue wear it for that in the documents on there already broadcast a week before it's actually been broadcast so here ya know what let's let's go ahead let's show you guys that too so if we go on youtube.com slash - tech tips because I'm og like that suckas got that non /c lame-o URL so let's go into our videos here so this is wonderful it's wonderful look at all these look at all these whoa Wow we need to scroll down from that yeah this is all safe well this shows videos that are not live Oh so don't worry about desktop captures like never a good anyway the point is check this out even more rise in leaks from six days ago ah No ok that was six days ago so where's that worst a stupid one uh China restricts play time right a week ago that's not right why does why does that say a week ago why does this say a week ago that doesn't make any sense that wasn't a week ago that was two weeks ago that was November the 8th so we have this weird issue where the LAN show doesn't know when it broadcast this was three weeks ago not two weeks ago so when it first goes up it shows up as like like when it's just just live it shows that it was a week ago and then we look back now at the ones that are from a while ago and they show a week too late yeah like it doesn't know what's going on so that's the only thing wrong with the original dashboard version that's the only thing that's wrong with it that's probably wrong with the new one too so I'm gonna try the new one you know the one you have you know the one redeeming feature of the new dashboard is if you look up how to do something in the YouTube dashboard that's the only one that they still have in the fa Q's yeah so if you don't remember how to do something you have to look it up then you have to use a new dashboard and that's great at least you can look up how to do something when it's impossible to figure out how to do it natively Oh intuitive should I just show people the coolest thing ever Thank You taka by the way this video this is difficult because there's a lot there's a lot more going on in this then like at normal you like you have a lot of noise happening in this video sir there's a lot of reflections and there's a lot like there's not a ton of genuine static image as a part of this oh yeah I see what you mean yeah so it's an it's a noisy image yeah hey Brandon you hear that Luke doesn't like your cinematography of the yule law that's not what I'm saying that is what you're saying I decide it's difficult to handle he shot it Luke why are you so critical of Brandon I'm not I love Brandon I have a specific day for Brandon he says your image is very noisy well there you go that's actually why there you go Luke yeah so maybe you shouldn't be so unreasonable and be like I thought it was difficult to handle so anyway that video we promised it last year thanks Brandon we ran into some technical difficulties because we are not willing to settle for uploading it at any less than 8k resolution yeah so basically what that means is that we require a special exception from YouTube to upload a file that is way beyond their file upload size limit fortunately we actually have another video service that we work with pretty closely here this media group and we are hoping to have the you log available I have no idea oh yeah easy porque no I mean but that's that's it right no you guys want to do 8k yeah why cuz it's awesome so on the floatplane side of things we're almost wondering how much we can melt your systems because we're genuinely not sure how many people in the audience are gonna have a computer that's going to be able to watch something at the bit rates that flow plane gonna want to output what are you guys targeting it as 8k we're not even entirely sure yet you're a nerd we have to make sure that it's a big make sure that it's like actually possible for at least like 2% of the audience so you guys did a test right have you tried playing back 8k not at the bit rate that we want okay how'd it do at the bit rate that isn't what you want well we haven't actually done that either okay we've been we've been trying to plan like exactly how we want to set it up okay right now we're working on like transcoding it properly which is its own problem yeah cuz here's the thing guys h.264 has a resolution limit yeah so you can't just use h.264 encoding to create an 8k video so you've got a couple of options there's vp9 which is like okay and then there's HEV C or h.265 except that that is stuck in like patent the HEV see specifically yeah so yeah so we're gonna have to play it in something that we don't normally play stuff in which is not a huge deal but there's some like learning steps that we want to take before we actually post the video learning steps yeah writing steps okay alright fine whatever you know what we should do the topic that we promised the people at the beginning of the video here let's talk about the polygons all the polygons will pick up why why is why do I not have a network connection why is this laptop horrible I'm really glad we didn't give this thing a good review I got it all right I'm bringing up I'm bringing up Luke's screen I don't know I don't know if this is the greatest website for images but it's showing whatever it's all good all right the Tesla cyber truck electrifies the truck segment I hadn't seen it from this angle yet me me there is so Rimi there you know what it reminds me of there was this game that I used to play on the Macs in our computer or our school computer lab I think it was called Specter I think it was called Specter yeah here it is okay Spectre gameplay pc game 1991 apparently it was available for PC can I just can I just green share with you for a second here so I want to give a shout out to squeaked net YouTube channel for having this gameplay of this truly classic game here it reminds me of the tanks in this game oh my god yeah oh I haven't seen this in forever so where are they this is this is what I am reminded of and I don't know if this is yeah yeah then I'm pretty sure this is the game I think the Mac version looked a little different or they're maybe they're just operating it in a different mode so if I recall correctly you could oh wait yeah you could set it to wireframe instead of like solid parents okay and so yeah the tanks basically looked like like yeah I see that does that not look like the cyber truck dad that's what I'm reminded of back to your screen for a second here yeah this I had not seen this angle either they definitely chose the worst angle of ever seen as this truck as their cover photo holy the worst thing about this is that's probably how you're often gonna see it yeah yeah and like is it just me or is the bed really small and doesn't have like a lift gate okay a lift gate yeah what do you mean your tailgate it has a tailgate does it okay the tailgate has like a ramp built into it or at least that might be an option or something I'm not sure oh sorry sorry sorry out the tailgate itself is actually very cool okay so my biggest problem with the truck sure is what's your biggest problem with the track so okay I can I can see oh there's 37 photos in here alright fine screen back to screen I will find a foot here ignore the smashed windows but there's a whole different part of the conversation but this part you guys can see why most of it yeah this whole section right here yeah immediately makes it very difficult also known as probably impossible to work out of slash load from the side mm-hmm that's like seems like a massive oversight in my opinion I don't know what's going on there yeah other than that until I saw these photos I wasn't that against how it looked to be completely honest yeah I don't think it's a conventionally attractive truck by any means but I think it's interesting I really like the light bar actually okay and like watching it drive down the street with that light bar on yes like yeah wow that's an amazing amount of illumination so there's definitely stuff that the rest of the automotive industry is going to have to react to here the sledgehammer demo pretty impressive pretty cool I mean it really does just pretty cool it that's very cool I actually really like no paint it really does raise the question you know why has nobody built a truck that you know doesn't get doesn't have the paint flake off the second you look at it too hard on a worksite you know why did it take Tesla to come up to come up with the idea of that you know not everyone drives their truck to soccer practice yeah so that's pretty cool have you seen the camping thing I actually can I say something maybe unpopular sure I actually like the interior because driving I remember this is this is quite a few years back this one I still worked at NCIX it must've been about 78 years ago and I borrowed the company work van and I got in and I was blown away by how bare bones and even been like 15 years ago everything about the interior of this thing looked and felt like it was so plasticky and so crappy and like you know dials like this instead of you know nice knobs for things yes I was just looking at it going this is this is ridiculous like why is there a different standard what people who and even our even our f-150 the work truck have you driven it yeah like compared to you know a sedan or thing it's like what people who work you know when are you know with like tools and the back of their truck they don't want buttons that don't feel like two decades ago like I don't really get it like why don't you just kind of stuff actually I'm struggling to remember the name of it but the Toyota truck that's super popular Tacoma Toyota Toyota Tacoma yeah it hasn't had an interior update in like forever and they they did one with a similar vehicle that they have in their product line everyone freaking hated it because the stuff just kind of works and they don't want to mess around with like electronical stuff as much they'd rather use buttons and dials which I kind of understand if it's a work truck and you're like I just need the thing that I'm pressing to function with the irony being that our fan only does off and full blast in our Ford so true that the dial is clearly not doing us a lot of good here because it's true still electronical control is that is a ford versatile that fairness which is a different currency okay can you search my screen yes I'll show you guys a couple things all right all right this I think is very cool this is really cool the charging okay the ATV that charges in the back is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life the ramp tailgate yep super cool yeah the fact that it looks like it's like tilting up to help you get the quad out yeah pretty freakin cool that's very cool has onboard air compression it has like the amazing amount of output on the battery that you can use for things that aren't just the vehicle lastly the camping stuff this is super cool that's awesome nobody is gonna do that I guarantee you people will do ok people will do that but they are pathetic Tesla fanboys why it's stupid why is it stupid just pitch the tent on the ground it's not camping Oh what do you think of hammocks then how nexor sweet but there's like almost no set-up time when I am on the ground so like but that counts you expect me to object to a hammock why would I but like this probably has more set-up time than a hammock so it's not about the set-up time it's not like I'm not like oh this is not camping because there's not enough set-up time on a board like you're not in the vehicle this is this is tent material you can tell I can tell what it's made of I still think it's stupid no it's stupid I want to see what the audience thinks you can see what they think if you want all right last time you went camping in your life yeah that's what I thought what were you yeah that's what I thought what were you I went camping this summer okay I only stayed for like a night but that was we were gonna do two nights but then I got called away on a secret mission basically a sponsor offered us way way more like it was like triple our normal rate and I was like well I do really have a camping trip with my children and then I was like well they'll probably forgive me and still love me because this is like yeah I'm gonna cover a lot of expenses yep make it up to you kids yeah so I only stayed one night I'm not into camping either I just mean if you're good at camp do it properly that's my point so anyway the single engine rear-wheel drive has a 250 mile range 7,500 pound towing capacity and does 0 to 60 in six and a half seconds $40,000 is way more aggressive than I expected and honestly I think I'm probably not the only one that is surprised by that because I was reading up on some of the speculation about the super cyber you know extra it's way less than I thought okay yeah a lot of the analysis and a lot of the predictions that I saw said that they thought Elon was out of his gourd off his gourd out of his rocker whatever the point is they thought he was crazy when he was saying look it needs to be under 50 grand they thought he meant $49.99 yeah nine whatever how many times that is and they still thought that that was really aggressive most people think the tent is is cool yeah well you know what but not by a lot just because everyone thinks something doesn't mean that is right that's fair okay so the dual engine all-wheel drive has a 300 mile range ten thousand pound towing capacity and a zero to 60 in four and a half seconds for just another 10 grand I think that's probably going to be the one then the three engine 500 mile range 14,000 pound towing capacity zero to sixty and two point nine quarter-mile in ten seconds this thing is a speed demon and that'll cost you a cool seventy thousand dollars that will also so pretty well I've been talking to my brother who drives like big trucks for the movies and stuff yeah when they have to get generators I would have like buried in the mud after like a what like many days of rain after it was parked there forever ago in the thing weighs like obscene a mask it's not like little toy generator their generators for entire sets they like he's told me stories of them taking like super duties and like going for runs like trying to slam these generators over the mud and stuff really like and then like that one gets stuck and they have to make like a train of trucks to pull all the other trucks and the generator out and like they need as much as they can possibly get and he has like a f-150 yeah and there's people on his crew that are like you know like you might need a bigger truck cuz like some of the stuff we have to haul is like a little too much for it right sometimes it is but he's not gonna go by an insanely expensive truck so like whatever but like those will sell the three engines will absolutely sell I don't know and that's interesting I do i I'm kind of mixed on my opinions of it because I I don't think I didn't originally think it looked that bad I think shots like this though with the one with the quad in it actually make it look pretty cool so I mean here's the main question though are they trying to achieve here why did they do this because they could have just as easily done a more conventional ish truck that was electric and people would have bought it for sure for sure so my original idea when I saw yeah was oh manufacturing reasons do you think it's cheaper to do this angular design I mean not do you think actually it's very likely cheaper I am thinking that it's probably cheaper yeah I'm also thinking that it's probably more reliable and easier hmm and what he's been talking about for a long time is we're gonna put up more vehicles we can put in more vehicles where I'm put up more vehicles yeah well doesn't have crazy wing doors yeah it doesn't have all this other stuff it doesn't have fancy curved paneling or any of that kind of stuff there's like two polygons on a lot of different sections on here there's like one Bend of the metal and that's a whole section yeah and like getting that stuff out reliably and easily it's not even painted yeah which is great like that's a good thing in this case but like I think they I'm hoping this means they'll be able to churn them out a lot faster so this could maybe be the the vehicle that they like whip off the light you know what I mean interesting so on stage the team hit the steel alloy body with a sledgehammer to no effect they're using the same cold rolled steel alloy as SpaceX used for its Mars rocket prototype musk claims it can withstand a bullet from a 9-millimeter pistol their armored glass demo failed but okay I'm gonna pitch you something sort of I think they did it on purpose I've heard a lot of rumors with that I think musk is smart enough at this point savvy enough at this point that he knows that failed stage demos lasts a lifetime yeah at some crow he what he was too cool in that moment I will give you that for sure sorry I mean you know developers developers developers or you know what was what was the one with jobs when he was unveiling um she there's a super famous one with Steve Jobs this it's not the speech recognition thing is it cheated for that yeah I can't remember it doesn't matter anyway there have been ones with Apple there's been ones with Microsoft they're they're iconic they last forever yeah and what they do is two things they get everyone posting about it everyone talking about it because it happened so everyone is looking at this event that brings in more eyeballs and more people that are looking at an article that yeah sure has that as the like clickbait you know thumbnail and title and whatever but also contains information about this product and it still took a large metal ball to the window and didn't shatter and number two is it creates an opportunity to talk about something twice yeah when it doesn't work the first time you get a bunch of people talk about yeah yeah yeah then three months down the line or six months down the line you come out and you go hey remember that thing that was a cultural event that everybody knows about and everyone is you know maybe at least idly curious how it turned out guess what we fixed it I think it was a hundred percent on purpose and I'm not normally like a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory kind of person but there is no way that they didn't know what was gonna happen yeah when they hit the glass with a steel ball no way and they they talked in mouths and they're like micron son did yet your dad that you change the seat look is they're back in their official statement thing they even mentioned about how they like through tons of other stuff at the glass yeah and they don't even specify that they threw the ball at the glass and like the chance that they never tried that before they did it on stage is so low yeah at zero it's also it's still a really impressive demo so so says it looks like Elon is using the sonic movie strategy I don't believe that that wasn't so Cameron says does the demo nearly bulletproof sell it to law enforcement oh yeah oh yeah for sure cuz I mean law enforcement is a perfect example of an industry where they want very very low fleet maintenance and low total cost of ownership we was reading another interesting article from a company I forget what they're called unfortunately but they've been using the transit the Tesla transit company whatever they're called I don't remember his his cab or something they only used heads of vehicles and they have like over 300,000 miles on all their vehicles yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and like the the maintenance was like basically nothing yeah none of the battery packs have actually worn out I think the worst was like a 28% reduction in range or something like that 20 something and like none of them had needed a motor replaced and the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the vehicle because they were gonna get an estimated like 500 thousand miles per vehicle versus a typical hundred thousand on a fleet vehicle for an internal combustion engine was like way lower it's like way lower and so I could see law enforcement I mean it's got the speed oh yeah it's got the ruggedness it's got the lower total cost of ownership assuming that did all things that we've done a critical design plan I could even just do partial paint oh yeah for sure for sure like accent paint yeah get some of them lights on there I would be man I would be floored if they okay okay I know there are questions about what it looks like but one of those is a cop vehicle would probably look freakin sick that's true as like as like a space space light like futuristic sci-fi movie yeah like that's what the cops right around 100% hundred percent yeah okay I'm sold now yeah law enforcement vehicle everything else is done you're done that's it awesome now I still have I still have my concerns about the the angle parts by the by the truck bed I still have lots of concerns but the hotel stuff I mean 110 220 volt outlets the those are thick the size of the bed is about like an f-150 not as wide which might be a bit of a pain in the butt for certain things yeah um I guess that's pretty much all I had to say about that why don't we move on to one of the other big topics that I wanted to talk actually Wow we talked about that force so I feel responsible all right so the new YouTube Terms of Service YouTube is rolling out updated Terms of Service on December the 10th a new tube I like it all right that's what you can call the terrible new dashboard okay including a reminder that here we go this is the quote YouTube is under no obligation to host or serve content that is that is directly pulled from the new Terms of Service so various youtubers have tweeted out a segment that states YouTube may terminate your access or your Google accounts access to all or part of the service if YouTube believes in its sole discretion that provision of the service to you is no longer commercially viable kind of stand up here for a second with an incredibly unpopular opinion if you stand up I'll be out of the frame you know it's very ok can i free country sounds good actually it's being if it's a free country they're a business they can absolutely do this I think I think a lot of people look at YouTube especially because they have basically no competitors which is a problem but that's more of the problem than this because like they're not a government service they they can absolutely do that they're a company if something that they're doing is not commercially viable in a lot of situations they're going to not do it they're a publicly traded company so especially yes like we you guys run the forum still not a commercially viable thing no it's really no you do some stuff that isn't commercially viable but like it's at our sole discretion exactly if we decided one day to turn off the forum there's nothing you guys can do about it so if it was in our Terms of Service that we can turn it off if it's no longer commercially viable that's perfectly reasonable and we could turn off like a singular subform or something however I think there is I don't think it's the right stance okay that's totally like yeah I think there is still room for people to feel uncomfortable about it of course you should like you said because YouTube is basically a monopoly yes when it comes to online video services that are accessible to everyone and and has has positioned themselves you too you know like you you just YouTube it you know till they possess changing I think I think this sorry to interject again this feels kind of like this yeah this feels like when Google dropped the don't be evil moniker well bit right yes absolutely but they're losing that thing that really made them feel like what they were so if the idea is that it's you tube and it's a it's it's on them it's their fault that people are mad about this because people wouldn't be upset if YouTube hadn't position themselves first as long as like the public access channels as basically a YouTube video has a utility and you can only know what I mean oh yeah it was a basic human right it's like everyone should be able to upload to YouTube which again the wording their video as a basic human right it's not it's not it's not a government thing but yes they did make it seem like as a private enterprise they basically did it for so long but if they kind of go oh well hold on about that actually could we do well I can see how people would feel betrayed yes and that is in the same vein of this is not a government thing they can do whatever they want absolutely feel betrayed yes you can also do that like that's you got to understand I'm saying kind of both sides here I would be extremely annoyed if I was still a YouTube creator I would feel very uncomfortable and I would try to join but like yeah you know so okay now with that said I do think some of the reaction to this is totally ridiculous I mean one of the first things that I saw here was like you know the usual the usual suspects when it comes to sort of taking a change in policy and finding it a way to turn it into like personal persecution yeah so you know one of the one of the classic groups there and to be clear I am NOT saying that they have never been targeted with policy changes I'm just saying that sometimes because of that history they have a tendency to see a new policy change and assume that it's all about them and actually this probably has nothing to do with you and I think gun youtubers are a perfect example of that here okay I saw gun youtubers coming out and saying well they this is YouTube basically saying that if they can't sell enough you know bullet ads to go in front of my videos then they're just gonna turn off my channel and terminate my access to the service well gosh darn it I don't like that and technically you're not wrong but that that is that is like that is the farthest thing that that's so far away from how you two would be expelled how I would expect YouTube to utilize this this wording in their Terms of Service like that's not what they're gonna do with it that's not what it's for you gotta remember that there's a much broader world out there full of totally different concerns than even the type of content on the channel I would say it is very likely that this policy change has nothing to do with the type of content of the person whose account they terminate or whose videos they remove and the reason I would say that is because here's an example some people don't realize this there are people out there that are using YouTube as basically their own personal cloud storage for free yeah so I go well why would I pay for I do it Google photos or iCloud or whatever if I can just take all of my videos and just upload them private to YouTube yeah where it's free and then I'll just like download them if I need it yeah or I'll like watch them when I want well that's that's not what the service for and that was never what the service was for yeah but unless YouTube has policy in place within their Terms of Service that gives them the ability to just pull that down be like look no you actually can't do that you have you have four weeks to get all that crap off the server or set it public or something because that's this is not what this is for so unless they have that in there they're not going to be able to do that at the same time YouTube is very well known for an acting policy with AI and then just like heavy-handed very large glove smacking and getting a lot of extra stuff that they didn't mean to get yes so I wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of firearm youtubers and and like camping is we've talked about camping a couple times on here camping youtubers get caught up in this all the time because the some of the gear that they have is not like super advertiser friendly because they might have knives and knives just well you're screwed yeah I still remember when I uploaded a video about the original razor blade with switchblade interface yeah that monetization was turned off on that video because CEO because razor in their infinite wisdom called they're like touchscreen with a screen under it or a touchpad with a screen under it technically a touchscreen I guess I called it the switchblade I was like no great that's fine I didn't really need that money anyway cool yeah um and like have you ever talked about your do you even still have it your bit no I don't talk about that oh oh yeah okay so forego a version of this line has by the way being in YouTube's Terms of Service since early 2018 so the update just modifies the wording to sole discretion whereas before it said that YouTube must reasonable belief sorry to interject yeah a like camping knife YouTube channel thing they do a bunch of different other kind of stuff recognized you in one of their videos as they went through and they looked at different youtubers that have shown knives on screen and they like rated the the knife basically they rated my knife and you were one of the like most positive we reviewed people on there why because ladybug you had your ladybug and I think they showed one other one that you had like on your hip and they were like that is very good but the ladybug they were particularly impressed with well they're like that makes specifically very good sense for what he's using it for and I was like that's pretty cool well I appreciate it the heck yet DBK is pretty cool yeah so before I lost like four of them to airport security because I'd always forget to take them off my keychains yeah I had a what's the brand that makes the space pirate what with a spider coast yeah okay yeah I had a Spyderco ladybug that I would keep on my keychain and it was absolutely perfect for unboxing things which is probably I was doing with it oh no there's a smaller one maybe it's not the ladybug is that one all-metal eye maybe there's no that's that's the one yeah leave it yeah yeah you know I might have a girlie name I don't care it's just my knife it was good friend I I thought it was cool that they were like yeah I know that makes sense for what he's doing and I was like aha we should totally do like an unboxing optimized knife that would be sick how would we sell a knife though shipping knives internationally seems like a can of worms get in trouble honestly yeah you might be able to talk to them and they would probably know tell me something Nick yeah okay I know for everyone you know alright so anyway back to the YouTube Terms of Service change basically this is a very small change I totally get it and the YouTube spokesperson oh I hadn't actually read this quote yet said the company is not changing how we work with creators nor their rights over their works or their right to monetize this has nothing to do with that no this has to do with people abusing the service and I totally get it with that said I mean until we until we see how they actually utilize it this is all guessing yes yeah oh that's funny if line is to the Spyderco knife I would totally buy it even if it was ladybug look it's not it's it's a very nice cute yes it's still manly to have a ladybug knife it's actually a very very nice keychain umm what else we going to talk about oh we need to talk about private oh yeah so private Internet access was acquired I've said I'm gonna pull up my email one moment please cuz that's where I actually I'm keeping most of the information about this we've got an email thread internally so they were acquired by what is it cape technologies yeah I think is in the you know what no I don't know if I can say that yeah whatever it doesn't matter point escape technologies also owns two other VPN zenmate and cyberghost sa the merged company is projecting whatever whatever is revenue etcetra etcetra etcetra so here's the problem cape technologies has a bit of a history and they actually have products that appear to have been bundled with I would call it adware at best with adware in the past so this puts us in a very uncomfortable position where we have positioned PIAA as a VPN that we trust because PIAA had a long and proud history of litigating when they were asked for their users records and legitimately caring about their users privacy and their know log policy unfortunately whenever the parent company of a company changes so whenever a company changes ownership unless the acquiring company also has the same stellar track record it puts the users and the people who endorse it in an uncomfortable position where they have to decide whether they trust the the new parent company the same way that they do the company that they were used to working with which is like a nigh impossible thing you basically have to restart from zero so pretty much here's the situation we have decided to give PIAA and everyone we've worked with there has been great partners and I still I've used the service for years I'm still using it we have decided to give them an opportunity to explain themselves and to give us something to go with here to prove that we should still trust them we have asked them to either work sorry whenever we have asked them to either work with us to talk to you guys directly or to give us information that we can share with you guys that should reassure you guys that we should trust them as well and until they are able to do such a thing we have suspended our PIAA sponsor reads so we're not turning the whole thing off we're not blowing it up but we are not going to talking about PIAA until we've had an opportunity to make sure that you guys are still comfortable with us working with them so what that will probably end up looking like is some kind of interaction with our audience whether it's in the form of a live stream or a poll where you guys basically go Emperor honest yeah you go yes or no and if you guys say yeah let's do it then we will continue to work with PIAA and if you guys say no let's not do it then we will work with you guys on what VPNs you guys are comfortable with us working with and then we'll negotiate deals with them and we'll figure out how to move forward with this so that's that's the status update I wish I had something more definitive for you in the case of the McAfee acquisition of tunnel bear it was a little bit more cut and dried for us because we already knew what our trust level was with McAfee so it was just like okay well this doesn't work let's move on whereas this these guys their story about how they don't do that anymore or whatever sounds like you know basically we just need a little bit more time so that's where we're out on that thanks guys hopefully that hopefully that kind of puts your minds at rest for now we are aware of it we are working on it we will get you guys a resolution to it [Music] before 2016 yeah they were under a different name CEO is new or is different from when they were inserting adware into their installers and stuff like that so like I said we haven't got enough information for us to definitively say no we can absolutely cannot work with these guys but we also haven't seen enough to fully exonerate them from what they have done in the past so that's regret what else did we want to talk about I mean is stadia even that interesting oh don't personal Apple removed user reviews and ratings from their website did you see this comment different ladies and gentlemen so this was originally posted on the forum by a William Clell conveniently I am NOT signed into the forum so I can go ahead and share my screen with you beautiful ladies gentleman so this was supposed to 20 hours ago check this out so this is this these are some negative reviews of the Apple pencil really still no replacement tips yes this is the best stylus ever made no doubt about it but having no ability to replace a seven cent piece of plastic at the end of the stylus is more than whatever something something will never know what it said because Apple has silently removed the link to their ratings and reviews page on their online store other sites that sell Apple products by the way have not been affected by this decision so you can actually see from the wayback machine this is what November 16th looked like and this is what November 17th looked like now this is ridiculous I mean that was one of the things that I actually quite respected about Apple was they allowed people to post negative reviews of their products right on their own website and here we are guess if you don't have anything I say don't say anything at all and by the way if you do have something nice to say why don't you just say nothing at all about that to zip it that's not that's not right that's ridiculous yeah I agree and if Apple's story about this was gonna be well you know we were doing maintenance and the link got lost or whatever the case may be don't buy it because the pages have been removed from the US UK and Australian Apple stores so that would seem to suggest that unless everyone made a mistake all at the same time totally definitely completely by accident there's a lot of companies that don't have ratings in their stores yeah that's fair but to have it there and then remove it I think is pretty bad well it's we're back to the conversation about like look if you had never given this to us in the first place we wouldn't be complaining yeah but when your motto as a company is don't be evil and then you remove it the implication is be evil and when you're here and when you're policy is to accept user feedback and you know take it as well if we made a better product maybe we wouldn't have gotten this negative feedback and then you reverse it then the implication is well we don't give two hoots about user feedback and we would rather hide helpful constructive criticism in order to make more sales that's what it looks like to noon yeah you know what's kind of interesting mmm I want to show you guys this just because I find it hilarious how useless it is anybody another piece of bacon everyone Microsoft has been in pretty good graces with the community for a long time now when's the last time there was a strong Microsoft controversy there's a lot of what that does 10 sucked yeah I took like six months yeah but like Windows 10 patches has been terrible for ever they deleted people's data okay okay it's pretty it's pretty bad yeah anyways show me scream ironically though people didn't seem as mad as you'd kind of expect yeah like as you would be if Apple like okay turn on Apple Microsoft like if Intel pulled something like that if Intel had a bug in their CPU and I even point zero zero one percent of users lost one file there whereas Microsoft they actually had a big problem yeah it seems like people mostly kind of forgave see this is my cynical I absolutely detest Windows 10 and it is inferior to Windows 8.1 and it crushes my soul that 7 and 10 mean I got dx12 and not 8.1 uh but I think it's in my in my brace just cuz windows head sucks so bad that they're just kind of rolling with the punches at this point but ok I find this hilarious these are the reviews on Microsoft comm for Windows this is shopping window I know when you scroll this far down it looks like a website from 2008 to maybe but once you scroll up it looks a little bit better but this is the reviews Windows 10 Pro 4 workstation has none it's new it's just not it's not that new windows head in pro 37 no one uses yeah oh man I don't know like what is persistent memory on Windows 10 workstation that sounds very cool I won't look into that feature persist and sorry guys we're learning on we're learning together on the show memory there there video on glass as a storage medium was actually pretty cool okay so supports devices with persistent memory the fastest data storage possible own works persistent memory also keeps your files at hand if you shut down the system or do they just me like obtain this seems like yeah okay i think i think it's opting stuff okay that's less intrusive rover workstation no I think I'm Matt I think it matters so it's like if you wanted to work on like a very very large simulation or something and you needed support for a persistent memory for obtain memory that has to be specifically baked into the OS is my understanding yeah okay alright well is there anything else you particularly wanted to cover uh let me just make sure we got the requirements we spoke about a few things okay so stadia is just kind of boring are we gonna bring people on for that or no I forget it they're probably some probably already there's the I want to try it at least me to like ambhi's and three details sorry I might I'm still sick of my my throat's kind of had had it for it today I think yeah there's some new details it's gonna be on 7 nanometre plus we're expecting approximately 64 core 128 thread max processor so pretty similar pin-compatible PCI Express Gen 4 basically we're just unlike Zen 2 which was evolutionary Zen three is built from the ground up with big performance gains so this is the so aim D is kind of adopted and oh wow I'm reading off my dock sorry about that so AMD has kind of adopted Intel's tik-tok strategy so dice rank but basically the same thing but like you know a little bit higher clock speeds and some tweaks here and there and then re architecture and then dice train can react applause we'll see how long they can keep it up because they're gonna be relying on TSMC to keep shrinking no shrinking nodes and I had a that's gonna be real hard to do for the next little bit here but yeah so we're expecting a pretty significant performance improvement according to what AMD is talking about so if that happens Intel is in for a world of hurt because there's a world there's not going to be a compelling reason to recommend an Intel processor once this drops all right let's move on to super chats what do we got for you ladies and gentlemen thanks LT HT thanks Trevor thanks Christopher thanks Ben Schmidt I missed that broom it had a lot of personality much like Madison who should totally be hired okay if Madison is qualified for a position we will interview

Group Inc it was the middle the other company yep yep thanks Zuko Zee thanks Robin forced OH when will there be other colors of the water bottle got classic and white my wife would like purple or pink I don't know if we have purple or pink in the wings right now we're definitely planning a like a pullover hoodie design with like this cool pink and gold design though it's meant to be kind of more unisex sigh yawn says I will continue to spam useless super chats perfect thanks dawg cyan says I'll save one if I actually care about something maybe okay sigh on thanks Alex thanks Mitchell thanks x shell weeks thanks Christopher Hendrix yeah we're not hiring that it said Christopher and unless we do Luke says have a free super chat thanks Luke Luke Matthew not you yeah yeah yeah I know you'd never send me a super no Mitchell Clark also as someone who has tried to get a job at LMG you realize work permits are a thing you have to deal with right unless we don't if we hire Canadians they're not a thing we have to deal with the problem is not just the work permits because it is actually in fact your job to get a work permit before you apply somewhere because in order to legally work in a country you must have a work permit so we have gone through the process before we went through it with John we went through it with Dennis and it is extraordinarily complicated so depending on your qualifications it might be super easy for John all he had to do was drive to the border so hilarious they wouldn't tell him ahead of time drive to the border and then they just decided he was there in his car with all his possessions in the back and they decided because he had a law degree so it was like a different like skilled worker entry something something they gave him like these uh that he could work with for his wife at the time that was it was much more much more difficult Dennis extremely difficult whole process took thousands of dollars months so you know what the reality of it is for absolutely the perfect dispersed anan the planet we have definitely made exceptions but we already hired that person it's Dennis so for the rest of you we're gonna have to stick with people who have a Canadian work program yeah um gaming life hopefully this helps you guys in these dark times my times all right how you doing there's been some difficult stuff but I'm doing okay all right it's mostly just been like my back being a problem basically all the muscles in my like the back of my right leg and my butt and my lower right back are just destroyed and I have to go on like not even that long of walks and then measure my pain to see how well I'm doing while we work on it it's great it's been kind of one thing after another for you hasn't it yeah but I think this is genuinely the source issue of all of the other we're finally there because I've heard that I know that's fair I don't know dude I know nothing about this stuff about how truck guy says yeah free money cloop 2010 brought to you by gamers Nexus thank you for that mehar el says can't watch day of the computer store Ltd has inspired me to try building my own for the first time Oh can't watch day cuz I'm at the
