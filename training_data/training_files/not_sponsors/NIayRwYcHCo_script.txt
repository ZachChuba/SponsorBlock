whether you need a domain a website or online store make it with Squarespace everybody Peter were kidding here and today we're that's kind of kind of my thing what do you think of Peter McKinnon as a creator is difficult to deny how successful he's been having set up his YouTube channel in 2016 within nine months he had hit 1 million subscribers and as I make this video it looks like he's about to hit 3 million he attributes his success to a number of factors but a prominent one is a mantra he lives by and one he encourages his followers to also adopt and it's this done is better than perfect done is better than perfect basically don't spend ages finessing the details of the things you make just make something finish it evaluate what works and doesn't work and start something new with better knowledge sounds good right but then I thought about all the times that I produce my most successful work and in those times I didn't take that done is better than perfect approach at all in fact what marks those times out particularly is adopting almost the reverse of that philosophy let me give you an example to explain what I mean a bit more [Music] back in 2007 I did a small design job and inviting the catalog for an artist show of the Corn Exchange gallery in Edinburgh although just a simple brief I decided it would be interesting to try to mirror the themes of the artists work in the actual format of these printed pieces the items themselves became conceptual I won't go into too much detail at this where this was probably my most well-received work for my time as a graphic designer the piece ended up winning some industry awards it was featured in a fair few reputable design magazines and online blogs and remains to this day probably the design project I'm most proud of creating but a certain memory from creating this project really sticks out in my mind and it was when I was just finishing up the artwork as a project and it was late in the day most people have gone home and I was still in the studio and all I wanted to do was to leave get the tube home lie on the sofa and watch TV because I was tired so I took the artwork over to show my creative director and he said something that really stuck with me he looked at it and he went oh yeah you know that's that's that's good enough you could call it a day you could go home but I know you're capable of putting in that extra little bit of effort that extra little bit of time just to tie in everything up to make it just that little bit better and it's that extra little bit of rigor that separates the good work from the great work so I stayed and I put in the extra time and I tightened up all the bits that were a little bit sloppy and I got it looking really really good and I think it was that extra little push there elevated it to the level where it received the awards and got recognised I thought about this over time and I think it's this philosophy just putting an extra little push towards perfection there's the key to make your work really outstanding and when I say outstanding I mean exactly that standing out from the rest imagine that we had five different pieces of work a B C D and E and imagine that they are all of a high standard but that the creator of artwork D just put in that extra push that extra level of rigor and as a result D is too that little bit better than the others now if these were images which photographer are people going to hire which one of these works as a publication going to pick for its feature the effects of being just that little bit better are exponential a small improvement over the rest means a big difference in its level of success so does this mean that the done is better than perfect philosophy is bad advice is Peter McKinnon wrong well not really because it's more complex than a simple binary choice between quantity and quality back when I was on my ma might you to run a filmmaking project and I had never done anything quite as intense as what I did on that project there was about 10 of us and we were given a brief make a film exactly 1 minute long and we have one week so we had to devise a concept plan it film an editor and have it ready to show for the next session so one week later we all showed up and screened our films the tutor then ripped into our films harshly critiquing every little detail and telling us everything that was wrong with them we then had to go and make another 1 minute film starting from scratch and again within the space of only a week this happens again and again and again until we have been doing this for seven weeks and made seven one-minute films some of the films I made on that project were a lot better than the others none are amazing but I'll tell you something I have never learned more in such a short period of time as when I was doing that project when I've finished those seven weeks I was ten times the filmmaker I was when I started it and this is the essence of Peter MacKinnon's mantra because Peter MacKinnon's mantra philosophy a is a mantra for learning and that extra push approach the driving for perfection philosophy B is an approach for creating successful work and philosophy a affects the efficiency of philosophy B the more of philosophy a you practice the more effective philosophy B will become but it's also more than that when interviewed on the subject McQuillen states that this is actually advice to avoid overthinking things and while he talked about this in the context of being motivated to start creating with out your brain holding you back one could also view this as a championing of working intuitively rather than analytically and that is something I wholeheartedly support as a method for creation but there's an important lesson here regarding the learning aspect of this don't run before you can walk if you venture into client work you must have the skills first otherwise you will damage yourself I know this from experience a long time ago suffering from the dunning-kruger effect a cognitive bias I made a video on called by bad photographers think they're good so you can check that out from learn more about that I took on some work for some companies before I was really properly ready to do that and at the time I thought it was a great opportunity to get my foot in the door but what actually happened was that I ended up creating substandard work and as a result never got hired again nor recommended by those companies and this is the problem with clients they don't think about the level you're at and that if they hired you again ten years down the line they'd be hiring a very different photographer a much more capable and experienced one they just think that Jamie wins is a bit crap let's not hire him again and we'd all do the same for other things if we went to a restaurant and the food was poor we wouldn't try back there again once the chef's have more experience we just wouldn't go there again not when there are other places to eat so learn as much as you can as fast as you can and Peter MacKinnon's done is better than perfect philosophy is a great way to do this but as you progress start to strive for perfection a little bit more try just giving that extra little push putting that putting in that extra bit of rigor because it's those small attentions to detail that elevates your work above other work and it's that that really creates a big impacts on how your work is received so thank you very much to everyone who supports me on patreon very much appreciate that you are all wonderful people I'm basically trying at the moment to see if I can do YouTube full-time and I'm trying to see if I can make up a salary from a sponsorship patreon selling presets and ad revenue and if those four things combined can make up enough for me to live on at the moment I'm kind he's somewhere around there I need to progress with this for a little bit more to see if it's working but every little bit really helps this thank you very much for people who support me on Windsor to get 10% off your first purchase I'll see you later [Music]
