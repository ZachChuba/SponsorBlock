hello everyone dead spikes here yes in fact I am level 400 and that is why I am making this guy am I the highest level in the world absolutely not and I'm not trying to compete the highest level in the world I just like playing with a lot of different builds and a lot of different gear so I like to power level a lot today's guide is going to be how you guys can power level the most efficient way that I have found a power level I will be going over it if this is not the will help you out now let's get into it there are going to be three guides in the pin to comment down below that you're probably going to want to watch directly after watching this video there's going to be how to unlock mushroom island which is what I will be using there is my mob killing build and then there will also be my boss killing build I do suggest checking out all of those and getting them together to make this process a little bit quicker now as I've said I will be farming mushroom island which is this question mark question mark question mark up in the top left I'll be farming it on apocalypse 6 now this place is just hands-down the best experience farm that I have came up with so far there's a lot of mobs they're really easy to kill and it is pretty quick and the boss at the Adhan gives some good experience as well I'm doing this yourself is a decent farm but I have found that the more people you bring in here the more experience you are going to get so I highly suggest you to bring a four-player squad into here and just grind out you know as many mushroom farms as you can possibly do when doing so it is best to have your teammates split up and go different ways that way you can split the load but do realize that the mushrooms are going to be about two times health I believe when you're out for play or difficulty they are tankier they give more experience and more spawn that's why you want four people I have done some testing actually that I wanted to do prior to making this video and I have firmed it that the more you do level up the more experienced it does take you don't notice it towards the lower levels but definitely up at 400 I was feeling like I was getting a lot less experience so I did test it how did I test it I had some one way lure level than me approximately 150 levels lower than me kill the mushroom boss not kill anything else until they leveled up and counted it and then I did the same thing I killed the mushroom boss until I leveled and recounted it and comparing the stats it looks like you gained about 1% more of an experience bar every time you level up what I mean is you need 1% more experience every time you level up it's not a dramatic amount but once you start getting to higher levels like this you do start to notice it now when you are farming this with friends I do highly suggest you to try to kill every single cow that spawns here also another thing to note if you have not played multiplayer before is if you find a chest and you open it it actually will teleport the loot to your friends there is no need for them to teleport to you I know that is a common misconception on how this game works also if you want to know how this build I'm running works like I said it is in the pinned comment down below this is my ma being build go check it out it's not too hard to get together and I go over a nice explanation on how it's working as efficient as it is as I have said I also have my boss build in the pinned comment down below let's show it on this boss if you and all your teammates have that boss build setup and you guys switch to it to kill this guy you should kill it at about this speed and make it a quite easy farm um that'll do for this video if you guys enjoyed it please make sure to hit that thumbs up button let me know if you guys have been using this too I'm sure a lot of people have make sure to subscribe to the channel for some more helpful content like this you have any questions at all either to stop in my discord or stop in my stream and feel free to ask me live hope you guys have a wonderful day I'll see you the next one this bikes out
