beautiful website make it with Squarespace so good morning everyone hello these are my skates that I have been learning how to skate in obviously you can tell they're kind of trashed especially only outside holy [ __ ] damage but I just want to kind of give them a bit of a makeover today maybe change the laces give these ones a wash and paint something on the side of them and I'm still deciding sketching what I want to put on them yeah I think just having the skates he'll give me a better idea of what I should put on them first I'm going to see how well I can clean them and then I might repaint them white cuz I've done that here there used to be a logo here these are Impala skates but I'm especially like wanting to customize these ones as they are my first pair of roller skates and I'm even though I am obviously careful with them and in them you know they get dirty very quickly I'll probably want to get sick of whatever I paint on here today paint something else like I'm just keen to have a new look for my skates and because I skate outside that's why they're so dirty and because I'm trying things that are out of my skill level I fall over a lot and that's why the sides are all disgusting have I addressed my hair yet see this is the thing I'm filming three videos this week another one the painting that you saw earlier was supposed to come out sooner but it's the painting is just not done and I have no idea what it will be done so I dressed it in that but now I'm gonna have to address it in this video because this video is going to come out first so yeah I got my hair cut these are my license I buy all my stuff online I think these are fun things called Derby core some places I don't know I really don't know anything about brands or skating or just anything in general I don't I don't know anything oh yeah I have different color laces so I'm gonna grab those so I have these white laces and I have these green laces oh yeah and that's the brand that I was talking about cool oh that's backwards I'm thinking I might do white laces just because unless okay if I paint something green on them I'll do the green laces green and pink if I do my green and pink design but if I do anything else I'm gonna go with the white license just to eliminate any like crazy color combos but now I am going to clean [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let's continue painting but when I said let's adjust meeting me you're not allowed with a stranger you might talk to us or ask me questions about myself before I've decided that you're gonna ask me questions about myself hey I sit too close I'll call the waiter by his first name our eat Oreos but eat the cookie be part of the cream but what scares me the most what scares me most so what if when he sees me what if he doesn't like it what if he runs the other way again what happens then here for when he knows me he's only disappointed I'm not prepared but I'm scared of breaking over so I can't hail from home babe I'm just fine sorry Michele shaped mind look I get the best view okay I've got my skates on to do I'm so happy with how they turned out but I am NOT going to take my camera with me skating because I'm not at the level where I can hold very expensive things while skating so I take my phone with me and see what happens [Music] [Music] [Music] I wanted to show you guys this really cool plant that I got the other day it's just like the most beautiful colors red orange yellow green brown but like wow you're doing such a good job I'm gonna trial think of the more videos I make the worse I get at bending them so bye
