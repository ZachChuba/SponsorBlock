[How GFRIEND walks in a cross pattern.mp4]
We'll start. Start! Good! Come up front. [Talking about how each other is funny] I'll go there first and come back. Then I'll go front and come back that way. [Restarting shooting!] You guys are suddenly so good! [Started laughing again]
We're trained with cross dances. But not everyone should be showing their backs. Sorry! Wait, pause! Sorry! We can't proceed because everyone's laughing. [Everyone was showing their backs because they were all laughing] It's kinda cool though It's good until here, but then everyone moves to the back from this point. I'm staying here. And everyone is going back. - What's this?
- Everyone's going to the back! Everyone couldn't hold their laugh in, so they're looking back. - Our backs look cool, but we were laughing in the front.
- Yeah. We were laughing as we were walking back. [Reorganizing the routes!] Let's go again~ Go! It's cool. [Complicated]
Okay~ Show us your faces! Everyone turn back once from your spot! Let's all turn and look here! [YERIN crying in the corner] My gosh! Someone laughed! Who just laughed? She's crying! It's so funny! Raise your head! It's so funny! Teacher! [Calling for the makeup artist]
She's crying! - It's so funny!
- Please come here! It's so funny! Too funny! YERIN is reflecting on things she did, looking at the wall. - Everyone is looking forward and I'm the only one laughing.
- I couldn't hold the laugh when I heard you breathe. It's so funny.
