hi folks welcome back to the model 3 man channel this is crazy i'm looking at my phone and i'm going across to the shares and tesla's just jumped 138 dollars now this morning that's crazy those of you have several hundred shares that you bought very cheap many years ago you're probably walking around with a permanent grill in your face those of you who bought them and then when they got it to 500 or 600 thought that that was the end of the ride me and then sold are kicking themselves anyway second guessing never helped anyone today is the day today is the day that i'm going off down to the tesla service department in a few minutes they called the car in to check that the high tension lead on the high voltage battery was secure they had reports that some of them were not well connected secondly as you know the glove box just began flopping open all the time as i drove so they're going to look at that and probably put some stronger springs to hold the latch closed but thirdly as you all know i sprung for full self-driving which obviously was a bit of a puzzle to many of you who thought that model 3 man is against full self-driving as you recall we had several episodes where you all entered the debate of course i was never against full self driving if elon gets 99 of full self-driving treat it as complete it's absolutely going to revolutionize transportation and i'm for one thrilled to be a part of it i'm still going to be getting full self driving i hope you didn't understand my rent to me that i didn't consider it a worthy product i can't wait to buy it i know that it's going up in july the 1st i'm hoping that the price will drop so i sprung four thousand dollars some of you wondered why it was so cheap well i was one of the few people that were back at the enhanced autopilot a non-existent level today we're in because of the legacy purchase we made a few years back so we've simply graduated from enhanced autopilot hoping elon would give us full self-driving free well he never did so i paid the four thousand and listen some of you guys kindly donated to defray that horrible expense but i'm not going to use it for that i'm using it as i said before for equipment on this channel to make my uploads better to make the videos more professional to get me equipment like gimbals and extra batteries and things that i actually need for the channel so thanks for all those donations so five minutes and i'm leaving heading downtown and then of course i'll need to recalibrate because with the new computer calibration has to be done all over again before the car will allow itself to go to autopilot and before we can do all the fun things i cannot wait to try out so we're on our way it's uh as you would expect raining in north vancouver we're going from north vancouver downtown crossing the gate bridge and heading into the service department tesla west 4th it's been pretty cool to be able to schedule my service through the tesla app not only can you schedule it but you can also amend it you can add things to it and so at the moment mine has a total of three items the original reason that i was called in for to check the connection on the high tension lead then my glove box began messing around and then i went and purchased as you know full self drive and of course i asked if they could put the computer in at the same time and they said that maybe not and then they texted me to say that appears to be possible looks like we can do it so they've added that to the service schedule then i had to approve the princely sum of 0.0 dollars this absolutely is a gray day in vancouver i think christopher cross wrote a song about rainy day in vancouver and this is really it getting closer to the service center right now one block more and then we take the back route get into the bottom and check in yes so this is the rental that they've left me with it's it's got the word ford on it i believe that the increase in daily valuation recently of tesla has equaled the full valuation of ford anyway i got the privilege dubious privilege of driving some little ford i have no idea what it actually is and i'm really concerned that i even remember how to drive a gasoline car which sounds stupid but for six or seven years i've heard the nissan leaf and then i've had the model 3. um anyway we'll make do in the meantime they've told me it'll take about five hours they've confirmed that the hardware version three motherboard is there is ready to put in so i'm really excited about that and later in the afternoon i'll be getting a call from them to come in and collect red dragon well i'm back and i've got a lot to tell you i want to just mention how extremely efficient it is working in the tesla app especially in the service tab where i can approve the quotation before it gets done i can approve the invoice at the end so when i go to pick it up that's already done it's out the way let me mention that when i picked up the car he told me that it would take about 100 kilometers to recalibrate well that sounded excessive but you know i wanted it to do it properly so i began driving and of course every time i double tap the stalk to get into autopilot it said cameras are calibrating please wait until calibration is finished and there was this nice little circular clock-like face with a bit of a blue mark slowly beginning to advance you can see it here and that gave me some indication of how patient i needed to be as the calibration completed when i got to the end of the calibration i discovered that there were certain things i still could not do some of them were because other cameras needed to finish calibrating so i jumped in behind the wheel drove out on the freeway and just kept going until i saw that those camera calibrations had also been completed then i got back to a parking lot where janine works and i stopped and i thought why am i not able to activate traffic light detection stop sign detection and all the other really fun things that make full self driving so exciting there was a tiny little message you can see it here and it said additional maps and navigation maps and data has to be downloaded first so i headed home and i performed all of the updates there were two updates might have even been three that updated the games and then finally updating new navigation maps navigation data but i'm excited to see how well it recognizes traffic lights pedestrian crossings stop signs four-way intersections no more talking let's get out there and do it folks we're taking the car out for the very first time with all the cameras calibrated and with full self-driving now installed and our brand new hardware 3.0 motherboard sitting behind the glove box we're going to go through a few lights four-way intersection we're going to come to some stop signs we'll have a look at what it does with pedestrian crossings and all of this just in our local area we'll have one camera pointing at the screen over here and the other camera will be janine filming the lights ahead and we can see how it goes so let's get going all right so now let's get into autopilot there we are auto speed restricted to 50 which is fine we don't want to go anymore okay is it gonna see these lights oh yeah but i can see them flashing on there it didn't actually stop did it let's get going and see if that was an aberration or exactly what we need to expect of course it's detecting traffic cones as it normally does so we're into autopilot again that's autosteer and traffic aware cruise control and hopefully light detection stop sign detection we're coming up to an intersection this is a pedestrian crossing but the lights are not on so slowing through traffic control it says well it's not bad here we are now coming up to a set of oops okay you hear that stopping for traffic control in 25 meters i'm seeing a red line across which is the front and keep it in auto steer of course so i'm going to tap the accelerator because it needs a prompt so looking ahead there's a stop sign ahead but it's flashing green it says stopping for this control in 50 meters but i'm going to tap the accelerator how this works in this software update is that you have to actually indicate that you want it to go through see it's detected that it's green i tap down on the gear stalk and it goes through now of course it's going to stop because there are cars ahead which is obviously what we want stopping for traffic control in 75 meters so it's detected the lights i can kind of see them over there and there's a red line showing where we would actually come to a stop if we were the only car hopefully on the way back we can do something where i am the only car approaching a light and it'll have to stop on its own so it still says it's going to stop in 50 meters i rather hope not so i'm tapping the accelerator and that gives it the go ahead to simply go through a green light but you can see the green lights over there very nice okay we're coming up to yet another set of traffic lights a little way ahead now i can see the lights and soak in the car so there it is stopping for control in a hundred meters i'm gonna have to press the stalk to give it permission to go through but you can see the lights are blinking there just like they were in the actual uh traffic lights has it seen the red light yes it has there's a red line across and behind my maximum speed you can just see the indication of two traffic lights that's pretty good once the traffic gets going i will tap the stalk or touch the accelerator either will do the same touch the you accelerator see that the lights are green there is another set ahead and yeah it says stopping for traffic control r but it is orange amber red what i noticed is that it changed here where the traffic lights change it was virtually instantaneous that was very fast as they changed the color changed it's showing one two three four sets of traffic lights and there are one two three four that's pretty impressive showing the traffic cones on the left it's showing the red line which is the actual intersection barrier so what we need to do now is go back and take some back routes through stop signs i'd like to actually be the only car at the traffic light so we're going to run this one again here get into autopilot of course we've got a pedestrian crossing ahead and i'm not sure if the lights are not flashing whether it'll stop we want to see even if it's aware of it so it says slowing through traffic control so it was more a case of slowing after the traffic control but it did it and it knew that there was a pedestrian crossing now we have a pedestrian crossing ahead with orange lights blinking so what is it going to do there it says stopping for traffic control but i'm going to put my foot in the accelerator to allow it to go through and going to indicate to the right now it's just so hard to trust it so it's detecting all of the lights you can see it over there we'll stop just behind the line that's good unfortunately i can't drop it back into autopilot until i see the auto steer symbol appear we'll go right through there's two more lights and we turn right and we'll come back along a back route let's see when this changes so i'm looking up at the top there i'm looking at the real lights does it even see a green arrow not really it sees the orange yeah now that was when it changed so let's go through the intersection and get ourselves back into autopilot so we're coming up to an intersection that has green flashing lights i don't want it to stop so i'm going to press down on the stalk to allow it to continue another one ahead that is solid lights it's going to stop unless i this time i'll push the accelerator to let it continue still wants my hand on the wheel of course now we have a red light stopping for traffic control tends to stop with a lot of ferocity but no that's not bad nope human would have done a smoother job but that's not bad now it's seeing all of the red light signs and once again we can try and see how quickly the screen changes to the color of the actual lights now and there we go through the intersection we're going to do a left turn the other road yep coming up to that blinking green light we'll duck out of auto steer a little uh dead end here is it janine and it goes through okay this here it's still moving i see so that's good for us i'll take it back route back oh it even noticed the stop sign i'm not in auto pilot but it definitely was aware of it and we're basically in the linn valley rec center so i can get out here i think yep another stop sign ahead and it just spotted it that's very good i think all of this obviously comes from the navigation data the database that it downloaded last night so ultimately it was a lot of fun it was exciting for me well it was a new purchase there had to be some value in spending the four thousand dollars but it was exciting to see it in a state that was so much more advanced than when i just had the hardware 2.5 where it did basically autopilot on the freeways and it didn't do anything as far as stop lights and stop signs were concerned i can see the potential i'm excited to watch it grow and yesterday elon said that he thinks he'll get to level five autonomy by the end of this year that's 2020. we all know elon time sometimes takes a little bit longer but if he's thinking of level five already by the end of this year and even if that slips into halfway through 2021 that is astounding i cannot wait to experience that and my channel model three man channel will be following that journey and i'll be reporting back and uploading videos you'll share in it with me as we watch it grow and that'll help you to determine in fact whether you see any value because it's not just what it can do it's what it brings to us the drivers the people who are in control of the car that's the journey i'm on right now and i am excited so thank you again for watching thanks for your generous donations through paypal thank you for using my referral code when you could have used anybody else's i appreciate that so much and in the meantime please keep safe until next time look forward to seeing you again thanks for watching this episode cheers for now you
