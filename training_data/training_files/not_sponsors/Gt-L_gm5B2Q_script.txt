this is my hardcore iron man he's only playable in a pvp world and if you manage to take me out you make me sad and i pay you 250 mil to improve my survival chances at any combat level i have two choices i can either upgrade my gear or i can upgrade my food currently i'm on defense and i aim to stay that way for a while so upgrading my gear will do nothing for me therefore this video i'm gonna set out to work on my food get opera when you're back at your pc kicking things off here with 44 prayer now i can use eagle eye which is my best range prep available ever because i can't do raids let's get out there it's scary i had to stop off at the library though on the way back and finish off 100 percent arsenal's favor because now i can lock that in and gain favor with other houses arceus favor locked in oh my god i'm feeling so lazy right now a sidious favor i'm gonna use 20 on it [ __ ] it probably gonna regret that down the road but i can go straight to thieving fruit stalls i am blessed here with these fruit stalls do i want to die in multi to a team or do i want to die far away from the bank in single combat so many decisions golem of a fruit top that means i can boost my herbal level by four if i make the pie i chose the multi-zone because why not no he found me oh my god what are you doing here nice no fruits for you i don't want him to keep checking for those dungeon that's where i wanna that's where i wanna go it's worth noting that at this point i want to get my food upgrades from the grubby chest and you need 57 thieving to access it oh i'm training thieving this is so obvious i'm gonna do it i'm gonna say that it doesn't have the thieving level to even do the grubby chest true oh okay yeah i don't have the thieving level either so i'm not gonna get the thieving level for the chest and then i'll never think to look there for me the master plan oh he actually left as well okay i need to play this smartline i went back on my main to see if i could thieve in the single area in combat so i couldn't get hit by a peak here and these three boys flying at me see the engineer in the gang of course i'm an idiot because you can't actually see from the fruit stall in combat 50 fire making the master plan is to make it look like i'm going for desert treasure and 53 thieving rather than going for 57 for forthos hey some new fresh meat there are way too many hardcores in these worlds right now [Applause] [Music] garbage ass weapon doesn't even i can't teleport because the teleport time are you serious you kidding he was there you kidding me [Music] came out here to the desert to do a bit of blackjacking which is normally relatively safe but they knock down your hp levels so i am a bit under threat of being one hit 42 hp i don't want to waste my food either 53 thieving the required level for desert treasure which means we're gonna stop here i'm sticking to my word we're looking like we're doing desert treasure 38 her blood for prayer potions i'm going to need all the prayer parts for my next bossing adventure welcome to my home for the next week 4thos dungeon no one is down here malty thankfully we're looking good all monsters within the fourth asp dungeon have the ability to drop a grubby key this gives access to the grubby chest at 57th thieving the grubby chest is one of the only sources of sharks brews and really useful potions on an early game iron man which is why i'll be exploring this place today possibly you've never seen someone do this i don't i did not know this was a thing we have to do a boss fight as part of this mini quest the shaded beast it rains my prayer points by 5 per attack so i counted it by bringing 10 prayer pots all right shaded beast down and for this i believe we get the temple coin remember this door i can't go through it right now and i can't go through all the doors in fourth house dungeon without doing the mini quest this is the end game 57 thieving for the grubby chest if i use the temple coin from the mini quest on this little hole here i can crawl through into the bone burner room where i can burn bones and unlock all the doors within the temple i can also unlock this door with this lever here so escapes everywhere 100 baby dragon bones sacrifice now i'll get prayer xp from using this burner it's three times the rate for a normal bone and we also get this altar again we can use that to recharge my prayer 45 prayer from burning baby dragon bones on this burner it's actually a pretty decent prayer method there is my first grubby key is 1 in 80 off a baby red dragon so i've been a little bit dry for that these are the best things to kill in the dungeon and after 200 bones sacrifice i gain access to the temple key which unlocks all the doors in this place so now i shouldn't die here well let's not speed too soon um hello this is why i've never really played hardcore guess it's all over then i got a hard clue scroll my first one i actually moved on to the druids for a bit because i got two temple keys off the dragons and it's a bit boring getting nothing as drops so i'm killing these guys a patol i can actually do that step of the hog clue oh yeah remember this door in and out i can pass freely through it so i saved the names then save the tree now i'm starting monkey madness oh my god i basically had to do the entire quest to get access to a woogie to do this clue scroll step but hopefully it's gonna be worth it it absolutely was not worth it i'm just enjoying this account way too much to be doing that on step two of a clue is actually suicide [Music] osrs curious that's one of the only pvp accounts with a bounty [Music] the bounty for pk his ultimate iron man was 30 mil when i killed him it goes up over time and he makes youtube videos i would recommend checking him out only mil to go i came for some magic activities and i've used up all my rooms four keys from this trip and 55 mage to match my range level i am now balanced again at 45 combat looking strong taking a break from the dungeon it's time to get my hasidious favor up to 100. i'm choosing to dig these saltpeters i can bank them at the deposit box and i can get to my house probably with the food in my inventory 800 salt peters have been collected so i can match those with my buckets of compost and there we go enough fertilizers to blow up the grand exchange trade them all in i could have done the metal but you know don't want to do that meeting i do not want to attend i do not have the time to waste i just have a lot of smithing to do today i can't attend what kind of wet excuse is that well after a long meeting here is the end of the giant dwarf quest we've got some meeting notes from the very long meeting it's literally like two paragraphs okay these quests are so horrible because i have to stand outside in the open in the middle of pvp for anyone to attack me for two minutes and that's the end of a second story finished off on a drunken night in the pub that was long but big farming gains and cooking gains we can now do rfd we have 30 farming for my next task chefs are the wiki lied to me the wiki lied oh my god hello there mr c engineer chef's hat acquired and the reason we needed the hat was to buy a bunch of garden powers from the cooking guild this will increase my farming level by three meaning it is time to start farming brothers quick rounded compost for 31 farming 31 plus 3 is 34. what we doing tithe farm i need 34 farming for these seeds but if i use the garden pie there we go no one's gonna know i'm here unless they know about the boosts i've got no food on me right now which is horrible but once we get inside i should be fairly safe you need 100 favor to get in here and you also need 31 farming first trip completed 35 farming meaning i don't need the boost anymore so we could take some more normal food so it's a little bit safer the goal is to get 45 for the guild if i get tb'd in here there really is not much of an escape i'm trying to think what i would actually do i've got the snares to do something but i don't know if they're going to let me escape with that oh it is nice handing in all the threes 9k xp drop for farming 39 now we need a couple more runs this is the risky bit going out into there yeah okay cool no one's saying that my farming level's going up okay we're safe we're safe we're safe get back in there come on come on nice [Music] oh my god that scared me okay someone found me a tithe that's a hardcore ryan man what is going on that's a hardcore man why am i on this account snare him oh unscoutable really no way they were definitely ready for me to come i should have waited a bit longer and here we are the farming guild another thing i can use the garden pies for so hopefully nobody will really think about coming here for me and the reason that we are here farming contracts dwell berries don't have any seeds yet we're gonna have to do some thieving everything is grown just want to get a few early seas because i'm not coming back here there's such an obvious location seed pack won anything good dwarf weed seeds what's on earth bit of a high level for an easier 55 thieving trying to get bloody strawberry seeds yep they are so rare and mine died the good old sorceress garden back to this place again i can actually pick the forbidden fruits of this tree mash them up and then that is the plus two thieving boost the squirt juice it is time to use the grubby key as well i've been waiting for this entire time drink the juice get through this door it works nice we have six six chances for brews please i just want bruising restores come on 200 law runes is amazing and sharks sharks are good if we get full in with those sharks i'm happy these keys could be the absolute game changer on this account but we didn't get anything good we just got sharks no bruise for me kind of regret leaving all these egg potatoes on the floor but you know who puts egg on a potato is that a thing i do however have a superset and 16 sharks which i'm very happy about decided i could not be satisfied with just 16 sharks and i'd have to get at least a full inventory if not some more i thought that was a brew then i saw the yellow oh my god the runes are good though sharks are good let's get this stuff ranging potions as well i've just noticed ranging potion oh my god nice okay okay okay now we're talking i think i'll be able to get a full inventory of sharks from all this there we go how much better am i looking now full inventory of sharks plus some combo food and tallies or prayer potions it's going to take a lot more to kill me if i do get tb'd now this is an extra 100 hp pretty much in the back
