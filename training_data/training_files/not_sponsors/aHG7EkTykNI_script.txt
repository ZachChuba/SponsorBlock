place aren't you [ __ ] useless prick jeez the most important item in every man's wardrobe jeans are not the most important things in a man's wardrobe James Bond has taught me very freely that if it never watched a James Bond film in my life but James Bond has inferred to me through his marketing techniques but the most important thing in a man's wardrobe is a concealed weapon because they're super versatile you can wear them pretty much anywhere I'm sorry but you can't wear jeans anywhere and if you think you can wear jeans anywhere then you're absolutely [ __ ] wrong at my funeral if

approved because I [ __ ] highly doubt it Aksum eyes your look and sexiness by exposing those forearms Wow ok well technically I was actually doing that trick without knowing it this looks cool right it's safe it's it's it's fine but if you want to look dangerous like a sexy stylish ninja all you got to do bang ok if you feel like it's gonna help them do it not really a big fan of ice unless I'm getting paid by the hour but can you hear that worst thing I've said in my life isn't it my castrate myself for that deserve it any guy can do to look a lot better is upgrade his belt the any time I wear it that was if it's romanette simple thing you can do to look a lot better is to learn how to military took if you're not wearing a tailored shirt I don't believe in this trick I actually only believe in wearing things that do not fit me in any way whatsoever as long as the item doesn't fit me I'll like it but if an item fits me well feel a bit sick I'm not quite sure to it I think it's something to do with my eating disorder and body dysmorphia but we're just gonna brush over that and keep talking about his issues equally as important as your clothing is your hairstyle apparently if you haven't got good hair no lady is gonna want to show you where what's throwback Thursday isn't it the vintage jumped out tuppence no lady is gonna want to show you our tuppence unless you have a nice hairstyle take it from me 6 simple things that any guy can do from better hairstyle I just want you to know that I think you are amazing each and every one of you actually kind of like this guy now sure I would like his hair tips though so one of the biggest mistakes I see guys making that is absolutely killing their hair game is they're using way too much hair product mmm disagree just about that much not that much wrong also disagree with that don't waste a damn long in between cuts to ensure that your hair looks as good as possible is keep it cut on a regular basis that's an incorrect way of doing things do you want my hair advice seeing as I've got better hair than this guy hasn't better hair than half of YouTube I actually look quite disgusting as a default so I've had to learn how to make myself look nice over the years and my top tips are don't overdo it always put your hair product in from the back forward and when you feel like you're ready you're not take a tongue brush brush your tongue your breath stinks look in the mirror and then vibrate as hard as you can for 10 seconds and it will put a lot of stress and tension in your face and I just feel like it gives you that good ooh I'm panicked and I don't know what to do about it situation look moving on we've got P P stands for predatory actions only if you're an alpha male there's one thing that you do have to be sure of your hair looks nice your clothes look nice you smell good your breath is fresh because it's about yet ruined time to chomp down on some Fanny boys no one wants to be a nice guy and everyone wants to be a bad boy when I say bad boy I don't mean a terrorist go from nice guy to bad boy that every woman want six steps sorry the instructions weren't clear enough I joined al-qaeda there's nothing wrong with being the nice guy and if you're cool having 37 female best friends in this video isn't for you but if you would rather have those same 37 sassy senoritas trying to rip your clothes off why not throw one so I'm ripping my [ __ ] clothes off there is nothing more annoying than when someone's tugging on the outfit that I've so delicately prepared I don't care if I'm on public transport I don't care if I'm [ __ ] murdering you there's no excuse to touch me stop asking permission hey it's happening so hey don't make plans is Friday night me who tacos pick you up at 9:00 it's that easy don't pick me up at 9:00 you greasy [ __ ] bastard [ __ ] off there boys take action they take control and they go where they need to go Hey ladies I'm not sure if you're in the business of seeing a nice guy or not but if so straight out of luck because I'm so sorry the only thing I've got in stock is bad boy by the Dozen you want an arsonist that's me you want someone who's gonna join al Qaeda that's not actually me but I might do it and you never know because I am a bad boy this next video is the five best tips for alpha male body language from how to be learn how to attract women with body language and get more respect from men I can't wait first trick of being an alpha male is if you're watching videos and how to be an alpha male just watch it on two x speed because a lot of them speak out very slow and drawn because they're very stupid mind an hour a middle and emotional state is a reflection body so when we're carrying ourselves in a confident manner it's also gonna improve our mindset and this make us feel and act a lot more confidently as well I literally hate being calm and confident I love being erratic and unpredictable those are my favorite personality traits I like people turning around and saying oh god what's Tom doing now oh not sure but it's probably something detrimental to his or my health wild card baby first tip I have for you is to commit 100% to your handshake I actually give a firm strong handshake like you're excited to see the person or a nice strong hug now one of those act awkward like half-ass hugs where you stick your ass out and you barely even touched what cut them non sticks their arse out when they're given a handshake or a hug who are you hanging around with me alright guys my second tip is to continue touching people throughout the conversation oh yes there's nothing more attractive than when you continuously touch someone throughout conversation especially when it's in a semi-professional environment highs doctor apparently you have some diagnosis for me we have had your test results back and they do show that you are going to pass in the next week oh sorry I help you sir just wanted to feel like an alpha male and you're telling me I've got an illness and I just wanted to combat that by stroking your face and showing some physical affection but you guys are both like laughing your ass off or smiling at that point it's the perfect time if you're talking to a guy you know dab them up or give them a pound ups right men if you're laughing your ass off with your boys it's the perfect time to give them a pound just before you give them a straight facial all right guys the third tip is simply to stand up straight and to use correct posture also if we sit up properly we might have a mental repercussion which is a great idea because the only way I can feel mentally confident is if I take two tubs of ecstasy I'm literally massaging my temple with a sharp stick to hopefully not remember any of this information because you can only remember certain amount of thing over your lifetime and I don't want any of this to be any of it slow your roll we tend to move faster and talk faster when we lack confidence and we get anxious nice slow deliberate movements this is gonna calm you down it's also gonna exude confidence sometimes if you speak too fast or speak too unprepared some people may lose interested in this and so you should slow the roll as speak just without any rhythm hopefully you speak so slowly somebody assigns you're a responsible adult okay and the fifth and final tip I have for you is to smile geez a big part of social situations is learning how to smile correctly for that situation an example if you're a funeral parlor you don't want to be giving them the whole you want to give them the more subtle and sorrowful and mournful this video is from David at how to beast and it's called how to approach girls works every time okay same way you want to warm up your muscles before you start lifting heavy weights you want to warm up your social confidence muscles give it a few strangers a high-five or a fist bump and get down and do some push-ups in public and that is gonna get your mind right so I went down to the local village center and started doing press ups in the middle of the street I'll just get ran over but no one would give a [ __ ] no one would be like oh look at that confident young man working himself on the street they would be like oh you're a Public Liability and we're running you over don't take this guy's advice you look like an absolute belle end and don't give people high-fives in the street for no reason because you will look like a pedophile I'm feeling loose so let's get it started with the first approach hi this is extremely random but I think you're super here thanks there's nothing more this woman wants to do than leave this guy situation true out for Halloween let me know know what was your excuse for that like labs all the time I'll let you go definitely pretty awkward I wanted to throw up for the entirety of that how on earth can you describe that as pretty awkward Jesus Christ man I'm definitely off my game a little bit today and that's all right you have to realize that we're all gonna have off days I've never had an off day in my whole entire life so I don't know what this guy is talking about Alfa's if you're watching this you're not allowed to down day there's no such thing as a bound a get out there and smash it and go and chase that hot sexy poon you've increased your style you soared your hair out and you've made an impression on the ladies and now it's time to make an impression on the world and that moves us on to H HS for have no shame whatsoever no dignity nothing not a sliver this video is titled how to be the life of any party five easy tricks again they're simplifying the whole alpha male experience out for us which I do appreciate because we are [ __ ] idiots hence the fact we need these videos bro sometimes trying to think of new video ideas is like the hardest thing ever oh snap you guys are gonna like this oh snap I'm gonna like this one because it's like every single other video that he's posted whenever I meet someone new I try and add a little bit of personality adding in something that you know about that person or something that you've heard about them is gonna create some instant rapport you know what this guy is right if you mentioned something you know about somebody in your first meeting with them it's gonna create an instant rapport I like to go up to somebody and blackmail them whisper in their ear something terrible that they've done that I know about and I know about everything don't do anything nice for me and whatever I want whenever I need it it's gonna be very big trouble for you instant rapport may embarrassing yourself in public when you're an alpha male is actually surprisingly easy in between to win cheesy parkour push-ups in the middle of the street and giving strangers fist bumps and high-fives you're gonna embarrass yourself pretty quickly but if not don't fear this traps got some great advice about how to dance in public when I make eye contact with someone across the bar or across the room I give them no reason should you ever be pointing at somebody across the bar in such a way it's embarrassing and frankly everybody's looking at you thinking you're absolute idiot every once in a while throwing something like this if you do that in a public setting you will get fully yeah that's one with a white t-shirt and the tattoos he put something in my drink if you want to be the life of any party then just cause drama for no reason whatsoever if you're that guy in the corner of the room chilling with your drink and you get super nervous bro you're gonna stick out like a sore thumb yeah people pick up on that girls will find that so unattractive no offense love but rather attract scurvy then attract to you no one wants to look like the quiet intelligent in the corner of the pub everyone wants to constantly be the R so in the middle doing the worm Tom's top tip is don't be that [ __ ] doing the worm in the middle of the pub because everyone thinks you're a massive [ __ ] now that you've got the look you've got the girls and you've got the public humility we can move on to the final a a is for are you overworked and depressed if not then you're not an alpha male no down days [ __ ] turns out if you want to be an alpha male there's not actually a list of

never apologize good plan mate if you run over a child last thing you want to do is say sorry to the mother back over the child again commit to the job every man don't gossip or talk [ __ ] you know what I actually kind of agree of this one as a closing statement I think it's a really great idea never talk [ __ ] about someone behind their back I always talk [ __ ] someone's face if I'm gonna be talking about you behind your back it's probably a nice thing might not tell you that's your face because I don't want you to think that I like you as a person and we need to feel very insecure and not sure about where you stand in my life they don't avoid eye-contact makes you look timid it makes you look scared it makes you look weak sometimes I do avoid eye contact because I do wear contact lenses and they dry they're extremely and it's not very nice to stare at someone directly in the eye thinking oh god they're looking at my cloudy retina thinking I've got glaucoma nope no glaucoma hisses just insecurity you've figured out how to dress you figured out how to talk to ladies you've also figured out that you should have no down days and you should embarrass yourself in public
