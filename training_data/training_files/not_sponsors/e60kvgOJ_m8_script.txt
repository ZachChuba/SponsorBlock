[The shooting day of SuperStar GFRIEND, SOWON & YERIN trying out the game]
- I tear up when I play this game, because I don't blink,
- I'm watching. Are you ready? Nope! You know whenever you try to start something a part of your body itches? Start! [Starting with Vacation!] It's okay, you're good. Not dying is my goal. It's fine. [Endless screams] What is this place? What is this place? Hey can you try the 'Be with You' one? - I'm thankful for just staying alive!
- Not dead x2 - Just surviving...
- Can you try the 'Be with You' one? [YERIN curious about the 'Be with You' which is known to be difficult]
I tried it and I died in 3 seconds Really? I'm so curious I've never tried. 'Be with You' is no joke. It's supposed to be the most difficult one. - The 'Be with You'?
- Yeah. What am I supposed to do? Like this? - Is it that hard?
- Yeah, I can't. - Really?
- You die instantly. I think I did about 5 seconds though? What? [Fingers all over the place with the intro] What? What? OMG I think you did more than 5 seconds just now. It's funny I'm not dead yet. Wow It's like it's raining... Oh oh oh! That's what happens when you press that... I actually still don't believe I got past the most difficult part. Wait do I have to restart? [Can't stop the 'Be with You' challenge]
I didn't even give it a try and I have to restart? I don't think I can do this. - This...really...
- I can't 100%. [YERIN letting her instincts take over] I'll go with the hard one. [Trying 'Be with You' once again] Just turn it off. [YERIN letting her instincts take over 2]
Really last try. This is so hard! I have shorter thumbs than the average people. She's literally so focused right now.. You're doing great! You're the best out of our team. [YERIN acknowledging SOWON as the best player in the team] I can't do the separate ones. I have short thumbs! [Finishing up somehow] Imitating you - How was it? x3 I'm in tears.
- But this one... I'll give it a try. I'll go for 'Be with You' again. [Leaders don't quit!] I'm tearing up. I just hope I succeed. This game has a side effect, I think I'm stretching my trapezius. [BUDDIES, the right posture is always important!]
Always keep the right posture.
