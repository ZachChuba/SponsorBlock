of my video description down below so I wanted to show you all a new ruskin stuff that I really like done by the artist name phase it's called the Frostwolf armor set I'm a contributor of the set as well here's the artwork completed Vevey is to promote the set the new armor set is a continuation of the art done for the Frostwolf a kay if you've bought it or have seen it in the game but with this rendition it's released as a metal face mask and metal chest plate I'm gonna link both items down below for you to check out and you can also like and comment on their steam page as well both of these skins are being considered for today's skin cell on the Russ store later today I think it would be really cool to see both of these skins in-game so I'm going to be randomly selecting one patreon supporter every two weeks from now on to play a full life with me and you're going to be featured in my new season six that I record next check out my patreon if you would like to have a chance to play with my team and I and be in some of my videos you can choose any tier support on my patreon to be entered into the random draw and I'll be announcing the winner in my desk board at the beginning of July both my patreon and discord links are down below so this video features more of a progression after finally finding our main base location I'm gonna be uploading more often now that I've actually finished recording this whole season there's probably ten more videos to wrap it up it's definitely a longer season and we do some amazing things please enjoy the video the following is vanilla rust [Music] dude I don't know if the grenade launcher was a good idea to add in yeah people seem to like once they breach in the raid they just shoot them in kill everyone like you just shoot three and it's like a guaranteed everyone's dead and son yeah and people don't use it for anything else pretty [ __ ] easy to get it to you know you get a couple yeah especially a few in a bigoted group yeah I feel like it's a good kind of concept but I feel like they should have added something else reaching Wyatt yeah it's already hard enough to defend the ignore ending so yeah for breaching you can't repair [ __ ] for so long oh [ __ ] I got something yes beautiful no and I asked isn't this beautiful is it sarcastic it's best thing ever all explored listen but my favorite is the top literals are that point hey whatever it's never face right this wasn't rated already enough yeah I like that self oh okay you picked this out there's the SKA oh [ __ ] that's good no I mean yeah Cecil sure yeah yeah smile a little bit I don't mind oh okay cool yeah no we can look into the fairness beautiful did that should see if anyone's in there you know chillin definitely not Gumby oh I dig it let's get out one of these man yeah how much metal do you think we need to make that beast like 30k going going in yeah yeah I mean we can do the board and like the first layer Hani come I think with less than that but I didn't actually want to take the day after we really just need to get the bunker down and then the triangles up I had the monk err so that it can mask the how high the foundations are after that I think it's appeared okay well I think we have the or like there was what 12 K and the furnace and then there's like a bit more up top yeah we already have four smelted here matter of keeping it going good um do you still want to go to the desert yeah where was that it was it right by the river there after to heaven TC crafted do we want to go and just like slap it down we could yeah I'm in a fear if you're cool to do that yeah we could get like just the core ready and then once we got the metals voted over at night yeah I'm done to do that I want garage doors yeah bro what in the [ __ ] right I got honestly take garage door over an acre right now Sam yeah same soon as shop on the [ __ ] any other shops down there I don't really know anyone on the server I could ask Jeff that would make our lives a lot easier yeah do you need me to carry anything like oh I've got a bit of room we just bowed over and I'll bring the fuel yeah how many doors you need I'll make them right now single or doubles doubles and then a cold lock for TC and spring the high quality Hyundai call I got three key wood to gate metal 100 iclone six bags and feel gonna make an immense aisle cheapest it's just to make a large furnace base spray next to it because it's four stories highest not yeah I don't know if we have the stone but we can do that Emma later I guess burnt you want to get a rat suit in a Sargon yeah sure I might meet some like Python guys I'm sure you missed it earlier you do mmm know how we found foreign bears in the same spot earlier the other yeah yeah I found them again the same spot yeah I can tell by the like sheer amount of leather yes in terms of stone to make the furnace veins four storeys high what is that you would probably need what like 12k stone I mean we could maybe do it right next to this build we're doing over there did we have the hand mates like one and no yeah but we do have one whoops mmm do you guys care if I line it no I called few 80s the
