should move we don't have wires hm lazy should be on cameras i'm assuming he's on cameras so we should be able to see that i am here okay well peter's in here now hmm i think hafu is also going for a marination tactic right now what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] that's wild what's wild um wait wasn't the one pre-tracking lights yeah he was for a while i don't know if i want to see where the body is yet okay so okay i want to hear from hafu steven five up where did you guys go i went to comms uh i went i came out for that part she was in yeah so while i was in o2 and then i went to columbus i went back to check in if dk was still probably tracking lights he was and then it went out again and then i went to oates that's a self-reporter do you want my full my full route i can uh corroborate no that's enough i wasn't sorry there i went to coms after i saw armada and hofun there so i was on cams for that entire round watching uh hafu peter five up and dk dance around o2 and then i get off of cams i go down and tk's body's in the hallway right before lights go on the camera doesn't see in there uh well i wouldn't see four lights go off right before lights went off uh at the end before lights went off yeah i didn't see five up in there i wanna clear glue i mean i was heading to the lights from call yeah aria looking good arya and gloom have been holding hands for the entire round basically it looked like five of them only did it took me awhile to realize you were protected yeah no i did water wheels also who's on cams oh that was lazy the entire round there weren't many kills oh oh oh you think that because i was on cams i wasn't killing yeah that's wild well steve was on your point steve was at the place of the body by the way he was at camp sitting with me the body wasn't at cams the body was not at cams yeah but you were at the hallway to cam oh boy that was a bad event that was a bad event he was questioning stuff the nice thing about killing above here is people don't realize like you can't see who's above it if there's people below that's why i was able to get away with that um we'll do this with tina gonna marinate tina i think i said i will do it initially and i'm gonna do it again all right um watch this hold on i have a play no oh my god get off the cameras you lazy people oh my god then they escaped who is it they can go this way who's on cameras you yo what the heck what the heck that is so sad armada explain oh all right so it's you then tina oh wait what do you mean the thing is like okay so i was on an admin table checked uh and then i went up to vitals no one was dead go back to admin table and the body is there the last two people i saw was peter and tina peter's ahead of me in spaz peter came out uh from spas i can explain what i did so in the dark i did water jug or in office and then i went over and did cart's life i saw how we do those things what are you doing oh yeah you are you were right and then i went into specie because i didn't want to have specy the task late i went specially did 1-10 and uh download uh and then 5 up came in at that time and i thought someone was going to murder me so i go down uh i go left i see bottom decontamination open so i thought oh [ __ ] the pincer move i'm [ __ ] dead i go back in this messy and accept my fate i see hafu in there do one through ten and doesn't she doesn't kill me i'm like oh [ __ ] thank god i go left i go out i see armada on admin table and then the body gets reported mm-hmm yeah he came out of the top spencer mm-hmm okay see the kill wait i want the people i left um lazy purple with in vitals were arya tina and gloom or maybe i think it might have just been aryan gloom yeah arya and gloom have been holding so you guys should have seen something right no no not not me not not this round but oh never mind did see thought it was you because we just ran maybe we ran across the body together armada which is why i think it's you but well i think it's you or you at least what a spicy kill that one was we got a good one i don't want to kill tina okay steve is locked in there armada's in there too amada's eight seconds uh i'm hoping that these don't get fixed yet all right now i walk this way off i need to wait for my kill go down she needs to wait on mine explain your kill to me i need like three paragraphs on that oh that's crazy i got a sneaky one in nice that was nice to not feel bad for five up anymore i feel partially marinated just a tiny bit please oh my god like not five of them wait so what's your perspective there gina because that looks like so bad dude i thought it was you i was like what the heck like we cause well to me i guess it looked like you were just just on the body i was like oh i snuck in the left side of office immediately saw him kill him ran away and then you report oh michael cafo did you like kill in front of me on admin table because i like just passed you when when that guy is rushing i need to take a xanax oh same i'd like to pee i i didn't kill anyone stephen you need somebody no i'm kidding that's a it's a dangerous thing me and five got a double kill in o2 and then we double killed uh to win yep i didn't kill anyone aside from that round okay oh it's five you
