4chan is a website over being pretty messed up most of the time it isn't really possible to visit the B board without witnessing at least a few of older things in addition a lot of real life could be stuff was revealed the 4chan before going public for example this man strangled his girlfriend and posted a picture of her dead body the 4chan before getting caught I've actually made a video about the entire topic in the past if you want to watch it anyway back in April of 2013 an anonymous user made a post on 4chan that has since unnerved a lot of people in 2014 this post was made the 4chan that consisted of some coordinates left this area on Tennessee the poster told people that there was a secret prize hidden for them at the location underneath plastic this obviously caught a lot of people's attention and there was a lot of speculation as to what could have been at the location some people thought it was a dead body a bomb or maybe drugs oh yeah and this guy thought it was a dragon dildo one person eventually got the idea of telling people to send police there since it wouldn't be safe to actually go there to see what it was the original poster ten minutes later said there were no cops there and then a minutes later asked if anyone was coming later he started posting more pictures first he posted this picture of what looks like a decaying hand then he posted another picture of some bones stating he was angry that no one was there finally it posted another picture of a black trash bag in some dark location not much happened after that for a few days until a brave soul named Alex decided to take a trip down there see what was actually in that location he kept the users of 4chan updated life by taking pictures on his phone and uploading them as it was exploring Alex posted a lot of various pictures of some areas on the place that he was in as you can see it's a really dark and only had to illuminate anything was his phone flashlight he found a lot of things such as wires which were odd to find an enter basement some old pills and a mailbox with dead animal bits inside eventually he finally find his plastic bag with a quote unquote prize in it inside the bag was mummified rat or possibly a bad and a paper plate with writing on it on the back of the paper plate there was a hard drive which Alex put into his pocket also inside of his foam thing there was a tied up tortured possum that darted away once Alex freed it the turning point of the situation is when Alex reads the writing on the paper plate it reads plate to date a very important mate you shouldn't have come here I lied eventually Alex's that he hears someone outside driving slowly over the gravel this is signed to get out of there as quickly as possible before the original poster on 4chan finds him first he attempts to see if there was another door II can escape through unfortunately there were no other doors but he was able to find a small window but he tried to escape through sadly this was actually a vent not a window so he couldn't escape through there either totally freaked out at this point Alex made one last post from his phone saying you try to run out through the wooden door that he came in from nearly enough that post was the last anyone heard from Alex again he probably did not end up getting out of there safely because if he did they would have made another up day of telling us what happened because of this when people assume the original poster on 4chan showed up and killed Alex before he could get out I'm not gonna lie the entire threat was pretty unnerving especially the ending of it at first glance it also seems a more believable considering that other real-life primes have taken place on 4chan in the past we've want my opinion on this particular event I think it's fake mainly because some stuff that happened here just doesn't make much sense first of all it doesn't make any sense as to why he decided to take pictures and post them to 4chan as you went it seems really inconvenient I'd like most people will just record it as a video then upload and once I got out that detail in itself isn't really what made me think this was fake though it was really weird was when he heard the original poster from 4chan come back and then tried to find a way to escape when he first says he heard someone he does he's going to try to find a way out then he upload this picture of the mailbox then he uploads another picture and tells us he couldn't find another door so he's trying to escape through what he thought was a window after that he uploaded another picture saying the window was not actually a window but I was going to try to escape through the wooden door here's why this is odd if you really knew he needed to get out of there because the lunatic from 4chan was on his way down to the basement area the mine on earth was he posting so many pictures like this as he tried to escape all this is doing is slowing him down most reasonable people would probably just worry about escaping first and then updating everyone later I'm not claiming for 100% that this event was fake but in my personal opinion I'm pretty sure her was a staged event regardless of whether or not this was authentic it was definitely an interesting thing that took place and it definitely creeped out a lot of people thank you for watching and I'll see you on the flip side hey thank you for watching I'll see you on the flip side
