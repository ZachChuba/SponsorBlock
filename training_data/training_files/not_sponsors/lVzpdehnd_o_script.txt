by signing up at SK LSH slash real life floor 25 whenever you're flying in an airplane and you're looking out the window you generally feel pretty safe air travel after all is statistically the safest way that you can travel but what happens during the rare times when it's not safe and how could you survive if say the plane exploded up in the air and you had a fall all the way down to the ground without a parachute it seems impossible but surprisingly people have done it before and none have fallen from a higher distance than vesna vulovic the woman who survived a fall from 33,000 feet up in the sky volovich was born in Belgrade in what was then Yugoslavia and became a flight attendant for j8e which was Yugoslavia's national airline less than one year after she had gotten the job and at the young age of only 22 she was a part of the flight crew on j8e flight 367 On January 26th 1972 the plane was flying from Stockholm to Belgrade with two stopovers along the way scheduled in Copenhagen and Zekrom and it was in Copenhagen where the original crew was cycled out with vulovic as crew it was a fateful accident because vulovic wasn't even supposed to be on the flight but the company had apparently mistaken her with another flight attendant also named best know regardless she and her crew boarded the flight anyway and the plane took off from Copenhagen towards that grab the flight initially went smoothly and everything was calm for a while but 46 minutes into the flight when the plane was just above the town of Srpska cummin itza in Czechoslovakia something unusual happened a bomb went off in the planes luggage compartment the plane was cruising at an altitude of 33,000 330 feet when the explosion took place and as a result the entire plane broke apart into pieces there were 28 people on board the plane counting all passengers and crew members the cabin immediately became deep pressurized and everybody was blown out to fall down to their deaths except for vulovic at the height of 33,000 330 feet the height that everybody had to fall from was essentially the same as Mount Everest with Mount Washington in New Hampshire stacked on top below vich however had a series of almost miraculous events on her side that saved her life first when the explosion happened she was hit by a food cart that pinned her down in the back of the plane fuselage this prevented her from getting blown out of the cabin like what had happened to everybody else after falling in horrific freefall the entire 33,000 feet pinned inside the fuselage landed at an angle in a heavily forested mountainside covered in a thick layer of snow that helped to insulate the landing further vulovic suffered from very low blood pressure this cost her to pass out and lose consciousness the moment the bomb went off in the cabin depressurized this also prevented her heart from bursting by the force of the crash impact on the mountainside below which had lied about her heart condition during her interview at j8e out of fear of not getting the job and had apparently drank a quote exorbitant amount of coffee to pass her medical exam a local Czech villager who lived nearby quickly arrived at the scene of the crash to search for survivors and discovered below vich alive inside of the wreckage she had been screaming at her turquoise uniform was covered in blood while volovich was indeed alive she had suffered a fractured and hemorrhaged skull both of her legs were broken her pelvis was shattered she had several broken ribs and a three broken vertebrae but still alive she may have died from her injuries inside of the wreckage and we would have never known that she survived the fall at all were it not for the local villager who discovered her and who just happened to have been a medic during the Second World War he managed to keep her alive long enough for emergency services to arrive that took volovich to the closest hospital and it was there that they managed to save her life she suffered a coma for a that had complete amnesia of everything that had happened one hour prior to the crash up to the moment that she woke up again the last thing that she remembered were the passengers getting on board the plane she woke up to her parents who had to show her a newspaper article about the crash before she believed what had actually happened to her the bombing of JHE flight 367 was likely part of a terror campaign conducted by Croatian nationalists against the Yugoslavs the very same day of the plane bombing a train traveling from Vienna to Zagreb was also bombed Croatian nationalists carried out a total of 128 terror attacks against us lob civilian and military targets between 1962 and 1982 however nobody was ever held accountable for the bombing of j8e flight 367 in two dates no arrests or suspects have ever been made in connection with the attack as for vesna vulovic she continued to live a long life after she survived the impossible every year after that was kind of like a bonus year that she can enjoy afterwards she regained her ability to walk only ten months after the crash and she spent a total of 16 months in recovery her parents had to sell both of their family cars in order to pay for her medical bills but still she was alive since she had no memory of the fall she never developed a fear of flying and wanted to continue being a flight attendant the airline's feared the publicity of having her on board another plane though so they moved her down into a desk job vesna vulovic became a kind of celebrity in Yugoslavia afterwards who was celebrated as a hero across communist Europe and the Soviet Union she was never able to have children of her own due to complications from her injuries and she was fired from j8e in the 1990s for taking part in anti-government protests against slobodan milosevic in what's possibly the lamest smear campaign ever conducted in history kro Milosevic tabloids attacked her story by claiming that her plane had actually been shot down by a Czechoslovakian and that she had actually only fallen from a slightly lesser altitude regardless her facts won out and she continued to live her life until 2016 where she passed away in her apartment from her heart complications she was 66 years old and she died 44 years after she was supposed to die aboard j8e flight 367 the Reaper comes for everybody eventually but sometimes people like vesna vulovic say no not today and the Reaper had to wait 44 more years before he came knocking [Music]
