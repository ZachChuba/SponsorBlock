welcome back to new rockstars I'm Erik Bosse and Nick Fury's sneaky sneaking throughout the MCU has always been nearly impossible to track this is the guy who faked his death well enough to fool two Avengers hid an infinity stone for over a decade lived in hawkeye's barn for a bit and apparently has a scroll duplicate of himself at his disposal and it is this insane twist revealed in the spider-man part from home post credits scene that has led to one of the most perplexing mysteries that fans are still wondering about how long has the Squirrel Talos been posing as Nick Fury how long is Nick Fury been in a scroll Space Station where are Nick Fury shoes last time he trusted someone he lost a sandal a new theory has emerged about the exact timeline of Nick Fury's recent history in the MCU and his relationship with the scrolls there is actually enough evidence to suggest that the Nick Fury we have been following since 2014 in Captain America Winter Soldier has in many key moments actually been a scroll a deception that is it's too much and first 30 days of this amazing streaming service for free ok recently on reddit user Jacob wall face theorized that Fury has been replaced by Talos as far back as Captain America the Winter Soldier and that Nick Fury's cameos in age of Ultron agents of shields infinity war and endgame like far from home were all Skrull fury it's an interesting theory because yes there are some inconsistencies with Fury's past behavior that I had pointed out in past episodes of this show like in Captain Marvel a major plot point centered around the fact that no one ever calls fury Nick yet in the infinity war post-credits scene Maria hill referred to him as Nick three times also pointed to fury telling Carol Danvers that he never eats toast when it's sliced diagonally but some have wanted out this one scene in age of Ultron where he does slice bread but I have to say folks no matter how many times these online Gunter's claim it to be true fury does not cut that bread diagonally look at the slice closely there are clearly four corners four sides you cut it into rectangles also it's bread not toast just please stop quoting that stupid BuzzFeed blogger whoever said that first trust the guy who spends every waking hour staring at frames of more films it's not diagonal I do love that reddit theory though the problem is it has been partially refuted by spider-man far from home director John Watts who confirmed that the Nick Fury we saw at Tony Stark's be an early end of Avengers endgame was the real Nick Fury not towers he said I think it's the real Nick Fury at the funeral and I think Talos got a debrief from Nick Fury about this the last time they saw each other so this tells us that Fury post-2014 could not have been exclusively Talos but I do believe that after Winter Soldier many of the times we've seen fury we've actually been seeing scroll fury let's start with the Winter Soldier in this film Fury fakes his own death after being shot several times in life-threatening spots across his body miraculously he survives something that he probably should not have been able to pull off and really what have benefited from having a second version of him to step in but the ending of Winter Soldier is thematically significant for Fury's character he torches this eyepatch he goes off the grid he says he's headed to Europe he actually looks over his own fake grave with an awesome Pulp Fiction reference on it and he tells Sam and cap do you better even ask for me tell them they can find me yeah I think that theory is the real guy it would just be really weird that was Talos impersonating Fury for all these big character moments but I will say I'm not convinced that he actually went to Europe I don't care what the prelude comics suggest Nick Fury's shield security apparatus on earth has collapsed other than the Avengers there's no one on this planet that he could trust and that is why I believe Fury's next move was to go off world I'll explain how that works but first thank you to our code new rock stars okay back to fury in space I believe that after shield collapse in 2014 fury worked with his scroll contacts who build a new security force a Space Command spinoff of shield from the Marvel comics known as sword with its Space Station headquarters known as the peak I think that is where Fury is and the far from home post credit scene and I think that is why earlier in that film Talos and Sauron discuss Kree sleeper cells I thought Kree having sleeper cells was top-secret information again Nick what does this mean for the fury we've seen in the years since 2014 well the Fury in Avengers age of Ultron definitely seems a bit out of character I'm not talking about the bread thing which isn't a thing stop trying to make it happen but wince cold it's dark in the barn about building Ultron theory says artificial intelligence you never even hesitated Yuri talks as if he has a lot of experience with a I turn on humanity now it could be referring to Arnim Zola that ghosts in the machine but I don't know if that was a fully artificial intelligence the way Ultron or Jarvis were you could make the case that this could be Talos referring to the Kree supreme intelligence which was a true AI involved in some very sinister manipulations when giving his motivational speech to the Avengers in hawkeye's farmhouse fury says here we all are back on earth so why would theory say back on earth none of the people in this room had left the planet at this point aside from Stark I suppose throwing the nuke through the wormhole in the first Avengers but really that was just for a few seconds Thor of course comes from another planet but he was on his own side quest in this moment in age of Ultron to me fury saying back on earth reminds me a lot of that big telescope in early on and far from home mr. bet is from Earth just not yours yours was changed from ours in the far from home trailer a hint that this fury isn't from earth and I believe neither is the GAVI extraterrestrial in the Clint's farmhouse later on an age of Ultron fury and he'll appear on a Helicarrier to help rescue the secona it's nice right pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends presumably fury had some old spy contacts that allowed him to hijack an old shield Helicarrier and storage but I doubted the government or the still Hydra influence shield remnants would make that hijacking that easy maybe Fury's friends are the scrolls who could have helped him hide an extra Helicarrier we know that their space shuttles have cloaking technology as does the Helicarrier which could have stayed in Earth's orbit they could have kept it specifically for rescue operations like this one as refugees themselves the scrolls would consider that a top priority this humanitarian agenda was specifically called out in the scene this is shield this is what shields supposed so I think we might be looking at scroll fury in age of Ultron I think the same could be true for the fury who saved bits and Simmons and agents of shield and of course the fury that we saw in the infinity war post-credit scene again Maria Hill calls him Nick three times and they're driving just as Fury and he'll we're rolling around in a black SUV and far from home Talos and Sauron just love driving he'll mentions that they're monitoring satellites and fury mentions contacting Klein at control I think they both could be referring to their scroll command center in Earth's orbit on the peak that would make it tell us and Sauron who dusted away at the end of infinity war who knows what happened to the real fury in Hill but five years later I believe the fury at Tony Stark's funeral is the real fury as what's confirmed like everyone president this funeral is there for their own personal attachment at Tony Taylor's wouldn't need to pose as fury here just for appearances sake but I do believe that fury attended this funeral and it was here that he received Tony's eat it glasses but he shortly after return to space had Tails resumed his post and passed the glasses on to Peter Parker the latest switcheroo in this ongoing Olsen twin style bonk on between two Fury's allowing him to keep Bo's something he can only do if he is willing to coordinate eight do you think the Nick Fury and age of Ultron infinity war was actually the scroll Talos comment down below with your thoughts follow me on instagram and twitter at a boss and subscribe the new rock stars as we seek to uncover every total
