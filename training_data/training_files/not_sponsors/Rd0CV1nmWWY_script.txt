trade increased the cities of Amsterdam Prussia and unhappen prospered and soon these trading posts became more and more integrated into the Hanseatic League a sort of trade agreement in the North Sea after the Viking raids had ceased through both conquest and inheritance the Dutch counties came under the control of the House of Burgundy they then passed it on to the Austrian House of Habsburg they pulled the Netherlands out of the Hanseatic League and then took over control of trade themselves this is known as the era of the seventeen provinces but by this point the merchants had begun to embrace Calvinist Protestantism this led to the Dutch Revolt also known as the eighty years war also known as the Dutch war for independence the war was a complex mix of secular religious and mercantile motives but saw the northern provinces unite in the Treaty of Utrecht against the Spanish Union of Arras the Spanish marched north though and managed to take back most of the south in 1581 the united provinces declared themselves free and independent and the war became about securing that declaration during the war the Protestants in the South fled to the north and the French Calvinists called the Hyuga nose followed suit making Netherlands a firmly Protestant controlled nation and in 1588 became a Confederated Republic because they couldn't really find a good king instead they instituted the start holders with the house of orange-nassau but only with the provinces approval the Dutch were very good at two things by this point water and money so they combined them and formed the Verdana de austin Dasia company to begin trade in the Indian Ocean the Dutch Revolt overlapped with the broader 30 Years War in which Spain was defeated and finally recognized as independent in the Peace of Westphalia Jewish settlement increased as the tolerance of the New Republic was appealing to the persecuted Sephardic Jews as well as growth in the small community of Ashkenazi Jews the V OC brought immense wealth to the Dutch Republic revolutionizing modern banking and finance that citizens enjoyed shares in the company helping spread the wealth more evenly this fuelled the dutch golden ages of art architecture and building of universities making huge strides in science and medicine the voz dominated trade for half a century founding trade colonies all over the world it wasn't all rainbows and sunshine the voz operated with little to no oversight and were often very violent and engaged heavily in the slave trade they eventually lost this dominance to the English but their legacy as engineers and shipbuilders and financiers continued to spur growth this became aggravated by Dutch merchants lending money to foreign powers thereby protecting and growing their own wealth which simultaneously stagnated the economy in the Netherlands while propping up for our nation's but you know that's capitalism for you the decline in prosperity and the devastating anglo-dutch wars soon made them prime targets for French revolutionaries overthrew the Dutch and created the Batavian Republic then monarchy under Napoleon's brother before final annexation into the French Empire including the southern Netherlands when Napoleon was defeated the Congress of Vienna created the United Kingdom of the Netherlands merging with the southern Netherlands to create a buffer state between France and the German states William the first of the House of Orange was made King however it was pretty short-lived because the southern Netherlands was almost all Catholic and the French language was far more important there the South fought an independence war and broke away from the Dutch forming the nation of Belgium the Dutch returned to their economic ways and were decidedly neutral during the first world war after the chaos died down they found themselves battling the great depression mostly by furthering trade with their colonies in Suriname and the Dutch East Indies this was halted during the second world war in which the Netherlands was invaded to bypass the Maginot Line the small country fell to the Germans and its Jewish population were deported and killed in the Holocaust Rotterdam the second largest city and major trade port was firebombed and completely destroyed by the Luftwaffe the Dutch East Indies was lost to Japan in 1942 Operation Market Garden was part of a larger strategy to cross the Rhine River to advance into the northern Netherlands and northern Germany but it was deadlock and they ultimately failed to capture the crossing at Arnhem in September of 1944 instead the troops would concentrate on vessel and reefs on the Rhine to liberate the Netherlands punching a deep hole through German territory and invading from the east this incredible military achievement saw the greatest paratrooper landing in history with more than 1.2 million allies involved and massive success for the Allies who were able to advance around the Dutch
