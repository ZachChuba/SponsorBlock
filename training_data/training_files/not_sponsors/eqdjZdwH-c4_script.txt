hello this is chef john from food wishes
comma with pizza diya that's right I'm watching TV the other day and I see a
commercial for something called a papa diya and at first I thought wow they
finally developed the technology for folding a pizza in half and then I
thought hey that's not a bad idea except have to make a pizza first and then
I thought or do it what follows as my attempt to make one of these things
just using a pan and not to spoil the ending but this totally worked so with
that let's go ahead and get started by buying or making some pizza dough and
what I have here is one batch of our famous Wolfgang Puck's pizza dough that
I've divided into four portions and what we'll do using just enough flour so it
doesn't stick his roll this out into a circle just about an eighth of an inch
thick and one great tip for rolling out pizza dough because it tends to be
fairly elastic while you're doing this if it won't stay rolled out and it keeps
stretching back just stop rolling for a minute and let the dough relax and then
continue on and you'll see that should make things a lot easier oh and the
other tip is while we don't want a ton of flour worked into this we do want to
make sure we have enough under the dough so it doesn't stick onto the table once
we have this rolled all the way out and as can see I just like to sort of
drag it across that sprinkle flour on the table so as to pick up just the
right amount but anyway one way or another we'll go ahead and roll that out
nice and thin oh and please be aware when pick this up to put it in the
pan it's always gonna stretch out a little more so I will generally roll it
out about an inch or so less than the size of my pan okay so my dough is
looking good and at this point we can head to the stove to prep our pan which
means getting it nice and hot over medium-high heat and we'll also give
that a fairly generous brushing of olive oil and you'll probably notice some
little wisps of smoke coming up as I do this that's fine since it means it's hot
enough but as soon as we place our dough in we will immediately turn our heat
down to medium and I will tell why in a moment and as soon as that dough
hits the hot pan you're gonna notice lots of little bubbles forming which is
great news because not only does that mean our pizza dia crust is gonna be
nice and airy and light but also once we flip those over those
bubbles are gonna kind of brown and char and they're gonna give this thing a very
beautiful in highly enticing appearance so eventually this bubbled side is going
to be the outside of our pizza dia and that's because after cooking this for
about two minutes we're gonna go ahead and flip it over revealing what we'll
call the smooth side yeah smooth except for those giant bubbles but that's fine
because as we spread it over our pizza sauce which is the next step we'll go
ahead and press any of those down and as we do that not only will this smooth
side become actually smooth it will also become covered with sauce and then what
we'll do once that's been administered let's go ahead and transfer on the
toppings of our choice which for me is going to be some mozzarella cheese some
sweet Italian sausage some mushrooms and some red onions and just like when we
make regular pizza we don't want to overdo it with the toppings so please
show a little bit of restraint otherwise their proportions are going to be all
off and instead of a pizza deal could accidentally end up with a pizza
Rito which actually doesn't sound bad but that's another video but anyway
having said that of course how much is up to I mean are after all the
Pappajohn of how much to put on but no matter how much use we'll probably
want to leave about a half inch to an inch of dough around the outside around
the outside around the outside so when we fold this it doesn't all squish out
and speaking of folding for best results the non cheese ingredients should be
placed just on one half oh and the reason we turned our heat down to medium
is because it's gonna take a few minutes to get these toppings on and we don't
want that crust underneath charring too much by the time all our fixings have
been placed down but anyway once that's been successfully chopped we'll go ahead
and take a spatula and we'll make a crease by pressing gently into the dough
exactly in the middle or as close as we can get at which point we'll carefully
fold this over and then we'll evaluate okay if it's beautifully Brown and as
crispy as we want when go ahead and serve it but if we want this to grill a
little more which I do we'll go ahead and brush that very lightly with olive
oil all right not too much just a light coating and then we can go ahead and
flip that over always by the way turning towards the same side otherwise we could
have some molten pizza fillings falling out due to the physics of a flimsier
fulcrum and while that side is getting a little
browner we'll go ahead and brush a little more olive oil on this side and
we will simply continue grilling this flipping it from side to side as we see
fit until it's exactly as brown as we want and because our dough was so thin
by the time it looks like this it's going to be fully cooked through and
that's it we'll go ahead and remove that from the pan and plate up and we will
cut that in half using a pizza D wheel and if don't have one just use
a regular pizza wheel and then because I have to take pictures of this I went
ahead and served a little salad along side and since that was only lettuce in
oil and vinegar I decided to grate over a little bit of parmigiano-reggiano
which always makes it better or as a James Beard Award winner would
say elevates it and that's it after taking a few pictures I grabbed a half
and dug in and I absolutely loved what I produced okay it really did have the
taste and texture of a folded over slice of pizza which reminds me I could have
made this look a lot more visually impressive by doubling the toppings but
I really did want to stick with the same proportions that get on a pizza and
while it might not be that easy to see especially since I keep holding this out
of the frame there really was plenty of that stuff to go around so I'm
officially designating this experiment of great success and not just because it
was a very delicious thing to eat with this relatively fast and easy procedure
allows to do is make a single portion of what's very very close to
pizza in a pan on top of the stove in just a few minutes without ever having
to turn on the oven and by the way if do a search for pizza dia
don't really see this all right what see instead is an actual quesadilla
made with flour tortillas which is then topped with sauce and cheese and
whatever to make a pizza which I'm sure is lovely but that's actually a
quesadilla pizza and not a true pizza deal like this and of course if you'd
like to argue about that I'm on Twitter but in the meantime let me just finish
by saying I really do hope give this a try soon so please follow the links
