Guys, on this date five years ago, we uploaded the very first episode of this show Messy Mondays. That's a long time to be doing the same show and so sometimes people ask us, Hey, I'm having a lot of fun making videos! But how do I get more people to watch my stuff on YouTube? Hm, great question. And honestly ... I have no idea. We're just making this up as we go along. But, I mean, there are some things I guess you could maybe try if you wanted to get popular on YouTube. Since popularity is the ultimate goal of life, right? Anyways, here are some tips for getting popular on this here YouTube. JOSH (BORED VOICE): How to improve your thumbnails. Thumbnails are so important to your success on YouTube. And that's why it's imperative to make them as misleading as possible. Look, bottom line, you're probably just making videos like this one where you're talking in front of a camera, right? I mean, who's got the budget for much else? Obviously, there's only so much you can do with your thumbnail to make it exciting. I mean, you can just take a screenshot and then add the title, but how boring is that? What I suggest is that you make your thumbnail very misleading. And here's the best way to do that. How do I say this? Girls have these parts of their bodies, obviously, that when featured in your thumbnail ... make idiots click on them. And these idiots are a very lucrative demographic that you totally want hanging out in your comments section. Hey, where's the babe from the thumbnail? Did I miss it? Let me just scroll through again. (LAUGHS) They do wonders for your watch times. Oh, and speaking of your watch times, JOSH (BORED VOICE): How long to make your videos. Nowadays, YouTube is more likely to recommend videos with longer durations. So make your videos as long as possible, obviously. If you have 2 minutes worth of content, there's no reason you cannot stretch that out to 10, 20, maybe even 30 minutes. Plus, if you followed my advice about thumbnails, people will stick around just to ... see if anything gets interesting eventually. Come on! (CRICKETS CHIRPING) It's gotta be here somewhere. JOSH (BORED VOICE): How to create captivating video titles. First off, all caps. That's a must. It needs to be clickbaity too. The less information you give about the subject of the video, the better. I mean, if you'd explain what the video is about, you're basically giving the whole video away. So like with this video, a boring title would be, oh, say, "How to Get Popular on YouTube". Like, it's too on the nose. It's basically a spoiler. Why does the title of this video accurately represent what the video is about? That's boring. It's like I've already watched the video before I've even seen it. Give me a break. A better title for this video would be something like, say ... (DISTORTED VOICE) Are your thumbnails too racy? Something like that that gets people's attention more because people are dumb. They're attracted to the pretty, capitalized letters and the urgency of the multiple question marks. Plus the word "racy." I mean, I don't even need to explain why that's gold. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) JOSH (BORED VOICE): How to hook your audience. The first 15 seconds of your video needs to be really compelling. If you don't hook people quick, they're gonna leave you forever and they will never come back. - You have one chance. (GIGGLES)
- (BELL RINGING) If you mess up the first 15 seconds of your video, then you really might as well just shut down your whole YouTube channel. Like, that's basically what it boils down to. So here are some ways to make those first 15 seconds really shine. Yelling. (SCREAMS) Hey everyone, what's going on? It's Jordan. Saying something outlandish. Theory: Spider-Man is the grandmother of Tony Stark. Let's talk about that. Making a weird noise and then talking about how weird that was that you just made that weird noise. (HUMMING) (LAUGHS) Why did I just make that noise? Eh, I'll probably leave it in. Hey guys, what's up? It's Jordan. Oh, that's so quirky! You're so quirky and fun! JOSH (BORED VOICE): How to get collaborations. Collaborations are easy, especially when you're just getting started. All you've gotta do is live in the same city as another YouTuber, become friends with that YouTuber, and then convince that YouTuber to put you in one of their videos. I promise this works 100% of the time. Oh my goodness, my favorite YouTuber! I can't believe I ran into you here at this coffee shop that I know you come to often because of your Instagram account! (LAUGHS) (SNIFFS) What— What was the last time you showered? Oh, I've ... I've been here a while. Waiting. Hey, listen, I have a YouTube channel too! All right, but all joking aside, guys ... don't worry about being popular on YouTube, okay? See, when people ask us, Hey, I'm having a lot of fun making videos! But— No! Stop right there! You're having fun making videos? Perfect! Don't worry about getting popular. Just ... do what you love. Find something you enjoy and just do it. Don't worry about getting popular or making sure you're doing all the right things to get your videos seen. Life is too short to worry about doing something popular. Instead ... do something good. Theory: Spider-Man is the grandmother of Tony Spark. Let's think about it. - (JOSH LAUGHS) Tony Stark. (LAUGHS)
- JORDAN: Stark. I said Spark. I need to sit down. I don't even know who these people are. - (JOSH LAUGHING)
- JORDAN: Um, who is it? Spider-Man and Tony Stark? - JOSH: Save that for bloopers.
- (JORDAN LAUGHING) - JOSH: Jordan doesn't know who Iron Man is.
- JORDAN: I don't even know who that is. - (BOTH LAUGHING)
- JORDAN: Oh ...
