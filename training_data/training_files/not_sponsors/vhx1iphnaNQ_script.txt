we are gonna have a lot of fun today ladies and gentlemen it's time for another build at home stream I'm excited because this is the kind of build that I personally just get kind of extra amped for I love compact builds I'm one of those people who's like oh yeah like that's kind of a cool computer oh it's small oh wow that's a really cool computer I sure do like you know seeing so much performance in something so small it makes me feel not so insignificant and inadequate myself wow we're good good things really do come in small packages ladies and gentleman so that's what that's what I'm that's what I'm pretty into seeing today and this is designed to be kind of like well this sort of inspired by a build that we had planned to do a long time ago Jake and I were talking about how actually oh yeah you know I think he's pretty I think he's pretty public about it hopefully it's chill Jake and I were talking about how we should do the divorced parents build because we've both you know how about I'll say this we've both had some experience in our lives whether it's personally or or friends see now I have disclosed absolutely nothing about anyone other than myself we both have experience with what it's like to have two homes which is obviously better than no homes you know like it's not like I ever felt you know not loved or anything like that but it did mean that you know sometimes I wanted to play on my Super Nintendo which was at my dad's house and I was at my mom's house and so you know I couldn't play on my Super Nintendo that's the kind of that's the struggle right so this is this is the computer that those with divorced parents can take with them all right so I'm going to run you guys through the parts list here actually something I've got to do real quick is fire up my my twitch chat as well so I can see all the all the fool that's life that's live productions for you all the chats including the twitch chat awkward alright cool so there because our twitch chat' now as well really cool ham I'm gonna just switch cameras here so we're not going full-bore on the specs this is an RT X 2070 super but this is not exactly going to be an inexpensive machine since one of the goals was to have it be like a really really high performance gaming rig in in a tiny case so the idea here is that you guys could follow along with you know more more down-to-earth hardware and it would be all the same steps but it's just you would swap this out for you know a 20 60 super is like a really good middle ground in terms of price to performance right now and this is obviously a super get it super overbuilt 20 70 so we're going with that motherboard is another part that I look at and I go yeah we could we could have really gone with something a little lower price than that so this is an x5 70 IRS Pro Wi-Fi I mean unless you're you're overclocking you know you're there's really no like performance benefit to going with a super high-end motherboard you might get some extra features that you may or may not need we're gonna find out as we make our way through this build if we're gonna need any of these features but there you have it we're using a high-end board anyway what else we got going on here cooling we're going with the Noctua Nhu 12 escrow max black so this is the LTTE edition basically it's just a really good air cooler and it's black so it'll look really nice we've got a windowed case so that is worth the extra like 10 bucks to me personally we're going with a 700 watt power supply overkill again we could easily get away with a 500 or 600 watt but power supply is one of those things that it's just it's it's the kind of thing that you cheap out on a couple times in your life and then you just you don't cheap out on it anymore the case is one that I'm really stoked on so this is the tu 150 from Lee and Lee and what's special about it is of course just listen to that isn't that gorgeous Oh that hen I absolutely love it so that's what makes this thing portable because obviously I mean any computer if you're if you're man enough is it's portable right oh why is this not working there we go any computers portable right you just you pick it up and move it around no problem about a handle that makes it like easily portable so I'm super amped on that naturally we've gone AMD for our machine so we've got a 3800 X here and then for RAM we actually went super over spec on that as well I mean it's not wrong to go with thirty-six hundred megahertz CL 14 memory but these tried and Zinio RGB sticks from g.skill are you know they're past the point of diminishing returns a little bit you know you could go 3200 CL 16 and you'd probably play your you know your valor inch or whatever the games the kids are playing these days just fine for the SSD we've got an MP 600 gen 4 PCI Express SSD from Corsair no particular reason that we chose this one other than that it was it was on the shelf that was it was there it was convenient I mean there's there's not really a clear performance benefit to going with one a Gen 4 SSD versus a high performance Gen 3 SSD and even as we showed in a recent video if all you're doing is gaming there's actually just not much benefit to even going in via me in terms of things you would notice like game load times so you know what just get the SSD that you feel like looks nice and has a good warranty has a good reputation for reliability I'd say that's far more important than the like the FPS you imagine that you're gonna get from upgrading your SSD so as usual we're gonna start with B okay tech flexor 1 337 I love your question over on floatplane so I'm gonna answer it asks how Genki is the table set up this time oh I'm so glad you asked check this out check this out so this is one of those like I don't wanna see the wrong brand yeah lifetime time brand tables from Costco and because the computer is so small we actually had it one notch lower when I started this and that was a lot more stable but I was really worried about the framing of the video because like you guys could basically see down to my junk line and that was where you were gonna have to look the whole time to watch me build the PC and so I was like oh is there another notch on this thing because it it really didn't look like there was another not and it turns out there was but it is not real stable it's just gonna make for a bit more of a comfortable viewing experience so I opted to go that route in terms of motherboard accessories that we're gonna need the only thing that might come in handy for us here is I'm gonna this you know what I think it's a range issue yeah it is - all right trying to change my scenes the one thing we might need is this thermal pad that might come in handy for our SSD if we end up having to strip the outer parts off of it it's possible - that this SSD does not have an OS pre-loaded on it in which case I'm just gonna end up swapping it out for something that already has an OS anyway so that we can fire the machine up let's go ahead and start loading things onto our motherboard then we'll take a quick tour of our board this is about as over-the-top as it gets for a mini ITX AMD board again it's just the kind of thing that makes me real happy just seeing this much performance in this small of a space so I lied on the last one of these streams that I did I said that a soos I had heard had some kind of like patent on built-in i/o shields I was completely wrong obviously some of you corrected me in the comments but here you go here's an on Asus board that has that feature let's go ahead and have a look at what else we've got super beefy VRMs with does this have active cooling on the VR ends as well no I don't actually see a fan in there it's just got a really big heatsink on it eight pin power connector right up here we've got active cooling though this is great so we've got active cooling for both the chips and our nvme m2 SSD over here only two memory slots that's something that you're gonna run into with basically any ITX board and then other than that it's just loaded up so here's our onboard audio here's our PCI Express 16x slot will use that for a graphics card let's see yeah there's another m2 slot on the back so we've actually got two of those over here on the front we've got four SATA USB three front panel audio excuse me front panel USB front panel connectors front panel audio is over there got our 24-pin connector like basically every every square centimeter of this board is loaded up with something let's do our CPU installation first here now oh man see it's hard to kind of it's hard to classify this build because it's not the best value thing ever because we went kind of over the top on the power supply and motherboard but it's also not just completely ridiculous either so for CPU we went with our reisen 730 800 X so you know that's that's not crazytown we're not going like 12 cores or 16 cores or anything totally nutty like that but eight high-performance cores pretty much all that you would need for the vast majority of your gaming or even mid-range content creation needs I don't know why I switched back to this angles because we're gonna go ahead and install this in the socket right now where's my little triangle I don't know where AMD gets off making the track the golden triangle even smaller than like ever before these days alright let's go ahead and line that up by the way another thing that someone jumped in and corrected me on on our last stream was the orientation of the text I was like hey look they always put the socket on the motherboard the same way why don't they just make it so the text is right-side up when you hold the motherboard right side up and they were like um actually the text is right-side up relative to the socket so there you go now we know isn't that fun let's go ahead and lower that arm and get that processor installed there you know that's the thing is no matter how long I spend doing this stuff I never stop learning which is what makes it fun I mean if there was nothing left to learn and there is nothing new then how would you stay passionate about it that's the greatest thing about technology isn't it it's great there's always something fun and for you to try and yes this memory is 3,600 CL 14 that is contributing a significant amount of our budget and like I said before is not necessarily something that I would recommend all right so we're gonna go ahead and get that installed angle to this is unlikely to get in our way so I am gonna go ahead and put it in now oh that's interesting you don't actually see that very often on consumer boards anymore tabs on both sides of the memory slot all right so these only go in one way naturally but I'm one of those and one of those Dass Oh over on floatplanes says thinking of a similar available for 3900 X for my CAD work one thing I would ask you if you're going to build a machine that is for you know doing serious work and it's gonna be heavily loaded a lot of the time is do you really need it to be that small because there's two things that you compromise when you go small actually a whole number of things you compromise when you go small you compromise your future expansion let's say that you were to come across you know some who knows an accelerator card that you need or or something along those lines all of a sudden you know that that new technology that comes now let's say five years from now again you've got some AI accelerator card that you want to add to your system you're not gonna have an available expansion slot for it the other thing is noise no matter how hard we try we're never going to be able to make a small form-factor machine quite as quiet as a larger machine can be because you can get those nice large low rpm fans you can get those nice big pumps you could have multiple pumps and turn the RPM way down basically the lower you turn everything the quieter it's going to be even if you have to add more of them in order to get the cooling capacity that you need so you're gonna give up some noise and from my experience although I will say this is mostly geared towards laptops the reliability of super compact machines has not generally been as good as when the manufacturers give themselves a little bit more room to to work with I I'm trying to get the wifey's attention oh wait I thought I needed thermal compound but I actually realized that I do not in fact need thermal compound because it should be in the box for my cooler if you guys ordered one of the crow max black air coolers that knocked to a recently released if you ordered one right out of the gate you would have actually been treated to one of these this is an LT T edition of it and I really I'm having a hard time with my switcher here hello there it is alright cool no we got no technical issues on this stream today ladies and gentlemen oh yeah you would have been treated to an LT T edition it's basically the same as the regular one except there's an LT T logo there there's an LT T logo there see if there's any other differences I don't know if this orange accent is on the box for the non ltte edition oh yeah it says Linus tech tips edition includes extra orange anti-vibration pads and I think I might have spoiled the surprise a little bit because that's basically it it includes some orange pads now the good news is that it didn't actually cost any extra this was just a deal that we worked out with Knoxville ruse said like look we love your products and we want to do like you want to work together not to it doesn't really do like traditional marketing so basically we put together this plan where we were like okay let's do an LTE edition but let's not make it like let's treat it more like you guys are doing you know marketing with us rather than we markup the product and we take like the extra profit let's just kind of do it more like a marketing exercise let's launch it together because I've been asking them for so long for a black heatsink version of their products so basically you just get the orange things you get this I don't even know why I'm promoting this right now because it's not like you can buy one now you get this little card look at that it's all silvery and fun partnerships in the PC industry this is my it was my little letter that I wrote okay to include in the box partnerships on the PC industry develop in many ways sometimes through doing business together sometimes as friends and sometimes simply out of respect it's the last one that led to the product you're holding in your hands today oh wow really excited I've always had the deepest respect for a knock - his unwavering dedication to ease-of-use quality and performance I'm not I'm just not a big fan of their original color scheme so with that in mind I'm incredibly excited to be partnering with them to launch the crow max black versions of some of their most legendary coolers I know you'll love them as much as I do little thing and look it's even like signed but that's fake that's fake it's a printed signature sorry sorry to ruin the illusion here guys it's a printed signature apparently they still have a few of the LTTE editions on eBay I actually did not know that and I can't verify that but Samuel over on floatplane chat went ahead and threw that in the chat there so maybe they held a few of them in reserve I know the plan was for them to just it wasn't priced higher they just sold the first I forget how many it was but it was some some thousands of units the first ones went out with the the cool packaging and then they just kind of replaced it with the regular ones after the fact all right wow I really hope this fits in here if Jake boned me on another khufu not fitting Jake put together the parts list for this one I really hope that if this doesn't fit I have some kind of alternative here let's go ahead and we're gonna do a quick test because if I have to have Mateus like jump in the work truck and head over here with another cooler now is the time to do it not not when I actually really really need to install the cooler I'm gonna be honest with you guys I'm not 100% sure how to take the side okay and that's apparently how you do it you just pop it off you got those little those little poppers let's see if I can get you a look at that yeah there you go we got those like nipple things that go into the little housing thing thing MIDI dad's right let's drop that down there okay please tell me this is going to fit oh that actually looks quite promising okay I think we're good I think we're good what do you think guys does that look like it's gonna fit yeah looks pretty good to me looks pretty good to me all right I've got I've got high hopes I've got high hopes we're not gonna we're not gonna drop my TS aligned just yet let's go ahead and throw it on the motherboard then one of my favorite things about knocked to his coolers it's like yeah performance that's important but it's also not necessarily the only important thing they're mounting mechanism is just awesome it's just simple you know all you need is these top oh wait oh we're on AMD I am less familiar with their AMD mounting mechanism doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo manual time look in my defense for a lot of years the AMD mounting mechanism was not super relevant okay here we go AMD mounting mechanism hey there you got your your AMD mounting bars you've got your 4 NM whatever you got your 4 grey spacers 4 a.m. 4 and then they've got white spacers for aim these other sockets alright and then you need your 4 nm a LS 1 screws alright so we're gonna assume that that's all this stuff right here we just don't need the well I'm not really white and more like a cream cream-colored spacer apparently we have love hugs knocked to his website to death sorry Noctua you know love you fam but you guys got to get a better website because this happens every bloody time we show to out on stream your your site goes down and then and then customers can't buy your cool stuff and there's nothing I can really do about that you just got a you got to embrace you got to embrace the bad things and and learn from them and change you gotta get a better website it's okay don't worry they're they're you know they're mechanical and thermal engineers not look P gotta say it fell over they're not you know website engineers so you can't really hold it against them too hard alright take it kind Caban Chabad been Quebec kebab ingenuous over on floatplane says hey Linus what kind of cooler would you recommend for a CPU around 300 Watts and air conditioner hooked up to a chilled water loop that would be my ideal and failing that I guess you could go with custom water cooling that would be that would be your best bet right about there all right let's have a look here so we need whoops I'm just kind of guessing here I didn't really look very carefully at the instructions so I think you just put the I think you just put the little plastic things on top of the little nipples from the stock backplate alright then I think you just pop this bad boy right on top and we want the number four yep for for a m4 I'm getting I'm guessing I'm guessing that's got to be it that's like exactly knocked to a-type thinking right there can't just put a m4 on it but you don't call it you know one and two cuz there's only you know two sets of holes right you call it four and three for like you know a m4 and a m3 or less that's my guess yep yeah grins and them still with me grins and smiles i huh how to pronounce you guys user names you guys are killing me here you got to get easier to pronounce user names all you there we go alright that's pretty straightforward one thing that kind of blows about AMD having a rectangular socket arrangement for our mounting hole arrangement for their socket is that it doesn't give you as much flexibility when you're building to decide which way you want your cooler oriented and they they have an opportunity here where they made the like small change for a m4 like it wasn't a huge change they just moved the holes a little bit they had an opportunity to just make a big change like if you're gonna kill compatibility anyway why not just kill it you know for reals and then give us a square pattern so that we have a choice for how we want to mail out our coolers I would in a perfect world I'd love to see AMD and Intel both just used the same whole patterns but I don't think that will ever happen I couldn't imagine them coordinating I mean for a little while there they were at least using the same naming schemes for their sockets AMD jumped in with their x3 99 kind of cutting off Intel's flexibility in terms of naming their future sockets without making them sound like you know an old AMD one let's go ahead and get our thermal compound on some people pointed out that I did not put thermal compound on the build last time around that was because I was using a stock cooler and I didn't need it so here I'm gonna put with an AMD CPU we're gonna put kind of like a bigger glob than we would on an Intel one just because they are physically a little bit larger and because they use Chiclets some of the dies are actually quite spread out under there unlike an Intel chip where you know everything you have to cool is actually in this little tiny contact patch right here that field Jenny J says until has a patent on square mounting holes I sincerely I sincerely doubt that I mean honestly speaking nothing would surprise me that much when it comes to just nonsense that's patented but I I really doubt that one Hey - did you hear anything from thermos - no I don't well ok Alex would be the person to ask about that because he was the one who worked with them on that project but as far as I know we don't really have any kind of update for you guys I mean the thing is like we don't mind showing off a prototype product like that when it's just got some really cool engineering behind it and there's no sales pitch like they weren't pitching like hey you know back our Kickstarter because that's where we start to get a little bit uncomfortable like when we're selling you guys something based on claims that we can't verify but if they're just like hey yeah we've got some really cool engineering and we're work this thing and we want to show like our cool engineering we did we're a lot more comfortable with that so that's why we were willing to do a video about that product even though there was no hint of availability we got burned not doing enough due diligence on the kalos fanless case that was an example of a time when we were representing something as a product that was going to come to market because as far as we could tell it was and then it never ended up coming to market but they actually did take money from people so we learned our lesson from that and with the thermo siphon we were just like yeah okay we're not gonna we're not gonna sell it but we're gonna say hey here's this prototype and it's super cool and if you guys ever have a finished product we'd love to do a review of it but that was that was all that we were really comfortable doing all right let's go ahead and get this cooler installed so again it's so it's so beautifully simple there you go you just line up the screws with those pegs so simple and you can't have one because their sites down I don't know why everyone goes to their site anyway are you going to knock to his web sites go to like you know the oh the paid link in our video description man affiliate rates are taking a beating as part of the coronavirus fallout like to be clear I ain't complaining at least I'm not in the oil business you guys had your eye on that over the last little bit it's crazy it's crazy was it a couple days ago oil dipped below free like you had to pay to get rid of your oil it's nuts it's madness but this is you know it's obviously having an effect on our business as well I don't think anyone's coming out of this coronavirus thing completely unscathed I mean even you know zoom look at zoom so yeah they got a big uplift in in people you know interested in their product and using their product but then they cut some really negative PR out of it because all of a sudden everyone's using their product and there's a bunch of security vulnerabilities that are coming to light and all that kind of stuff so it's like it's having some kind of negative effect on basically everybody yeah - what's que master yeah - $30 for a barrel of oil I had a Johnno from my team he messages me that day he's like yellow Linus you want to get into the oil storage business maybe we could set aside some space in the warehouse just keep some barrels of oil in there I'm like Chuck nope if we're talking like storing you know lithium lithium batteries you know whoa no now you might have my attention but uh yeah well man I don't think it's ever coming back the way it was I like to be clear I expect it to get better than it is right now you know once people are driving a stuff honestly it's been it's been crazy like being in almost almost complete self isolation like I've gone out to go shopping and like I go out on bike rides as long as I'm maintaining my social distancing and all that good stuff but I've been to the office like even though I've been symptom free for quite some time I've only ended up going to the office a couple times over the last little bit because I've had someone in my house or other I think there was like two colds in my house basically when this thing started and they've been kind of like passed around so right now a couple of my kids are coughing so I'm sitting here going well okay there are certain things I need to go into the office to do so I went in to film like a couple of tech quickies but like I walked in everyone gave me like a 5 meter radius fill my things and then left so I've only been to the office a couple times in the last like month like I've been working at home for a month now and it's crazy I get behind the wheel of my car and I'm like wow I don't miss this at all I'm actually kind of concerned my volt has had the same gas in it for like I already only fill my tank once every month or two cuz I do most of my driving on electric so it's got like two month old gas in it I'm gonna have to throw some fuel stabilizer in there it's got like a full tank of gas which on the Volt is not a ton of gas but it doesn't matter how much it is if you've got expired you know stale gas in your tank you're gonna have a real super bad time Oh preg says that if the cooler fits the case before installing the GPU that's a that's a darn good point why don't we go ahead and do a quick sanity check here all right what angle on my ass fine you guys can kind of see what I'm doing here go ahead and pop this up so what we're what we're hoping is that this you know what I think we're good I actually think we're good because this looks like a 140 millimeter fan mount so let's go ahead and pop that on there if it was a 120 I think we'd be in trouble but the fact that it's a 140 means we've got an extra 2 centimeters and this is only a 120 mil cooler and there you go you got your little heat pipe knobblies sticking out of the top there and that's where you sometimes run into trouble with cases with a rear 120mm fan where they try and keep it as as slim as possible but I think I think we're gonna be good here hold on I just gotta get this power cord out of my way there we go all right quick test fit time oh yeah oh yeah we're good we got tons of room in there all right all good good work Jake I knew you had my back I never doubted never doubted for a moment it's not like there's gonna be a live evidence that I doubted you for a moment that doesn't exist oh one more thing we can do before going any further is let's go ahead and get that and to drive installed now one thing that's a little bit tricky actually is oh here I'm gonna toss this down since I'm done with it if I do end up needing to throw a different MDOT 2 in here because this one doesn't have an OS on it I don't know if I'm gonna have access to that to that mount on the back oh you know what I think I actually might even oh that would be super cool if this had a big enough like CPU opening to install an MDOT - ooh that is really really close I'm not sure I guess we're gonna find out oh that is super close here I'll try and get you guys a better look at that so you can see here there's the the mounting slot for it there you go that's a better angle there's the mounting slot for it so I might be able to kind of slip a drive in there it's one that doesn't have a heatsink on it so it's a little bit easier to mount and then that screw is gonna be like right there like I could take it out but if I drop it down there it's gonna be kind of a pain in the butt to get out and stuff so we'll cross that bridge when we get to it I guess awesome well now we're pretty much oh right no I need to go ahead and actually do the thing that I had just said I was gonna do let's get our drive installed oh you know what I kind of like this better without the case back there taking up all my taking up all my frame and stuff there we go all right I'd really wanted to have the webcam again so that I could get close-ups with that just kind of handheld but I'm not gonna drop anything Matthew tech guy some tech guy you are don't even know that I never drop stuff and YouTube chat moves so fast I just can't even when I'm looking over at it I just I can't even Avery says do heatsinks matter for him to drive so that is a wonderful wonderful excellent question there is some debate as to how much they matter as to whether they matter and I think everyone agrees they don't matter much so in cases where you're MDOT to is super overheated like you're you're putting it under a lot of strain and it has basically no air flow you can actually experience throttling from the controller so there's there's two main components to well three main components to an MDOT to SSB there's the controller there's the DRAM cache and then there's the NAND flash so the controller is kind of like you could think of it as the CPU of the MDOT to drive and that can experience thermal throttling so that you want to make sure is cooled well enough adhi Ram cache that also doesn't want to be any hotter than it has to be I don't know that there's any real evidence that it can thermal throttle and affect performance because the only way for your DRAM to be too hot would be for your controller to also be too hot because you're in a in a no airflow situation but but I mean obviously DRAM doesn't doesn't want to be any hotter than it absolutely has to be so the where you really run into trouble then is when you don't have the mounting screw for your comes out - sorry I'm trying to talk through the components of and I'm about to drive while also looking for my mounting hardware that I need it's fine I'll borrow the one from the back right so the last main component is the NAND flash so you've got your processor you've got the cache for the processor and then you've got the flash which is actually the mass storage so you could think of an m2 SSD as kind of like a mini computer in a certain way you know you've got your CPU you've got your RAM which the CPU stores has frequently used information in and then you've got your storage which would be your hard drive or your SSD well this is kind of like a mini mini computer so the NAND flash actually does not benefit from cooling and if you cool it too much it can negatively impact its life cycle so you need to find this it's not about you know is it good - cool your m2 SSD it's about sort of how much should you cool your m2 SSD because if you do it too much it can have a negative impact and if you do it not enough then it can also have a negative impact so I would say that you know whatever the cooling that it ships with is probably the correct cooling to use for it all right so let's go ahead and get this puppy mounted I think this might end up being a little bit tricky sometimes it can be sort of more of a pain in the butt than not for manufacturers to ship these giant heat sinks on them so we just go ahead and pop that in there I'm not sure how well you guys can see that this is one of those situations where I wish I have that alternate angle but then I'm gonna take this little tiny screw that I borrowed from the back and then I'm gonna have to borrow a screw from my test bench motherboard which is I'm a dresser in my bedroom if I end up having to put a different SSD in here then you go ahead and put this here and that looks like it is not going to go down so what I'm kind of curious about I wonder if I could just lay it on top basically is it gonna grab II now we get the heatsink and the fan it's not gonna be too much cooling see this is what I was just talking about yeah I don't think that's gonna fit anyway okay fine well here's our problem we can't get rid of the fan like I can't just take this off and not mount it and go oh well you know what this has got a big heat sink on it so I don't really need the cooling fan anyway because that cooling fan is cooling more than just the SSD the motherboard chipset is in there and x57 he really does benefit from active cooling and then I can't easily get rid of this so you know what I think I'm gonna do I'm gonna take I'm gonna take a very short break and I'm just gonna run and get that Drive I'm just trying to remember where it is I'm having a bit of a panic moment here where is that Drive okay run away maybe I can oh you know what I'm gonna grab a like a chat comment or something to talk to you guys about that's the fan wrong side a CPU cooler yes you're right not necessarily wrong side but I do need to reorient it it's got to go the other way so that it's exhausting out the case I did notice that don't worry I got this let's see any good questions here [Music] Tom's ook he says Danube our come to the conclusion that x5 suddeniy doesn't actually need the active cooling I believe I did see Roman do some investigation their thing is the kind of validation that they do on something like a CPU or a chipset at the manufacturer level is not like hey is this gonna work for a year or two years or three years it's like hey we took a hundred of these or a thousand of these and we ran them in an artificially stressed like thermally stressful situation we kept track of the rate at which they failed over time and we have determined that you know this is this is the temperature that it needs to run at in order to achieve you know this mean time between failure is a very different type of validation so Roman is probably right that your motherboard will probably be fine if you don't have any active cooling on the chipset but he does not necessarily have all of the context that the manufacturer would have for in a sample size of a thousand or ten thousand what the real failure rates might look like over three five ten fifteen years so this is one of those things where enthusiasts will tend to come up with their own answers to questions like how much voltage is safe for a core i7 4770k and in general that answer might be just fine for you the other enthusiasts who realistically is going to pass that computer along to a friend or a little sibling after two to three years anyway but the manufacturers have a reason for having the answers that they do and I tend to trust the engineering that's done by companies like AMD or Intel over sort of enthusiasts to general wisdom even if it is from someone as knowledgeable as Roman and as methodical as Roman so there that's my take on that if every x5 70 motherboard has active cooling on it you know it's not like AMD gigabyte a seuss MSI it's not like these guys are idiots it's not like they don't know that consumers prefer passive cooling solutions like we got away from active cooling solutions 15 years ago there's a reason for it nobody liked it these little fans have a tendency to fail they're the loudest part of a system there's a reason we didn't we didn't want that so if they're bringing it back my my best assumption is that we are doing that for a reason and not for for lulz there that's my take on that oh I think a couple people are confused by who I mean by Roman so Roman is the real name of deir bauer so he's a german over extreme overclocker tinkerer enthusiast extraordinary he's also quite active on YouTube hi can I help you I would love to have food but I am building a computer right now and people get mad when I eat on stream so it's like I'll just I'll just starve I will starve from my art alright let's go ahead and prep the case oh I almost forgot there so I think what I want to do is I'm gonna go yeah we're just gonna be lazy and we're gonna go this side I had thought I might turn it around and have it pull air through the heatsink just cuz that's a little bit easier to clean I always recommend a pull configuration when you can just cuz here I'll show you guys what I mean so here's our heat sink here's the back of the case right if we have our fan mounted here and we're pushing through it that tends to be where the dust accumulates on the surface where the air comes through it so now if I want to clean my heat sink I have to take off my fan clean it put my fan back on if I mount it here pulling air through well then I just get the cat hair off my heat sink throw it in the garbage and I actually do nothing else so that that's why I tend to prefer that but I'm being lazy right now that is the only reason that I'm mounting this in push because I am doing a do as I say not as I do moment alright that's on there pretty good making sure that spins wow they really did nail the spacing on this board look at that memory module I don't know if you guys can tell but that is right next to that fan there's like maybe a millimeter I think there's I think it's a full millimeter in between this fan and this memory module it's beautiful it's beautiful I love it tough YouTube chats like eat eat you too skinny no no no it's fine it's fine it's fine I got this I got this it's all good just throw my extra accessories here I'm practicing some of what I preach today whenever you've got extra stuff when you're building a system just go ahead and throw it in there Oh thought I saw someone asking oh hey what SSD did you end up putting in there it's just one of Sabourin rocket PCIe gen3 ones I it's just the one that I have on my test bench cuz they shipped us a bunch of them and they're like four terabytes which is super handy because it means I can have all of my test applications and all that good stuff on there no oh one small oversight this is something that I feel like Mac people rightly mock as PC people for just the way that inter compatibility between all our different Hardware leads to just dumb stuff like completely inactive ports on our computers so this case has a USB type-c front port here and it's got that newfangled USB type-c internal connector and it's not it's not a Type C it's this this guy right here this connector right here and unfortunately my motherboard doesn't have one of these oh man oh well not the end of the world it still got a couple USB threes it's just kind of lame just a little lame alright power supply time would you run the course or one without a heatsink with the active cooling yes I could it would just take longer and then I would have to put it back together when I'm done to return it to inventory and that would be just sort of 15 minutes of my life that I would never get back disassembling and then reassembling that heatsink on that SSD I wish I had I wish I had a you know a cooler sexier answer to the heck question but that really is the real reason indeed 260 says would you consider this a good time to build a PC or a laptop I am so glad you asked that because we've actually got a video coming very soon exploring weather right now is an amazing time to buy a laptop because it might just be between AMD just launching risin 4000 which I hate calling it because it's desktop rise in 3000 it's Zen too but they've just moved a generation ahead on mobile because branding so between AMD launching Zen 2 on mobile maybe that's what I'll just call it and Nvidia launching their new super mobile graphics cards there is a just a ton of mobile performance out there for very reasonable prices like we've got a video coming on an RT X 2060 equipped gaming laptop and I mean the new 2060 so super weird get it they launched their their 2070 super so that is actually like a a different branding on the GPU than their 2070 and then they launched a new 2060 but they're not calling it super it's almost like they don't want you to think it's too good or something but it's actually faster than the old 2060 so anyway and and it's cheaper so the new 2060 is faster and cheaper so you can get 2060 equipped gaming laptops for like a thousand US dollars which it's still a lot of money to be very clear but it's that's a lot of that's a lot of gaming for a thousand bucks in a mobile system like that's the thing you guys got to remember is mobile used to be just incredibly expensive and performance that sucked and that whole paradigm has shifted so much over the last few years like realistically ever since Nvidia launched their 900 series mobile where it was basically just desktop parts and laptops the game changed still expensive but at least the performance is there now like going back really far you know like 70 900 series mobile cards is bad like they were they were slow like a 7900 was like a you know a 7600 desktop part you know and sold for well like top-tier top-tier top-tier price levels alright so here's where we're installing our SFX L power supply modular interface I'm doing the intake on the bottom just because there is a little bit of space on the top we technically could have an intake there but I really I really don't see any purpose to doing that the front tell how about that that's that's nice well we're just gonna put that aside for now and then I'm just gonna screw that in from the back J chem I just bought a laptop for portability and now I have nowhere to take it yeah I know right so yeah it's obviously a first-world problem but it's like still kind of a downer an 800 matt says when is our TX 3000 coming do you think you know I try not to participate too much in the whole rumor mill when is the next part coming my general approach is unless we've got some really solid like hardware leaks so unless you know all of a sudden there's pictures of boards that tells you it's it's like weeks away usually or at the most like a month or two unless we're there I tend to kind of go you know what buy what you can afford you know buy whatever price point it is you were looking at get the best thing that you can for that price and don't you stress too much about that that's that's kind of my approach like if we're real close yeah don't be it don't be dumb you know make sure you're getting the most for your money but everyone wants to have the best crystal ball and at the end of the day you know crystal balls still still just balls you know all right we're gonna go ahead and plug in our rear power we're gonna flip that on now actually we're not gonna yes we don't flip that on now cuz I'm not gonna plug it into the wall anyway so you can see this case has that kind of passed through power so you've got your plug in from the back and then there's an AC power cord that runs through a channel up here over to here that's how we actually get power to the power supply even though it's like a mid mount an internal mount alright how simple power supplies in now we can go ahead and throw yeah let's throw the motherboard in I'm gonna attempt a standing up install so that you guys can see it a little bit better look at what hardware we got in here new channel - beard tips oh I'm not in a position to give any tips on beards I'm a beard no beard novice I'm still learning the ways of the beard I'm still not a hundred percent on keeping it though I and that's not to like fish for compliments I have definitely gotten enough compliments on the beard I get it I get it you guys like it I'm just not a hundred percent cuz my kids don't really like it that much they say daddy is scratchy so that's a that's a fair point you know you can't really argue with that priorities right alright let's go ahead and pop this in here so something you guys may or may not have noticed about this case is it's actually DTX so it's a little bit on the bigger side compared to some ITX cases because it's got three slots down here so DT X and other boards can have up to two PCI Express slots on them but as far as I know I'm just trying to think there's not too many dt x boards in general but some of them anyway don't even bother putting both slots on they just use the extra board space to you know put more components onto the onto the PCB because you're not gonna be able to install more than one graphics card in it anyway cuz they're all dual slot these days but what this would theoretically allow for is a dt x board with the 16x slot on the bottom you could have your dual slot cooler they're pulling fresh air in from this vented bottom and then you could actually have a second card installed in the top for like high-speed networking or like a VR wireless adapter or something along those lines I've actually got yet another upgrade to my living room VR setup planned I know I know I said last time you know this was the upgrade but may have been wrong I I might be I might be going at it again just because I've found myself a little bit limited by ITX I just there's a few things there's actually a handful of things that I want to put in it I want to have the option to at least tool around with wireless VR if I want so I would need to be able to put in a card for that I want to be able to put high-speed networking into it if I want not I you know I might not bother with the high speed networking especially because two-and-a-half gig is going to come soon enough on motherboards that are at price points that make any sense but the big one is that I've been having a lot of issues with full body tracking in VR and so the way full body tracking works is you've got your headset that tracks your head are you like okay so the way full body block tracking works is you're trying to replace your or you're trying to put a virtual camera into the into the VR environment and then you're trying to have an avatar that represents your body and where it is and how it's moving so it's really easy to do your hands and your head because you're holding these controllers and you're wearing a headset and these things are all tracked but if you only track your hands in your head then the bottom of the body you like it can move around and you've probably seen this if you've ever played a game in VR where you move around and like looked down like the legs just kind of like like they kind of just move around kind of weirdly right it's not natural so if you want natural movement you need at least three more trackers you need one on your on your like hips on your back like it's somewhere between hips and waist like it's right right kind of there and the small your back and then you need to on your feet because as long as your as your avatar is built correctly like anatomically correctly however your feet move it will bend the joints in such a way that that's where your foot could be if your hip was also here like it gives it enough information and I've had a really hard time getting full-body tracking working and a lot of the troubleshooting steps that I have found seem to suggest that the vive tracker 2.0 that I have have trouble with certain like trying different USB ports or different chipsets might help and I found information that seems to suggest that as media chipsets don't do very well with these trackers but I haven't found anything about AMD chipsets because it hasn't been until the last you know really six months that an AMD processor has been the ideal choice for VR gaming so there's just not a lot of information and there's it's already like a niche within a niche right you know VR is a niche and then people who are interested in full-body tracking is Aneesh and then you've got a third niche you know people who upgrade their computers frequently enough that they've done it in the last six months and then you've got a fourth niche AMD gamers so you've got this like this ven guys Venn diagrams are these vents Urkel's and you've got this like tiny overlap in the middle and it's like me so I can't find this information to determine if it's the USB controller and it's not convenient for me to swap out the motherboard to find out if that's going to make it work so I'd love to have the flexibility to be able to just throw a USB controller card in the thing and try that as a solution to why my trackers are kind of drifting around I'm starting to think that it's that that's not the solution anyway though just because I moved the I used USB extensions to move the receivers a little bit closer to where I typically stand and the drifting is still there but it's gotten a little bit better which seems to suggest to me that it's more about the lighthouses being able to see the trackers without any occlusion like you know an elbow in the way of the hip one or whatever else the case may be and less of an issue of communication between the tracker dongles and the USB ports so unfortunately um extra lighthouses have been out of stock for weeks from valve and so I've just been kind of in limbo on that project which I've really wanted to do because it's it's fun I enjoy streaming VR and but I don't like setting up the camera in my living room just because it's a hassle I've only got the one webcam at home and I always have to drag it upstairs for LAN show so that Luke has a video feed of me in addition to the video feed that I'm broadcasting and then I take it downstairs and set it up and run it it's kind of hard to get it the USB ports behind my TV and the cables not long enough to run to the front blah blah blah blah blah so it's just it's just kind of a hassle and I'd really like to be able to just use live and full-body tracking Kai Hong 10 says Linus when you're gonna stream VR badminton I did see that game that would actually be kind of fun because I have a half-court space in my garage that actually I even put down lines for and everything so if I moved actually oh so I reached out to valve to get more lighthouses when they arrived maybe I could set up a temporary play space in my garage and play that VR badminton game I heard it's terrible like just abominable apparently no matter how big your play space is it still kind of dynamically scales the court as you're moving and it's like super weird so you like you might mess up your muscle memory and stuff and from watching some gameplay of it it really does not seem designed for advanced players at all so I my hopes my hopes are not I'm not high whatsoever AM 800 matt says do you think a 970 can handle VR or any games at high preset well yeah of course it depends right like you go back and you look at reviews of of the 970 when it launched I'm sure they were running plenty of games at high preset they're just games from back then right and I mean these days so many new games even are designed to run on older hardware like look at valor --nt it's not like it's particularly demanding sorry I should be showing you guys what I'm doing I'm wiring up the power supply here so I put in our 24 pin I actually connected that to the motherboard already I took our so we've got an 8 and 8 so these are 2 6 plus 2 PCI Express connectors on that it's really hard for you guys to see I'm sorry yeah there we go so I've got 2 6 plus 2 PCI Express connectors so those are wired into another one of the modular ports on my power supply and then the last one I think the last one I'm going to need right here is a 4 plus 4 so that's going to handle our 8-pin connector on the motherboard I'm just gonna go ahead and plunk that in up there here we go modular power supply that's really not necessary it's just a nice to have go ahead yeah yeah really wish I had done this earlier I was not that easy to get it but hey it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't a little bit challenging right the biggest thing valor n't demands is kernel access mr. MacGuffin over on the flow plane yeah I know right well and that's the thing about anti-cheat it's like yeah it's it's all pretty intrusive you know if it's not intrusive to your computer it's intrusive to like just your life in general it's annoying yeah I don't have a good response to that I have not actually played the game I'm sure it's fun I've I've seen some of the guys at work Colton's been playing it basically constantly as far as I can tell I'm not sure when you get to do work done that's the thing about work from home you know I can't make sure they're not all just playing valiant all day Colton are you playing Valerie right now yeah Colton are ya he's not I'm sure he's not he was getting me the Amazon and Newegg paid links for the description of this video oh shoot that's not how I should have done this I should be using the cable management holes guys gotta use my cable management holes what am I crazy all right here we go well that's okay cuz I've already got it plugged into the motherboard which is the hard part so I'm just gonna pass this through this is one of my tricks that I often use on build guides where I'm where I have like a lot of time to think about how I'm going to structure the video instead of just doing it live is I'll plug the modular cables into the motherboard first and then I will run them to the power supply after the fact because it actually is a little bit easier to get at the power supply in some cases in this case it's especially easy it's like right here alright so there you go there's our there's our 24 pin there's our 8 pin there's our dual 8 pins our more different pins you know might put like one cable tie there just kind of tie that up ding are we close I'm gonna do our front panel connectors here all right so let's do our USB 3 not USB 3.1 you know type-c just the regular USB 3 I guess you're gonna oh you know what I could do here's an idea oh I'm just gonna put this up here hey there we go we're trying to look at the bottom of the case a little bit easier gotta be real careful with that front USB 3 connector those pins are super fragile so give it like a really gentle little wiggle to make sure it's in the right spot and then then press down otherwise you can you can mash those pins in there and let me tell you it is not a lot of fun to bend them back I guess I will just leave my type-c USB connector hidden back here will not be needing that unfortunately front panel audio I'm not sure if this is gonna be long enough so front panel audio is traditionally over on the bottom left edge of the board looks like we're gonna be good yeah no problem easy peasy that's a really straightforward build so far that's okay no there's plenty of time for things to go wrong oh all right cool hey there we go from panel connectors I hope they're labeled it drives me absolutely nuts when they're not labeled on the board cuz there's just no reason for it and they're not labeled on the board in fairness they're color-coded so as long as I can remember what gigabytes color coding is that helps a little bit but you're already silk-screening the board so why not just silkscreen that in fairness to them there's really not a lot of room on this PCB okay I'm just gonna guess what do I have I've got power switch and reset switch on that today all right well power is usually red and there's no way Green is power so let's go ahead and plug reset into that Oh interesting apparently this case does not have a power led huh how about that it also doesn't come with any additional cooling fans now that's a bit of a concern given that we're gonna have a 2070 super in here hmm I wonder if I could track down some kind of cooling fan from one of the other builds that we've got planned normally at the office that wouldn't be a problem at all all right maybe I'll just grab something from chat to respond to and then I'll head down there and see if I can find a fan what do we got here Earl Jones says hello all right there's no way for me to reply to that really I've got links in the YouTube and twitch pages of all the parts that I'm using are sorry twitch a floatplane and YouTube have links ah Charles so has given the chance what would you have changed part wise in the piece of your building right now I mean if I was trying to make it more value conscious I'd go for a B 450 motherboard I'd probably go for some cheaper memory I'd probably downgrade the power supply a little bit there's so much room in this case look at all this room like we're gonna throw a graphic card in here but you got all this room hanging around here so I might just go with a non modular power supply since it doesn't really make a difference to performance I could probably save my I could without giving up much performance like almost anything measurable I could probably save myself a good couple hundred bucks on this but it wouldn't be quite as you know like baller awesome of a machine so it's not as much fun to build on the channel so that's always the kind of the weird balance we're trying to strike right is we want to show you guys stuff that actually makes sense to buy but a lot of the time people won't watch it if it's not like really cool and you know you know matte black PCB and you know RGB lighting and all of that stuff so there's no way to please everybody cuz we'd love to just build totally practical in the Toyota Carolla gaming machines all the time that people can go and you know you know from a business standpoint even use our use our affiliate links and you know we get additional revenue from that and all that good stuff like if you guys don't buy the stuff we link to there's a there's actually a business effect that that has on us but obviously the most important thing is that we want people to want to watch the content so yeah it's tough it's tough we're always we're always struggling to try to find the best possible balance there I'm Way out in the garage and I really really sincerely hope that you guys have an audio feed for me but there's no guarantee of that whatsoever right now hey the good news though as I found a cooling pair nice this is actually for the next build stream that I have planned or it may be the next next one I've got two more that I've got already in the queue right now cuz honestly these are kind of fun for me just going through building the computer hanging out on stream so the one of the next is that okay thank you thank you cannon autofocus got a had our little square on my face there for a second jeepers what was I talking about house though that was a little awkward alright yeah so the one that I've got planned next is it's gonna be the oh right my VR rig upgrade so I'm gonna go em ATX so basically the same specs that I'm already running but more but more expansion and I'm gonna be water cooling it at the same time and then the other one that I've got planned is actually finally an upgrade for our editors workstations so they've been running core i7 6950 X's I want to say for almost three years now which is kind of crazy to think about for two reasons like one you know how you know how well those have kept up for three years and then to how quickly they've been overtaken in last year so it's time for us to upgrade those we're gonna be going with 24 core thread rippers which they are gonna be pretty stoked on I think we're going with 128 gigs of ram per station as well so that's going to be flippin awesome and I'm gonna be building the first one of those on stream so that'll be fun all right so we've got options here I can either throw an exhaust in the back or I can throw an intake in the front and the way that I would lean on a build like this is I would throw an intake on the front that's going to give me positive pressure inside with a filtered intake which means that I'm gonna have less dust buildup on the inside of my case now if I was to use this machine for something that I would use it for this is the perfect form factor in fact I had originally intended to use this to upgrade the VR machine and it wasn't until recently that I decided that I wanted to go em ATX that I just made this like I just kind of random portable gaming PC build and for my application I would especially go with front intake because the bottom so see this vented bottom that we got here right there in my media console I've actually got two fans installed right under where that would be and they're filtered fans that are installed in the cabinet themselves on the underside so I would have filtered intake on the bottom I would have filtered intake on the front and then I would have really positive air pressure inside to keep dust from creeping into other places so that would be the the way that I would set it up let's go ahead and get this puppy installed let's see if there's any any good messages in chat off man it's the rain just like not quite enough for me to do it okay there we go what do we got here well Dennis build his own PC again can't wait to see him struggle I don't know I mean it was real hard to watch when we did the remote control human project using the fpv goggles I think Anthony's instructions could have been better I think Dennis got shafted a little bit on that like I think I think if both Anthony and I if you know to eliminate variables if we could have both used the same test subject which we couldn't because they would have learned from the first time around I think I could have beat him with Dennis against him with Dennis oh but also Dennis absolutely contributed to their team failure there so I don't know a an 800 Nats asks our mobile downloads coming to floatplane soon I have no idea that is actually not a feature that we've gotten a ton of requests for so I don't know how high of a priority that is for Luke and his team over there I know this is a brown fan and I know I talked about how awesome it is that naktu has got like black fans now and stuff and it's like super cool but look look look look there and it's black so you got this or nevermind that there's a window on this case we just need to make sure that we never look at it from like right from the side right as long as we look at it kind of from there it's still black it's all good tighten mechanism says nope I entirely blame Dennis Yvonne did a great job she really did she really did she's a rock star I remember she used to get kind of upset back in the day when people would make comments like like on moving vlog or something they'd be like yeah you can tell that's one of businesses going down when the boss brings the wife to work and she's bossing everyone around like people clearly didn't realize that Yvonne was not a nepotism hire she ended up working for the company just because she wanted to keep her own job she ended up working for the company just because she's so useful and she's so good at doing stuff and she has worked for the company from day zero like from Dade negative numbers Yvonne has been shooting Linus tech tips videos since before Luke ever joined Lana's tech tips you know going back to ones from like eight nine ten years ago she's the one operating the camera in some of those cases especially when I'm shooting at home like it's not like I could hold it myself alright what else we got here oh my goodness is so the light Simon Says male to female ratio of LTT I'm just trying to remember I think Sarah's passed her probation so we've got oh man just trying to remember we've got so many people working at the company now that like I kind of have to stop and think about it we have at least four women just trying to remember their points we have one that we're kind of in the process of hiring but it's sort of stalled because she's overseas so I don't know like where that's at but ones that are actually on the roster right now we've got four out of three so about 10% I will tell you that that's not a great ratio from like a you know Justin Trudeau government standpoint but it is more than representative of the percentage of female applicants that we get so there's like kind of a limit to what we can do there I know it's for women out of 30 so it's about a 1 to 6 about a 1 to 6 ratio if I'm doing the math correctly is that it oh right graphics cars almost forgot the best part here we go all right 2070 super time ladies and gentlemen looks like there's a bit of a trick to getting the PCI slots uncovered on this case we're just gonna go ahead and ah thumb screws that come so tight from the factory that you can't um do them like what's the point so we're gonna pop this off we're gonna go ahead and undo the top two spots here one other cool thing about a DTX case like this is even if you're using an ITX board you can actually install up to a triple slot graphics card those are out there so something like a triple slot graphics card with a couple of slim fans in the bottom of this case or in a configuration like mine where I've got those external fans that are gonna blow air up through the bottom of it would mean basically zero compromise this is gonna fit zero compromises on cooling holy banana sacs if this doesn't fit I wasn't even worried about the GPU oh man oh man wait hey for it okay I might need to pull the fan out of the front there that's what I'm jammed on right now oh boy ooh boy hold on wait wait for it oh yes okay that was really close this is ridiculous okay my audio cable is kind of getting in the way there okay that's fine okay oh that was a tight fit the entire bottom of the case is pretty much graphics card that's it ridiculous uh okay well that I had options I had options wasn't even that bad wasn't that bad I could have pulled this fan that would have made it a little bit easier I could have pulled the heatsink that would have given me a little bit room to a little bit more room to stand angle it in there we got it though we got it it's all good jeez oh okay I love that I love you know I love to have a little bit of stress in my life you know like what would life be without a little bit of stress keep your heart pumping yeah oops huh I slipped okay it's a minor slip all right now I get to put that little cover dude out in there nice um how does this go in wait I thought this was on the outside oh boy was this supposed to go in from the inside oh I don't think that's going in wait can't he do all he can yes he can no problem ladies and gentlemen I am so hungry she bring us this plate all right some of you who aren't here that face tracking thing good I don't know how often that's coming up but nothing I can do about it right now I don't think Yvonne comes up earlier offering me lunch and it's like meatballs and gravy and stuff I'm like yes yes I would love to eat that's all I can think about this whole time I've been streaming now all right we're gonna go ahead and tuck that cable right over there out of the way go ahead and tuck this extra extra links graphics card cable down there yeah we barely even have to do any cable management in this thing got like three cables this is great there we go nice nice real nice look at that portable a lot of extra space in there definitely could have gone with like front 120-millimeter AIO that could have been done pretty easily or like our rear 140 for the for the cpu and like a front 120 for the GPU you could probably get away with something like that in here if you're willing to work for it a little bit but look at that basically no cable management required that is one of the nice things about a modular power supply for sure now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to clear up some of this stuff and then maybe we should maybe we should fire this puppy up shall we mmm they say I actually did not think of this before the stream and I really should have because last time I ran into exactly the same problem I do not have a particularly convenient way to hook up a monitor to it and show you guys what I'm seeing let me give it a little bit of fuss I've got SDI capture over there I've got HDMI capture over there but the HDMI feed is coming from that camera this does not have SDI out so I couldn't sacrifice that camera to this unless because that camera also has an SDI output I switched which capture card i was using eliminated the color correction profile that i'm using on that one because that one i have in like a rec 709 profile that doesn't need OBS color correction and then I could go HDMI into this and then I could kind of look at my monitor on my computer over there and use it like that hey hey we got a plan ladies and gentlemen let's do it okay so you're gonna you're gonna feel a slight you're gonna feel a slight pinch here oh no no no no no no okay hold on a second no because that will kill our audio because I'm using the audio into that camera over HDMI and the AVI oh my my SDI one does not support that but new plan okay new plan it's okay we've got this we've got this I've got an HDMI cable here okay and I'm gonna plug that in here we go hey kiddo what's up can you help well you I don't know if you could help in the useful sense of the word but you could be you could be present and perhaps okay hold on a second I need to give the people an update real quick here okay I also have an avi Oh 4k so if what I do is I plug into this and then just kind of run this over here and then kill the AVI OSD I okay thing but it it's very exciting it's very exciting I assure you then what we're gonna do is we're gonna plug this into ah yes I came up with something that you can do do you want to wait nope nevermind I don't need that done okay so I've got power bar on this C stand for the camera over here so I'm just gonna run to that that's powering this camera that we will no longer need okay there we go so there you go see I've got it all just kind of plugged in off-camera I'd love to show you guys you know the pretty side of the machine while it runs but you know life doesn't always work out that way you're out here upside down there you go there so there's our machine and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna see if it just fires up for us what are the odds what are the odds that it's gonna just like magically oh no no no no oh good it's plastic okay I thought there was something under there it was gonna scratch the finish to the top of the cave that would have oh that would have been an instant regret what are the odds that this is just gonna fire up well we can't reach the power button so that's um a downer there we go okay give me one second darling I need to add a seen video capture device add create new AV io 4k alright what are the odds oh let's hope for the best here if I was plugged into a monitor I would be able to know for sure you know why I'm not getting a signal the fact that I'm going through a capture card means that I kind of have to guess so I could be not getting us eight or I could just be totally totally getting a signal how about that okay I think I might have screwed something up here though you know 4k on this one there we go Hey look at that oh man what a pro what a pro this guy is okay uh yes I do have a job for you my child see this blue cable right here that is an Ethernet cable it's plugged into the back of your computer in your room can you unplug it and bring me the end of it thank you sir darling can you go in the door or out the door because I need to close this door what no no you can come in or go out you just can't stand right in the doorway because I need to go get a keyboard and mouse ah let's squeeze through here ah yes okay so I'm gonna grab the keyboard and mouse from my server room here serve your closet nice oh man we are problem-solvers today uh no I actually can't help you that's sort of the way it works when you asked if you can help me is you're the one doing the helping I need you to I need you to unplug that thing and then bring it here okay well I think you got it sorted out right did you get it from out from under the sandbag apparently my my fetch quest for him was one of those and I'm just trying to think of a game that's like that where you get like a seemingly totally simple quest and then like it turns out there's all these hoops you have to jump through there was a sandbag on the ethernet cable apparently thank you good sir what a fantastic help you have been legitimately legitimately not like the kind of helper your kids are like oh can I help make breakfast and you're like oh gee I was kind of hungry and really wanted to eat but sure I guess you can help make breakfast not that kind the other kind all right keyboard yes so once again any experiences that I'm having on this computer are going to be through a capture card in a window on a monitor on my monitor are over in that corner so I'm not I'm gonna try not to judge it - harshly but oh hold on a second let me just try to think what kind of pain I might have on this one is that it I'm adding it okay how about how about that well not start it I actually can't even tell from here if it's asking for a pin or a password is there anything yeah can you check does it say pin or password it says password no no no no no no no no that's fine I don't want the hint okay cool it says welcome all right we got this okay cool nice is it the yes or the no on the left there and that blue thing yeah yeah but on the right but is it is the yes the one on the left or the right yes yes it's on the left all right I got this all right cool yes yes we are in business and the system just booted right up like what are the odds two streams in a row the system's just fire up apparently you guys can see the hint anyway all right good stuff yeah yeah I'm good I'm good for now well yeah I'm trying I'm trying it's just that this is this is a little challenging okay I have a really tough task for you no wait this is too tough this is too tough of a task no no it's fine I I don't think you're gonna be able to do it okay so we need to go over to our PC build b-roll scene we need to add a new video capture device existing avi o 4k blue hey there we go nice okay cool so now my a scene is this my PC is this alright I might even be able to read that from over here okay this was a bigot I don't the store's opening it how's the store keep opening this was a big advantage to doing this on the TV last time around was I was actually able to see what I'm doing all right so that's that's kind of usable let's go ahead turn my mouse sensitivity down a little bit ah all right nice uh what do you guys want to do okay I'm gonna go - I'm gonna go to floatplane chat first here uh ask for water bottle from LTTE store calm Oh bright Nick actually message me or lose like hey did you a pimple TT store.com yet I was like no I actually didn't you might pass me my phone please he's probably got like you know something that's back in stock or like some kind of some kind of promo we're do or something like that but I'm supposed to tell you guys about I've got Brian the electrician two-month-old gas is fine haha I oh I know that the issue is that under normal circumstances I burn through the gas in my volt once every one to two months the way I'm driving right now it could take six months I'm well aware well aware all right let's have a look here oh no all he said was LT t sir calm oh he did send me a message earlier that apparently we're gonna do a sample of a pink and white bought water bottle to see if it looks any good in the meantime though we've got our regular water bottles actually here do you want mine throwing me that water bottle I can show the peeps it's on the table there where I'm pointing follow my finger see my finger follow it to where it goes hey there it is nice just don't unplug any of those cables because we've got a very precarious situation going on over here is there water in there by any chance I am so thirsty thank you alright good helping so LTT Starcom get your own water bottles so you have nice and you know clean water cold afterward I was looking for it not clean cold if you put dirty water into this water bottle it'll stay dirty but it'll also stay cool alright so what you guys want um okay so the kids vote for game what do you guys vote for okay everyone everyone on stream is voting for voting for something else here alright I want both kids - close your eyes for a minute okay both of you have to close your eyes all right all right here you go you weirdos don't know both my kids close your eyes uh-oh look at that no no both my kids close your eyes see it's fake its fake its fake there's nothing in there everybody just chill okay you're good you're good you're good okay we got people asking for Minecraft RTX Oh unfortunately that's going to be far too much of a hassle to set up right now so I was running Minecraft r-tx on my son's machine wait was i running it on I was running it on my VR rig I brought it up from downstairs because my son's machine has a 5,700 XT why don't we start by just getting logged into steam here and then we'll go from there I'm just gonna type in my lap hopefully that is the right the right password I don't know if I can actually remember very well I kind of wish I had me in a little corner on that one but I have to go back over there and set it up all right yeah yeah my password is all Allstars yeah you guys got me you got me all right let's see how well this machine runs oh man this is really tough I can't really talk to you guys you know what we're just we're just going for it we're just switching to screen cap here so I had some requests for apex is apex actually installed on here sir is there anything on the desktop that says a text widget that's okay that's that's Lightroom so we could do that but we won't let's go ahead and close that okay you guys got a pick stuff that's actually installed on here you nerds you're killing me here oh no I'm not I'm not calling you guys nerds I'm talking to the people who are watching at home is this a No we can fire up a No hey there it is all right you know what we're firing up the a no I'm just gonna pick my own stuff cuz you guys are you guys are killing me here shout out the Tomb Raider yeah see a man after my own heart alright we're going with a No while I wait for you play to do it's annoying garbage let's go ahead and get the panels installed on this case because that's what you get to do once it actually boots up do I want to allow the app to make changes so this is really important when you install this panel on the back you're gonna want to make sure the perforations are over by your power supplies exhaust if anyone's actually still trying to follow along with building the computer instead of just straight memeing which seems to be what this stream has turned into at this point all right there we go so pop that on windowed side panel I want to throw this on just cuz I want to get some idea what our thermals are looking like um yeah it's gotta be this way it's gonna be right there we go nice and then I'm gonna put this front panel on everything's upside-down for me cuz I've got the system mounted upside down but minor details next time I'm gonna think of this you know what if I actually decide to turn the computer on we gotta peel that's an appealing proposition does anyone want to help me peel this plastic oh hold on well we're gonna let we're gonna let her help because you already got to help okay come on over here darlin okay so I'm gonna hold this in place and you've got to peel this plastic off can you do that good helping it's pretty tough isn't it you two hands go for it you got this pretty tough isn't it are you strong enough okay hold on she's pretty hard okay go ahead hey you go well I could do that yes nice thank you good helping okay oh there we go we get signal um yes is on the left right okay is the game launching or what oh man oh man I'm just trying to remember don't even bother emailing this email address by the way guys I get so much spam that it's like not even funny trust me I will not see your email and I'm definitely going to set that up as soon as I'm done with this because now you all know that that's not on there what update available I don't want a man no I don't date Y so this is what happens the instant you try and do something live it's the worst it's the worst all right I should probably go through a couple super chats front fan what are you talking about is it not spinning great spinning are you guys talking about fan fan fan are you talking about fan not working fan is totally working so I will explain that to you guys here come on the type of fan that I'm using is this is one of Noctua zen ff12 and it's got these little like airflow channel ii doodads over here so check this out see that fan is absolutely spinning these are just to help the airflow kind of like go like in like like a vortex away from the fan it makes them better for like directed airflow it's actually a reasonably common feature I wouldn't I don't want to say common but it's it's not unique to those fans Silverstone's air penetrators have something similar and there's there's other ones as well so yes that fan is definitely working I did not forget to plug it in it's all good damn y'all got bamned alright yes again how many times do you need permission to I'm just trying to play my game like guys this is PC gaming okay in the 21st century it's like it's painful what is it even doing right now I can't even tell directx end-user runtime so good I was hoping to have the right number of DirectX end-user runtimes I just want to know if this thing works well alright viewer activity let's go through this do some super chats here right bang there's a lot of super chats you guys are super there's too many I can't read them all sorry sorry in advance to everyone who's super chat I don't read oh man I'm just trying to maximize this window and it is it is hurting my poor laptop okay thanks Kevin it you sent the first Super chat of the stream Magnus first says pump to see the bill I use the exact same case last week I found a 20 ATT IOC gets very hot though with the glass next to it yes I would I would think so what you could do to deal with that though is you could add a slim you could add something like a slim exotic on the bottom or a couple of them and then you'd be forcing a just a ton of air flow into that graphics card and also a ton of air into the case and it would allow it to have positive pressure and kind of passively exhaust so that would be that would be pretty sweet I had a couple bunch of super chats about no audio yes yes we got that sorted out a couple hours ago um Michael says where would you recommend someone who wants to learn about hardware in PC building really do for real right now Oh what else have you got Gordon McPherson okay in all seriousness though there's lots of good written sites as well - excerpts form great place to go heading out and start learning just ask questions there's no dumb questions just dumb people Gordon McPherson that motherboards awesome no complaints - Landy me is awesome in the backgrounds really good all right good to know Gordon so at least I know that you know I can recommend it with a straight face so that's good oh one thing we actually haven't done yet is even set the XMP profile oh well I think it's that should have sort of sailed at this point Tommy Gunn says may I ask what happened to the LTTE minecraft server you were building a render server in its case please explain ah excellent question so that server worked really well and was superfast but the problem is that most most data centers don't let you just send your own Rando hardware into them so we weren't able to find one that was willing to allow us to have that machine be the actual server so we ended up just paying for a normal hosting so we tore down that machine and we decided to reuse it for a render server where it will actually be deployed for our workflow at the office because it's like I don't know 30 40 % faster than our old machine or something stupid like that what else we got here Mike says can you make a web developer build video sure go buy a Mac I heard that developers I love them I mean beyond that just like a high-performance machine with like lots of monitors is kind of what you're looking for Chris says yo can you do a server build with products from Alibaba I mean hey that's that's an idea that's it's something I never looked into server parts on Alibaba I would have to do a little bit more exploration James G says I'll donate ten more if you drop something I'm sure I dropped something at some point in the in the stream so you owe me ten bucks falen says any reason why you opted for the gigabyte X 570 over other options I like about just curious well there there ITX X 570 is excellent like good mix of features reasonable price for X 570 I mean X 570 the only real benefit of it is PCIe gen 4 which right now doesn't have a clear benefit and I mean outside of some like data-centric GPU applications which let's face it you're not doing that on here and then like multi-gpu which again has no benefit for an ITX build our James says thanks for being you thanks for being you James infinity tech no the beard probably isn't going to stay in the very long term what do you think kiddo should I keep the beer - no maybe well you got to provide your rationale you can't just say maybe and leave everybody hanging like that no then well that that changed in a hurry yeah yeah I'll I'll deal with the game later that's ok they they like watching that game thing there I'm just doing my my super chats I have it says speaking of the volt when are we getting more car tech videos soon so if you're not subscribed already go subscribe to short circuit I'm gonna have a video up coming wow I just almost leaked an NDA product I'm gonna have a video there and it will contain some teasers for more car content Oh how's closed Donovan says I have 99 hundred K and 2080 Ti and in in 1000 D is it we're throwing in a mini ITX for the heck of it well you already apparently have too much money to spend and so sure why not I mean really it's down to you Donovan if you need another machine then I guess so personally I would prefer a smaller main rig and then a small secondary rig that I could then separate if I wanted to or I could just stack them on top of each other if I wanted to Coolermaster actually did a kind of similar concept to that super dumb case I forget what it was called it was like some half series Coolermaster half xb was that the one where it had like no that wasn't the one that was there their air 540 clone a half man what was it stacker ITX Oh was it the half 915 R yeah that thing was super dumb um yeah sorry I can't screen share with you guys right now but here's hardware connects video about it they do such a good job of their case videos here's two ads on the hardware connects video about ok forget it I'm not going to bother then but yeah it was like a main case and then you could have like an ass like in like a super skinny one at the bottom and then like your stream machine at the top or something and so you could have up to three of them really bizarre Eddie says I have a risin 7 ought to be 450 with an Archie X 2070 and my idle temps are 120 to 130 and my gaming temps are 150 170 what are we talking Fahrenheit Eddie from New York or are we talking like your temp sensors are broken because your system wouldn't be on if your attempts were that high and we're talking Celsius yeah sorry that's a great question to post on the forum though people would be able to answer that for you right quick fast my CAD foot thank you mister fats Thank You Daniel alright can you tell me if my PC specs are ok for high level gaming also if it pairs well with an alienware 34 inch curved gaming monitor well Daniel if you had actually sent your PC specs that would be a little bit easier again once again though you can post on the forum that'll get that all sorted out for you alright just gonna do a couple more Peter D says thanks - you look like Peter Schnabel I have no idea who Peter Schnabel is but I will take that as a compliment and oh man this is like some kind of Russian script or something so I'm sorry I don't know your name but what happened with your home setup did you keep the server with the vm's and optical hubs I did keep the optical hubs but I still I have my regular machines in that closet now I said in that video that like the virtualization in one room splitting out to everywhere is like highly experimental and it was it was a little temperamental we got it working long enough for the video but it's not the kind of thing that I would daily drive what I do intend to do though at some point is move my VR set up which is downstairs upstairs so we've already got the dual DisplayPort optical connections running through the walls I just want to tidy up that a little bit I want to get that dead squirrel out of the crawlspace I'm actually gonna have someone come in and give me a quote on redoing the insulation in my attic cuz it's really really bad I thought about doing it myself but I kind of want to do spray foam but then that's like really expensive and if you do it yourself wrong you can have all kinds of like off gassing and it's like poisonous or something so what I'll probably end up doing is blown cellulose but then by the time I go and rent the machine compared to just having someone come and do it for me and like learning how to use it I'm kind of sitting there going I think my time would be better spent doing some other improvements in the Attic including redoing cable management getting all those optical runs getting a couple of new Ethernet runs I want one over to my kids room and then I can do that while they're working on that and then my whole attic crawlspace will be beautiful and perfect and immaculate and yeah I think that's probably the route I'm gonna go yes my darling what can I do for you oh I shouldn't have brought that up well there's a dead squirrel in the crawlspace in her house why well because it crawled in there and died I honestly don't know how it died maybe it just lost a little live yeah maybe it just didn't want to just didn't want to be alive anymore maybe I died of old age or maybe it got in a fight with a porcupine and it lost that's true but the porcupine if it won well it's not dead so it could have left right just processing that one well I don't know maybe they wanted a nice warm place to fight well I don't know I mean I'm just guessing all I know is that there's a dead squirrel everything else we're just guessing it all right cool it's people are typing F but I'm not sure if they're just talking about a conversation with my daughter or if they're talking about just yeah everything all right um cool and I think that's gonna be it for a super job so let's go ahead and see if this thing actually runs games wait the game is the game gone gone for 15 minutes what the what the heck what is this what's going on here what happened is it launching now all right there we go we got this no problem ah quickly adjust my audio what what you talking about Willis okay yeah yeah that's just game stuff okay cool Oh darlin you're not gonna be able to use that thing right now because I'm using that computer to stream right now so if you are talking into the microphone on it and playing around with audio effects then it would probably not be that great oh it's ff4 respects for the dead squirrel yes yes I actually don't know if that made it into the video wait what is this what am I looking at did I accidentally click something what is it what what is this oh wait is it pressing escape is restarting whatever this is I have no idea what I'm looking at you guys what is this timing info oh I accidentally launched the benchmark well there's your problem oh well I mean I guess that's fine we're running a benchmark okay I you know it's funny like you I play this game all the time but because it's a game I actually play rather than one that I just used to test computers it never even occurred to me to fire up the benchmark for it all right cool well I don't have a hardware info running in the background so that might be a good idea let's just go ahead and do that we've already heated it up a little bit do I have hardware info on here please tell me I do please tell me it's a shortcut on the desktop I don't see it huh hey there we are yes nice run yeah I think that's right nice what does that say is there something about updates don't care about that right now all right cool so let's run that benchmark then oh no no that's no good that's not what I want ah so is it gonna default to the benchmark again I think so neat well that all worked out just peachy didn't it I can actually comment on yeah I can actually comment on acoustics a little bit here though so that's interesting hmm this might be a little bit no I'm representative because we've got these intake fans on the GPU down here that are able to pull this nice fresh air without any restriction so maybe we should try to flip over the system while we run in here overall it is nice and quiet I have no idea what settings this benchmark is running out by the way guys so like we're all just we're all just experimenting right now wait oh it manages to not launch the benchmark this time course not alright Oh fine yeah that's my save game that I've been using this is the limit I don't care about that I just fire up if I just want to like run a game for a little bit look guys I never claimed to be good at this stuff okay alright I'm just making it up as I go look there's no like class for how to be a professional youtuber alright maybe there is but I didn't take it obviously if I don't know it exists I couldn't possibly have taken it right alright how's our house are you coming to me doing kiddo do we have money that's one this one are we making money are we losing money we're losing money okay that's a bummer oh alright do we have awesome ships maybe we could just go to war don't start uh start a good old-fashioned war or these warships do they look like warships to you yeah alright let's go uh oh boy I really can't see very well alright let's go fire the let's go fire the cannons you know I had some people kind of hating on me for using this game as like a performance benchmark at some point you know it's pretty demanding actually I've seen a little bit of chugging on the twenty seventy super but I've enabled an extra option in the game that allows you to zoom out more so you're usually locked to like around this view which I find very restrictive and it allows me to zoom out way more which makes it a little bit easier to plan out your islands and stuff like that but also makes it so that it rubs a little harder wait is my ship dying yeah oh well why didn't you say something oh man well now what wait are they all gone well that was quick rip that ship yeah yeah yeah I guess it doesn't really matter yeah that's okay well there you go guys that's it definitely a little louder but wow it's a lot quieter than my current stream machine fortunately I'm gonna be going water cooling on that so not worried about that Wow yeah that's one advantage to going with an overkill power supply the fans not even spinning even though we're gaming on this thing right now love it alright well thank you guys very much for tuning into the stream today hope you guys enjoyed it and holy I just realized I never told you about our sponsors for the video today derp so this video is brought to you by master op RF drop column excuse me the mast drop in San Heiser PC 37 X gaming headset great bet for a fantastic gaming headset it's got angled drivers and an open back design the drivers come from the same family as the HD 600 series of headphones so that means great stereo imaging and locational accuracy comes with a noise cancelling microphone they've sold over 40,000 of these things they're just a fantastic option for an audiophile grade headset and new users over on drop comm are gonna get $20 off their purchase if it's over 50 bucks so you can find the link to that in the video description and the videos also brought to you by thermal grizzly thermal Grizzlies conduct or not liquid metal thermal interface material offers maximum cooling performance for your PC we even use it in a phone once wouldn't recommend that and also make sure you don't use too much but when you apply it right yes it's absolutely fantastic it's like nothing else so we're gonna have that linked in the video description as well hopefully both of those sponsors forgive me for burying their reads an hour and 45 minutes into a video that's okay they're both you know good guys I'm
