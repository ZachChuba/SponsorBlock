hi guys Jade here so during my physics degree something that I really loved was the problem-solving aspect but you know I never really felt like I was a particularly strong problem solver so it's a skill I've always wanted to get better at so I thought today we could do something a bit different and try and train our problem-solving skills a bit with three logic brain teasers they're all related and kind of build upon each other I would encourage you to try each one yourself before we go through the solution together because that's where you're going to learn the most and also we are going to have the most fun but anyway let's see how far we get and get started you're visiting an island and on this island there are only two types of people Knights who always tell the truth and knaves who always lie you come across two Islanders Billy and bulk you ask Billy is Bob and knave instead of telling you the answer he whispers it to Bob this is weird and even a bit annoying but hey you're the visitor so you just go with it so you asked Bob did Billy whisper the answer yes and Bob replies no so which of the following options must be true one Billy is a knight too Billy is a knave three Bob is a knight and for Bob is a knave if you want to try and solve this for yourself first this would be a good time to pause the video how did you go so the first thing I would do is consider all the possibilities there are really only four both Billy and Bob and knights both Billy and Bob and knaves Billy is a knight and Bob is a knave and that Billy is a knave and Bob is a knight so let's test out the first situation in which both billion Bob and Knights so when you ask Billy is Bob and knave Billy knows that bob is a knight and because knights always tell the truth Billy would say no so then when you ask Bob did Billy whisper the answer yes because Bob is also a knight and he never lies he would say no so the scenario in which both Billy and Bob and nights is perfectly plausible okay so now let's try the second scenario that both Billy and Bob and knaves so when you ask Billy is Bob and knave the truth is that Bob is a knave so because Billy is also a knave and always lies he would say no so then when you ask Bob did Billy whisper the answer yes Bob who always lies would say yes so then this scenario isn't consistent with what happens because Bob answered no ok so let's consider a third scenario that Billy is a knight and Bob is a knave when you ask Billy is Bob and knave the truth is that Bob is a knave so Billy being a knight would say yes so when you ask Bob did Billy whisper the answer yes Bob being a knave who always lies would say no this scenario is consistent with what happened so it's perfectly plausible that Billy is a knight and Bob is a knave so now let's try the final scenario that Billy is a knave and Bob is a knight you ask Billy is Bob and knave and the truth is no so then Billy being a knave says yes so then when you ask Bob did Billy whisper the answer yes Bob who is a knight would say yes so this scenario isn't consistent with what actually happened so if we look at the two possible scenarios the thing that they have in common is that Billy is a knight therefore option 1 Billy is a knight must be true so that was the warm-up this next one is a bit harder but hey that just means we'll feel extra smart when we solve it you come across 11 Islanders in a line while you don't know anything about the first person in line you know of their remaining Islanders five of them in nights and five of them and knaves you ask the first person if I asked you if you were a knight what would you say instead of responding they whisper their response to the person behind them this you think to yourself you asked the second person in line was the thing you had just whispered yes instead of responding they whisper their response to the person behind them you don't know why but you ask the third person in line was the thing you would just whispered yes instead of responding they whisper their response to the person behind them this continues until the last person who when asked was the thing you had just whispered yes responds yes is the first person in line and night or a knave pause the video now if you would like to try it for yourself so when I first saw this question I didn't really know where to start it felt a bit overwhelming because it seems like there's so much that you don't know you know that there are five nights and five names but you don't know what order they're in so it's like how do you even begin to go about answering whether the first day is a night or a knave but instead of getting overwhelmed and focusing on what we don't know let's try focusing on what we do know and see if we can figure anything else out so we know that there are five nights and five naves and we know that nights always tell the truth and naves always lie now we can't just brute force it like we did in our last example because there's just too many factors and plus that's not really in the spirit of problem-solving so let's test out a few different ways that Knights and knaves might interact and see if we can find any patterns that might help us so let's take an extreme case and imagine that all of the Islanders and Knights so if you ask the first person if I asked if you were a knight what would you say well because knights always tell the truth he would say yes so then when you ask the second guy was the thing you had just whispered yes he would say yes as well if you ask the third guy he would also say yes this would continue until the eleventh guy who when you asked was the thing you would just whispered yes would reply yes so it seems like knights always propagate the same answer this is a pattern even if it's quite simple and boring knights always propagate the same and so now let's take the other extreme and imagine that all eleven Islanders and knaves so when you ask the first guy if I asked if you were a knight what would you say well if you straight-up asked him are you a knight he would say yes because knaves always lie so when you ask him if I asked if you were a knight what would you say well the truth is that he would say yes and because knaves always lie he says no so then when you ask the next guy was the thing you had just whispered yes because he's a knave and knaves always lie he answers yes then when you ask the third guy he lies and says no are you seeing the pattern when we asked the fourth guy he lies and says yes so it seems like the pattern is that knaves flipped the answer between yes and no so now that we know we have five nights we know that the answer propagates five times and because we have five names we know that the answer flips five times the order in which this happens really doesn't matter so then let's imagine that the first guy is a knight so when you ask him if I asked if you were a knight what would you say he would say yes so if we propagate that answer five times then if there remaining five Islanders and knaves they flip the answer five times so then the final guy would say no so then the first guy isn't a knight from this alone we can already figure out that he's a knave but let's just test it out anyway to be sure so if the first guy were in knave when you asked him if I asked if you were a knight what would you say he would say no so if we propagate this answer five times and then flip it five times we end up with the eleventh guy saying yes therefore the first person in line is a knave okay we're up to the last one this one is really fun so I urge you to try it yourself before we solve it together so you're trying to get the hell off this godforsaken island when you run into another group of ten Islanders you don't make the same mistake of asking any questions but before you can get away the first one says at least one of us is a knave then the second one says at least two of us are knaves then the third one says at least three of us are knaves the pattern continues until the tenth one says at least ten of us are names how many of them are names pause the video here to try it for yourself so the first thing that immediately grabs my attention here is the very last statement at least ten of us and knaves think about this if at least ten of them were knaves that would mean they were all knaves but then that would make this statement true but we know that names always lie though this statement were truth that would mean that this last guy here is a knight which would make the statement not true so then we know for sure that this guy is a knave so then if we go to the first guy who says at least one of us is a knave well we know for sure that this guy over here is a knave so that means that this guy here is telling the truth so he must be a knight now let's go to guy number nine who says at least nine of us and knaves we know for sure that of the ten one of them is definitely a knight so then the remaining nine could be knaves but that would make this statement true which would make him a knight but if he's a knight then there would only be eight knaves and because Knights can't lie he must be a knave so then when we go to the second guy in line who says at least two of us are knaves we know he's telling the truth because guy nine and guy 10 are both knaves so he must be a knight this pattern continues all the way until the middle and because there's ten Islanders in total we know that there must be five nights and five knaves so that's out three riddles guys I hope you had as much fun solving them as I did like anything getting better at solving problems just takes practice so org slash up and Adam link is in the description thanks for watching guys so this video was a bit different to my regular kind of videos and that's because my regular videos take me about two weeks to make because I do a lot of research and take a lot of time to do the animations and these kinds of videos don't take me that long because there's not really that much research that goes into them because it's solving problems and that's cool because it means I can upload more frequently so you don't have to wait so long in between videos so let me know if you would like to see more of this kind of problem-solving style video let me know in the comments and by liking the video if the video gets to a thousand likes in the first two days then that'll be a pretty strong indication to me that you guys like this kind of video and share them with your friends as well yeah that's it from me and I'll see you in the next video bye [Music]
