hello this is chef john from foodwishes.com with strawberry oatmeal breakfast bars that's right i'm always on the lookout for easy and delicious things to make for breakfast that on one hand are relatively healthy and good for you while on the other hand not too good for you since after fasting all night we do want something that seems like a little bit of a treat and i really do think these fit the bill oh and by the way these are usually made with strawberry preserves but here we're using fresh strawberries for a little bit lighter less high sugar approach but don't worry they're going to be sweet enough so with that let's go ahead and get started by dicing our berries and that'll begin by removing those green leaves from the top using the tip of a small sharp knife and sure if you have one you could use a strawberry huller but most people don't have those so just do it this way and then what we'll do once that's hauled is place that cut side down and then slice it in half and then we will cut each of those halves lengthwise like three or four or five times depending on the size of the strawberry before turning and cutting across into a nice uniform dice and that's it very simple very easy so we'll go ahead and do that to about a pound of strawberries which is going to give us about three cups and then to those we will add a little touch of freshly squeezed lemon juice along with a little bit of white granulated sugar and then we'll finish up with a couple teaspoons of cornstarch at which point we'll take a spoon and mix this very thoroughly or at the very least until all that cornstarch disappears and that's it we will simply let that sit out at room temp while we move on to our only other component our oatmeal mixture which is going to start with some rolled oats or as they're called in every recipe for some reason old-fashioned rolled oats i mean is there some kind of new trendy style of rolled oats i don't know about but anyway to that we will add some flour and i'm going to use half white all purpose and half wheat although if you want you can use all one or the other we'll also need a half a cup of firmly packed brown sugar as well as a little bit of salt and a nice healthy pinch of ground ginger which is lovely with both strawberries and oats and then to bring all this together we will pour in one stick of melted unsalted butter also known as eight tablespoons or four fluid ounces or 120 ml as they say in france only they say in french and that's it once everything's in there we'll go ahead and work this over with a spoon until we are 100 positive that butter is coated every grain of sugar and every single rolled out and if everything goes according to plan it should look something like this and don't be concerned if this mixture looks a little dry to you okay don't forget we're using fresh strawberries which are going to release a fair amount of liquid so we're going to be okay and then once that's set we'll go ahead and transfer sixty percent of that mixture into the bottom of a buttered baking dish and we'll do our best to get that as even as possible and if you're wondering how the heck am i supposed to transfer exactly sixty percent in well you're not okay just transfer in what you think is about half and then add a little more and once that's been accomplished what we'll do is pack it down a little bit with the back of a spoon or spatula just to compress and compact that a little bit before we top it with our strawberries and if we have one what we'll want to use here is a slotted spoon so that any of those excess juices stay in the bowl at least for now oh and unlike that layer of crumbs we just did we do not want these diced strawberries compressed so we'll sort of sprinkle those over with a relatively light touch and the reason for that is we want our top layer of crumbs to sort of nestle down into all the nooks and crannies and if we press these strawberries down now there aren't going to be any nooks and there are certainly not going to be any crannies so please spoon those over without pressing them down oh and once you're done do not discard any of those accumulated juices okay we're going to use those in a minute and that's it to finish this we'll simply sprinkle over the rest of our crumbs which should settle in and around those pieces of strawberry quite nicely but once the last of our crumbs have been applied then we can and should give this a nice pressing with the back of the spoon okay we really don't want to press those strawberries down into the bottom layer too much but i think we do want everything nicely compacted and then for one final touch we'll go ahead and take that tablespoon or two of strawberry juices from the bowl and we will spoon that over the top and when we can't spoon anymore we will let it drip over the top and that's it once that's been juiced it is now ready to transfer into the center of a 375 degree oven for about 45 minutes or so or until it looks like this okay that top should definitely be golden brown and if it's not put it back in for a while and then before we serve this we have to let it cool all the way down i mean you could serve it now but you need a spoon and probably some vanilla ice cream but if we want breakfast bars we have to let this cool although one thing we can do while this is still hot is take a spatula and give this a nice firm pressing and what that'll do is give us a little nicer little denser texture once this is cooled so we'll give that a pressing and let it cool down to room temp at which point we can go ahead and cut that into bars and i cut mine once down the middle and then turned it and cut it across into eight portions which is a fairly generous serving okay you could definitely cut those bars in half to make 16. but of course that's up to you i mean you are after all the bruno mars of your strawberry oatmeal breakfast bars but if you are actually going to have these for breakfast i think cutting this into eight makes the perfect size oh and speaking of size if you want these thicker just use a smaller pan but personally i do like the thinner approach but anyway i served that up and went in for a taste and if you've cooked it long enough and let it cool all the way down it should stay together in bar form and if it doesn't you must have done something wrong but that's okay just eat it with a fork but no matter what your delivery system i think you're going to find these every bit as delicious as i did all right the combination of that fresh just sweet enough strawberry components and those sort of crusty chewy granola like oatmeal crumbs really does make for a wonderful thing to eat and as i mentioned these types of fruity breakfast bars are usually made with preserves and tend to be a lot sweeter and more dessert-like but by using the fresh strawberries we've achieved something a little bit on the lighter side yet still sweet enough and very very satisfying but if you did want to turn up the sweetness a little bit some people like to pipe over a few stripes of icing which is kind of pretty and definitely makes these a little more dessert like but personally especially for breakfast i like these just the way they are but either way i really do hope you give these a try soon so please follow the links below
