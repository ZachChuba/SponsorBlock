hello this is chef john from food wishes
calm with poutine that's right some people consider this one of the most
overrated recipes in history which i don't necessarily agree with remember
cakepops so i'll let people with more free time than I have argue about that
but one recipe that's definitely not overrated
is a from scratch extra meaty super savory beef gravy which is basically
what 95% of this video is so with that let's go ahead get started and first up
I'm gonna add about a pound of chopped beef to this pan set over high heat into
which I've drizzled just a little bit of oil in incase you're keeping score at
home I'm using some beef chuck although some chopped up short rib or brisket
would also be lovely and for some to qualify as a gravy it needs to be made
with the leftover fat and pan drippings after cook some meat so to simulate
that we're gonna Brown some meat to start here and then we'll go ahead and
use that as the base of our gravy thereby satisfying all legal
requirements and because we put in a pretty good amount of meat here as this
comes up to temperature instead of sauteing it's actually going to start
boiling in its own juices which if we were cooking something like a steak
would be a huge problem but here as you'll see it's definitely not an issue
because all we have to do is wait for that liquid to evaporate at which point
our meat should start to brown nicely and above and beyond getting a nice
level of browning on the meat we should also see some of that beefy goodness
caramelizing onto the bottom of the pan which is any legit food which I will
tell is called a Fond Fon D and now what we'll do once our
meat is nicely browned and we have a well-developed Fond because we'll go
ahead and toss in a little touch of butter just a half a stick and we'll
reduce our heat to medium and we'll go ahead and stir that in until it melts
and the reason we're using so much is not just because we're about to saute
some onions but we also need a decent amount of fat to make the roux which is
going to thicken our gravy eventually so like I said we'll go ahead and stir that
in at which point when go ahead and add our diced onion and also at this
time we will add a nice big pinch of salt as well as some freshly ground
black pepper and a little shake a Cayenne
and what we want to do here is cook those onions in this beautifully beefy
butter until they soften up and start to turn golden and one thing I want to
notice here is we're doing this because we added some salt to those onions it's
actually gonna dry out some moisture which will as stir this deglaze the
bottom of the pan okay remember that Brown Fond that was stuck on the bottom
that has now been magically released into this mixture which not only means
more flavor but a nice deep rich color but anyway like I said we'll go ahead
and saute that onion until it turns golden at which point we can go ahead
and add our flour and we'll stir that in to form a roux and what we always want
to do before we add our liquid is cook this for a few minutes to take the raw
edge off the flour okay we don't want our roux to taste pasty even though
sometimes pastes are tasty we actually want that flour to toast up a little bit
which is why one of my favorite root tips is to cook it until it smells like
cooked pie crust so I went ahead and cooked that still over medium heat for
about three or four minutes and then once we've decided our Roux is cook long
enough we will go ahead and add our beef broth preferably homemade and yes of
course we have a video for that or if want it's totally fine to use a
high-quality low-sodium carton variety I mean especially if made your own
curds but anyway we'll go ahead and stir in whatever stock or broth we're using
at which point we can crank our heat up to high because we want to bring this up
to a simmer and then once our mixture is simmering what we'll do is back our heat
down to medium and continue cooking stirring occasionally until our gravy is
as thick as we want and how long that takes I have no idea since it really
depends on how loose or stiff want your texture I mean are after all
the wavy gravy of how wavy to make your gravy and by the way yes that was a real
person's name and from what I know he ate a lot of food like this but anyway
the point is you're gonna have to decide how long December this is sure we could
if we want just use more Roux and as soon as this came up to a simmer it
would have already been nice and thick but if we did take that approach all our
little pieces of meat would not have time to get tender not to mention we
wouldn't be concentrating our flavors so I much prefer this method using more
broth than we need and reducing everything down until we're happy
oh and let me sneak in one bonus tip here don't be afraid to deglaze that
goodness has cooked on to the sides alright we definitely want to try to
dissolve that and stir it into our gravy and in the business that's referred to
as side found but anyway we'll go ahead and patiently wait for that to reduce to
our liking and if we've been shamed into making homemade french fries for our
poutine this would be the perfect time to prep them as well as of course whip
up a quick batch of cheese curds so while our gravy is getting less wavy we
can go ahead and prep whatever else we're gonna need and then right here I'm
gonna give a great look at how far I reduce mine okay I definitely want this
thick enough to coat my curds so to me this looks just about perfect and of
course we're gonna give it a taste to make sure our little bits of meat are
nice and tender which they should be as well as to determine if we need some
more salt and while my meat was magnificent I did decide I need a little
extra touch of salt alright keep in mind so often the difference between a great
gravy and a good gravy is like a quarter teaspoon of salt so that's definitely
something want to check and that's it once we're perfectly happy with how
this looks feels and tastes we can go ahead and assemble our poutine starting
with some beautifully crisp homemade french fries which in the spirit of full
disclosure I will say if I wasn't filming this those would have been
frozen crinkle-cut fries which are my personal favorite for this but anyway
didn't want the other food bloggers making fun of me so I went with homemade
and then next up we'll go ahead and scatter over our cheese curds which I
like to break up a little bit and didn't hear this for me but if can't
find cheese curds and don't want to spend like three days making them you
could probably just toss out a handful of grated cheese I'm sure our French
Kati and friends would have no problem with that and then of course we're gonna
cover all that with our beautiful freshly made beef gravy and what you
want to do is ladle that over until think have enough and then add one
more half ladle and that's it other than a few chives for the pictures our semi
proper poutine is done so let me go ahead and grab a fork and dig in
and now withstanding the amount of effort this requires to make it all from
scratch it really is an incredibly savory and delicious dish unless of
course were hoping your fry stayed crispy in which
case might not enjoy this because they definitely get soggy as soon as the
gravy hits them alright still an amazing combination of flavors intensely savory
super beefy I mean any one of these components is amazing on its own so of
course they're all good together but the one drawback and why this dish is so
often the center of debate is the fact those fries are gonna get soaked with
gravy and get soft so yes this is a very delicious dish but is it so good
that making it from scratch is worth all the effort that my friends is the
question which I'm not gonna answer know what I actually just thought of
something I wonder how this would be with my famous crispy cauliflower fries
yes that was a little bit of an inside joke with my fellow food wishes but
anyway whether make a proper poutine from scratch or just simply make this
delicious and very versatile gravy I really do hope give this a try soon
so head over to food wishes comm for all the ingredient amounts of more info as
usual and as always enjoy
