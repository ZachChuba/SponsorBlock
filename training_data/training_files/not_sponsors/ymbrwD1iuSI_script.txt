thought you could kill someone while i was on download in comms you know i saw you right where it's not me yep i mean no technically not because that's because that's what i honestly think though all good let's all right ah i wanted to do it uh all right it's fine i don't think i kill hafu there hmm i think that was a good timing stupid do you think i am oh okay honestly you were honest i thought you could kill someone while i was on download in comms you know i saw you right now wait wait this is all hard accused wait wait wait but the thing is i was there so who did wait what yeah i was there it was me dumb dog and and dumb dog was on the pulley down thing but this because the frown just started i was going to call dumb dog out for taking more than half a second which is what it because you weren't on the download right i'm not going to i was on the wi-fi yeah yeah and it took you so long uh upload is actually what it was in inside of comms as soon as i get off of it i started walking down the report wait so it's not a heart accused or is it it is a heart well no no no i i feel like either dumb dog had to have seen who did it or he did it and ran away oh i thought it's just it's just so like it's so it was the amount of time for me to start my download and get off that he not only left comms but somebody killed right right outside of it okay so dumb dog it's looking like you have uh 12 seconds to defend yourself i i don't think it's well the wagon did you see dumb dog running i kind of don't think it's done you know what this is not a dumb dumb i don't think he'd leave you in weapons or comms and then kill outside i don't know well if he is innocent i did him a favor that was a very very clean opportunity from me i will always take that nobody saw me here though which is unfortunate uh i was hoping someone would see me do the water i need to kill hafu now oh you need too much oh there's someone going into top specialty right now i think doors closed as well that's you yeah it's dumb dog again his body is right at vials so oh i i'm on medscan i think i canceled yeah well huff is there on med scan so it's either her or event or i'm actually on the download already in specs like that's how long like wait wait i literally just saw spec stores closed how are you already on the download because they just closed for me like you saw the second set close okay listen okay there's two things i did the temperature thing with steve and i went up and did the rocket or the drill and then realize i had the node just outside so you were very close you're very close to the body but i mean i left before and then five i'm pretty much waxing the weather note outside of storage right now just giving it a little kiss as i go to fix electrical [ __ ] gross dude lonely i'm inclined to believe that this is dumb dog based off the previous round and why okay but here's the thing which is interesting because hafu literally just saw me there i wouldn't kill right in front of hafu unless she was killed so i trust peter because i spent the entire first thing with uh heaven storage and i also trust steve because he kept checking on us trust you too scott oh wait hi who do you think it is i think it is apollo really i think it is the doggy dog towards being apollo again there's a chance why why do i not think it's apollo what because you feel like you should be you also didn't think it was apollo lost if it wasn't really she thinks it's me because they're clean kills this is unfair she needs to die she's my next target [Laughter] uh okay i hope he has a kill i got a really really clean kill on him and then i was like okay i'm just gonna have to do because you're in such a good spot i'm so glad i did i don't think i think they would have voted yet anyway dumb dog yeah that's just well played i wouldn't well done no one had any idea besides detective steve i said i didn't think it was done though steve i nearly went up in your kitchen can i i i want to show you what happened for that guilty though really it looked really bad it looked horrible for him i'm trying to get a clip we did we got to win we're part of the winners today no that was a really good i've won most of my imposter games tonight actually oh uh i'm i'm joining the winners club i won with wilf and with talia oh boy that was a mediocre one but this is gonna be a better one hold on and we just head off to the left side we don't kill him ah this is so unfortunate for me to train and hop with the exact same timing i have to do a fancy plate no i accused him of being in a plaster when i walked by him all right he deserved it it's fine we can skip okay no where is he i'm going to keep it a buck 50. please keep it about 50. do it wolf where'd you just come from to get into nav uh weapons you know what's crazy the boss actually o2 o2 no i think this is this is pretty old because i passed him like a long time ago i was i did my tasks on the right side and i did shields and he was passing me at shields so if he's a nav then it's pretty old no he's in weapons oh well it's still pretty old probably because he was coming from the left into shields like going upwards and i was like oh my god oh my god i'm dead i'm dead if it's all the people that were there were i love first so i'm not gonna put my name in there uh apollo wolfebell so i did my leaves so there's well where did tico come from because he just showed up in the election oh i just did the first part of trash and i went straight down and then i walked into electrical first part of trash and you went straight down and you just no i did the second part no i did that's what i said i did the second part and listen i'm gonna keep it a buck fifty whenever whenever trains imposter he always says i'm gonna keep it a bug 50 and he said that every round yeah i mean true ck train where were you because i had a dollar twenty five navigation with a bell dollar tree like just pulled up yeah oh alex i think you just incarnated yourself you're doing you're doing tasks in there now you're just going out of the way to blame people well i was on top of him and then if he got off his house he would have seen me 100 because i didn't find myself on twitter i was literally interested with her all right nobody oh love waffle's coming here nice perfect freak she's gonna hard clear me hopefully from that that's such a good task for me to fake please let this play work off all right i have marinated hafu hafu is now successfully marinated what bro that was weird all right where was everybody it's not me you're just standing on the body yeah i was looking for it the lights are not off no i'm not like guys okay so i just started the round and i run up to lights and i go in and i see a report button but the light the crew vision's small right so i just want to see if i see where the body is and i walk to it instead of like you know he doesn't see me killing he doesn't see me on the body he sees me staring at the body standing still is that not right dumb dog you were kind of walking away from it to the right which was a little weird but the last time this happened to me i let it get no i wanna i wanna oh okay you can vote no i promise you i'm i'm a criminal it's just one of the situations where like i i do we need to know where the body is in the back of electrical do we need to know where it's standing okay uh just here's here's why we're going to vote me out on six and they're gonna win so just get me out now so i don't throw the game please okay i'm done to do that i don't think he's gonna because people are gonna vote me on six happy i'm just gonna throw the game also i also think train is crew i want you guys to know i'm not impossible please i'm being honest come on i'm gonna go pee i don't care [Laughter] okay i've been burned too many times you said you wanted to pee so i wanted to vote maybe actually i hate this she's using so much meta reasons onto why he's good it's purely because of how he was speaking there of why she cleared him that's unfortunate that is unfortunate for me all right all right what do we got hapu and train's dead wait where is this holy [ __ ] this is uh lower engine left lower engine left lower engine okay who just came into uh electrical with me there was someone right behind um i just left on top of you now i didn't come in with you though but i saw you in there i'm going to go ahead and like clear waterville yeah i've been would be like every round uh huffle left me when i was scanning so i assumed that she died maybe she realistically she's lower engine she died off cooldown um so this is a very fresh kill um i wasn't really coming from the body last round and that's very sus that you tried to make that frame that on me all i know is i was like still staring at it when you walked up to me and you tried to paint it like i was running from i'm going to try to say you're good dk thank you [Laughter] she ended saying i don't like dumb dogs that's what i think that was yeah you did the round literally just started this thing from the right there's no way i could have come from the left i did like three tasks i i don't like how you made the vote and try to go for me all right i guess i have to go dk then i'm putting dumb dog he tried to paint it like i was running for my body oh i'm going to fix them i don't want to risk it this will buy dk's trust actually we'll keep them off every time someone says where the body is you always like repeat it like whenever he said his lower engine you were like hmm lower engine he said you're going to light sounds like it's game over baby you think it was me right you know someone's telling me uh i wasn't sure about you but um from the way dk defended there was no way he was imposter but did you but did you say like out loud that you didn't think it was me or did i no i said i would not no i did i did i wasn't sure about you because you were hardcursing on someone i thought was crew from his defense i knew you're an innocent trainer it sounded like uh you were trying to get a freebie there thank you like a weird heart accused for me i wasn't sure about you and i wasn't even sure about dk but like the way he defended was the most crue thing ever you might have been able to see the vent actually you
