is he gonna make it in the NFL gee if he is system quarterback what Dylan the funny thing about that though is this is the first system that he got to run that was an NFL system right and I think every quarterback is a system quarterback you know I think I said that to her laughs do one day I was like I forget what I was like you know what is a term game manager why is that a shot always like oh this guy's a game manager he touches the ball every single play of course he's the guy that's managing it they're like this guy every play every quarterback is a game manager it's like well if they don't make the risky tough throws then they're not the quarterback to you but they're like Alex Smith was always like the classic oh this guy's a game manager you know wouldn't some games for him well what does a quarterback supposed to do I feel like every quarterback to the system quarterback though like if you end up in the right system for you you're gonna have success in now it's magic he's won in every system in it Wow Wow that's why we got to talk all the same yeah they're doing well let's look at Lamar Jackson Lamar Jackson was in a Joe Flacco system last year they they put took out handsome Joe Flacco put in Lamar they obviously tried to hinder some things but that system that offense was built for Joe Flacco quarterback not for Lamar Jackson they flipped that thing for Lamar Jackson now that system is built around his best assets he has one of the best years in the history of ennifer quarterbacks now granted Tennessee Titans in big swing and very will walk in there and knock them off but I think the system quarterback title and game manager thing it's like every single quarterback is one of those things is Tom Brady a system quarterback because Josh McDaniels was calling plays and Bill Belichick was running the defense I I don't know well I guess we'll find out if he goes too right we'll find out this year what if he goes to the Bears Bell seeking now back to the magic it's also not plug-and-play like you can't say that like all anyone in college would have thrown 60 touchdowns at LSU this year that's just not true but also I think the the fact that he won from 16 touchdowns to sixty touchdowns I would argue that he wasn't in the right system the first time or maybe he wasn't good enough right he said he didn't work at OSU I don't think you would I gave him any chance to play with the quarterbacks that they had there and I mean he was in the locker room with you JT was there Haskins yeah I mean he was that was a loaded locker quarterback room I don't think he would have ever played he wanted to play he goes down there goes hard but I think every quarterback that has success is a system quarterback because the the system he's running is successful Krantz that's just say I think that is an old-school term for people that are too lazy to actually say a real opinion yes you know I mean all these game manager people used to sit about Brady after like his first two Super Bowl so I assistant quarterback everybody I was assistant partners you see what I did we're button right we're fun left got it all right that's our system all right I'm gonna do the hell out of that then like everybody's a system whatever it makes no sense at all no sense yeah well he doesn't break the play and make plays by himself well Joe Burrell I think proof that he did do that he broke the system last night I play the game tape he shocked the system undisputed air
