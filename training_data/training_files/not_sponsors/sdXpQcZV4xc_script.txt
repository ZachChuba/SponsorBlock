[Music] today's video was sponsored by Squarespace how's it going folks are you gonna be good you just gonna do that the whole time are we good over there test test alright hey guys welcome back to my channel today's video is a little bit different from what we're used to doing let's start with a i'm on couch b I have one of these I thought to take a break from some of my design videos to give myself a mental break and also maybe some of my other viewers who might not enjoy that so much a little bit of a break change of content you know my drink now this time around I don't have some wine but I do have some very thematic Lima Rita in a margarita cactus glass with my frosty cactus pillow right here oh my desert themed with couch it's sure you could call it that I have my fire because it's winter or so they tell me I wouldn't know because it's still a tea in LA but it actually was raining a little bit out so who knows changing of seasons he doesn't know what he wants and neither do i I probably take my Crocs off get my Crocs on but I should take them off because they're really loud alright so I thought for this week's video we're gonna be reading and responding to some of my DMS I have a lot of DMS ever since I've got got gained ever since I've gained some traction on YouTube I opened my DMS up to anybody who's anybody and my dams have become very overwhelming and I am very afraid to answer a lot of them because there are so many and I don't want people to feel like I'm ignoring them intentionally but please trust me there are just so many of them that I it's overwhelming so I'm gonna go through some of them right now and maybe I'll be able to answer some of the questions that you might have just so we can like kind of cover some general ground about anything anything that's in my dams I'm gonna try to answer as many of them not as many of them I'm gonna answer a good chunk of them this evening and that's what we're gonna do so if you enjoyed watching this video make sure you leave a like down below and comment if you want to see more videos from me and also subscribe that'll actually help you see more videos from me never mind I'm gonna stop rambling gonna get that get a get going now alright just to start this off I have 99 plus in my DM request right now on Instagram so there are a lot and I apologize if I haven't gotten back to you I don't know how me there are at this point because it just they're more keep coming guys though I'm a little overwhelmed so let's yeah so I'm gonna ask me to do ASMR that's your ass boy alright this is a really common one so this person says hi Kelly I'm a huge fan of your work and videos and was curious as to what tablet you use Thanks long story short I use the Wacom Intuos tablet it's the smallest one it's like $80 here in the US if you are looking into getting a tablet I do not recommend getting this tablet I do recommend getting the one that's like the medium-size way come in to us they usually sit around like 280 to 300 dollars but if you are thinking about taking design seriously I highly highly highly recommend getting this tablet over the smaller one because the small one it gets the job done but it's incredibly frustrating I've had mine for a few years and I want to break it in half it doesn't have as nearly as much of the sensitivity and just like the general like feel of having the I don't think the smallest one but there's like a small square one and then they get longer and they get a little bit thicker the one that I have is really small and rinky-dinky and I just get anything bigger than that from Wakeham and I can leave a Wakeham link in my description box below because a lot of people to ask me so get a nicer one they're worth the investment I don't even have a nicer okay Sophie says I'd love to see you design something deadheads last John Mayer slash online ceramics like taking on their kind of aesthetic by designing whatever you want like your ideal merch from them I don't know if this makes sense Sophie I love this idea John Mayer is someone I work with at my normal day-to-day job and his aesthetic is absolutely wonderful and I adore online ceramics quite a bit I don't know if you've seen like in other videos I've worn my own in ceramics hoodie and I also have a tea fish I have two teas from them and I adore their brand I love the guys who run it I think they're awesome people and I love John Mayer so I think this would be a great project so I don't know good idea I'll take it into consideration okay I saw this one and I intentionally didn't want to answer it because I wanted to give it a better answer so this is from Abigail and she says hi Kelly I've only recently started getting into graphic design as a part of my job I run in social media and make promotional content from a campus TV station awesome but I've noticed I spend way too much time fiddling with things like fonts and colors and not enough time actually finishing projects how do you balance the desire to have something look perfect with having to work on such a deadline thank you so much for taking the time to read this I love your videos this is a conundrum that a lot of people run into and I think it gets better with time and a lot of experience I have this term that I've heard other people throw around - it's called pixel pushing it's something where you really hone on one like little spot and you're like oh I'll keep tweaking this and I'll keep tweaking this and you go on and on and on and then you know it's been like two hours if you still haven't finished this project that should have taken you like a half hour and you just you go down a wormhole I get it but remember that you can always come back to something and so what I like to do is build kind of like like I I like to layer things so I can build the foundation and I'll come back and do like sweeps of work on top of it instead of like building one part here building one part here but building one apart here and then kind of building it brick by brick versus like kind of doing it all simultaneously and I think that a helps your timeline a little bit better and also prevents you from like perfecting one little piece and then everything else looks disjointed and yeah remember you can always change something so you don't have to settle in something immediately because chances are it's gonna change quite a bit between where you started - the end product I hope that made sense so that makes sense thanks Marissa asks my dude where is your phone case room it's so cool it's this case right here it says powerful woman and it's from Kista Phi and I can link that below - this person asks are you a tourist no I'm a Pisces but I also don't believe in astrology moving on this is an interesting one he says hi my name is Spencer and I'm doing an argumentative paper for school about why retro design is better than modern design and I was hoping I could get your opinion as an expert on design Spencer I would not consider myself an expert on design I sometimes act like I am but I'm not but let me think about this this is tough why is retro design better I think like anything history repeats itself and we kind of tend to fall into these cycles of every trend kind of goes and in and out and it'll come back in like 30 40 years I think that goes for like fashion it goes for architecture in general like I feel like in a sense like political trends I feel like every so often there is a new cycle political uproar and I think that's just how things go so when we look back at something being retro we look back at something that might have already worked versus like modern design I feel as just when you say like modern I'm assuming you mean like more minimal clean basic versus like retro might be a little bit more homey that's kind of what I feel I don't know if that's a good answer to your question that's it that's a tough prompt but I would say retro is better because we feel it is more consistent and we feel that it has already worked so that's me that's my general approach that'd be a fun essay to argue though I know I'd love doing that because I love to argue and I love to write essays all right does this person's name I'm assuming her name is Maddy so Maddy asks hi Kelly I recently stumbled upon your YouTube channel and I'm so glad I did I'm going into college to become a graphic designer awesome and your videos have really helped me see inside the world of graphic design you're redesigning videos I'm really caught my attention and I am really in love with them for one of the college's I have applied to I have to submit a portfolio and I wanted to submit a logo redesign but my dad says I could get in trouble for plagiarism and I was wondering what you thought about it and could I get in trouble for it thank you much love Maddy my dear the first of all plagiarism is blatantly ripping something off and redesigning logos you're changing it enough and generally the rule is if you change something within like has been more than 30% of the original product for it to be like creatively your own but also it's a school portfolio project I do not think Kellogg's is gonna come after you because you redesigned their logo if you like slightly knock off their logo and then start profiting off of it and selling a knockoff version of their brand then you can get in trouble like legally speaking but yeah for a school project absolutely not and also under YouTube I'm covered by fair use I can I can do these things because I'm not explicitly selling these brands under these new logos so it's complicated until someone starts to come for us then things are gonna change but no Maddy you're good some people are just like really nice like people just damn me like the nicest things and I really appreciate you guys cuz I have some hard days it's like today and I really I really enjoy being able to like open my Instagram and have people be like hey you're awesome so really helps shut up oh okay this is a good one this person's name is Elias and he asks any advice for personal branding I'm having trouble making a monogram for my initials en oh is my dear personal branding is very difficult and it's something that all designers have issues with I have to I have had many many identity crises with my own personal branding for something that's like an Ian and and those are kind of complicated but maybe find a new way that you could create like a more of like a Pictou mark or just like an icon that might represent your brand a little bit better than a knee and an end yeah maybe come up with more creative ways that you could represent your name because I know a lot of designers love to fall into like using their initials for their design I use my initials in my design cause it kind of worked out that way but you could easily just do something else you could totally do literally anything it doesn't matter also I get a lot of DMS about people who are like 14 15 who are like I'm stressing out about what I'm gonna study in college or like I'm thinking about becoming a graphic designer first of all go you for thinking of that but second of all relax you're okay you don't need to decide these things so early on that's awesome if you want to study it but do not stress yourself out about what you're gonna put in your college portfolio if you're literally like a freshman in high school you're fine you got so much time to worry about that stuff good lord yeah I get I get quite a lot of those a lot of people say they would die for George which I would also die for George she's amazing see another one a person who's 14 and asking for creative tips to be a better graphic designer like guys go scrolling tick tock or whatever the kids do nowadays I get quite a few questions about if I'd ever do tutorials on just some of the techniques that I use in illustrator and Photoshop or like how I pair type and that's definitely something that I've thought about but those videos do take it like a little bit more planning than I'm emotionally responsible for right now just so I can make a solid course that is clear and cohesive and actually teaches a good lesson that is something on the horizon for something that I do want to cover this person says hey just want to let you know that I'm so thankful for you because you helped me figure out what I wanted to do it isn't and I just can't thank you enough you're incredible I get actually a surprising could have quite a few of these as well which is mind-boggling to me because I still consider myself quite a mess as I had a small meltdown a few hours ago but that's really awesome that you guys feel that you can look up to me and ask me things and like feel that you have someone to like I don't know admire and it sounds really dumb coming from me because I'm me but I never had anyone to look up to when I was like going through design school and like wanting to be I'm a graphic designer there just aren't a lot of people in the fields especially like women and people who like when I'm work in music and like designers who want to work in like fashion and stuff like it's just it's it's a tough world out there and so having someone that you feel that like you can talk to I think is really awesome and just like even like I don't know feel that like you're working towards someone because you have someone that you admire I think that's really awesome and I'm incredibly grateful that I have people who feel that they can see that in me does that make sense I'm not sure but it's very strange to me but it makes me feel a little bit better about myself sometimes because I could be very hard on myself and I know Matt can attest to that too but yeah so thank you guys I really appreciate you sending like really nice messages like that because it definitely gets me through a lot of tough days Oh a classic a classic classic classic fan favorite question that I've gotten since the beginning of my youtube channel what do you know what it is do it I guess where are my glasses from ladies yes Maria asks hi I just found your logo redesign videos and I'm obsessed I'm sure you get asked this all the time but I'm going to ask as well what is the style name of ribbon glasses you wear I'm in the market for new glasses and yours are perfect I don't know what style mine are I know they're a very common frame now but minor the sunglasses frames they make the eyeglasses in silver and black but they also make them in gold but they're only in the sunglasses so I just had them switch out the lenses with my prescription into the frames that are technically the sunglasses frames but also like there are a ton of brands now that have like knockoffs of these frames so it's really I don't think that hard-to-find frames that are similar to these I'm getting new glasses as soon as I get it together because I really need a new prescription because these aren't no good for me anymore so or some tacos at this plant it's a taco tooth okay Anna asks hi I want to get into graphic design and creative directing for a career someday and I was wondering if you have any tips on getting internships I want to apply for some but I'm not sure how to start my portfolio this is a common question I get to maybe one day I can do a video on like how to make a good portfolio but ultimately at the end of the day what I found what works for me and what I learned in school and if you could watch like my art school video and you can also watch my first portfolio video review at the end of the day you want to have a portfolio that is diverse that can show an array of things that you can do so my portfolio is spread out from my packaging design to content creation to surface design to UX design to branding and also merchandise design those are very different fields none of those fields overlap so it's not like I have like three branding projects I also have a layout a layout project in my portfolio but none of those things necessarily overlap I don't have like a few branding projects a few packaging design projects I keep it very short and sweet because ultimately at the end of the day our recruiter is looking for someone who like looks good on paper and when you're in front of someone who's creative who's looking at your portfolio they want to see what you can do and what you can bring to the table and also most of the time people hire personalities and they want to hire someone that they want to work with you don't have to be the best designer out there but if you're cool and you're fun to hang out with in you know like you're good around people and not necessarily you don't think great around people but you have to be enjoyable to work with especially in a creative space so that's what I mean like people hire personalities they want you to fit in with the team and especially as an internship you're there to learn so don't sweat it too much just make sure like just show what you can do you're still in school there's that understanding that you're still in school or I don't know maybe you recently came out of school and you're so applying for an internship but they understand that you're very young and you're there to learn so that's the general understanding for that so don't sweat it keep it diverse keep it short and keep it accessible so either have a website have a physical portfolio or have what I had in my old portfolio is like a literal CD and some people have like flash drives and the only thing on there flash drive is a PDF their portfolio keep it as easy as possible for someone to just like click through it and generally websites are the for that and I recommend using Squarespace use code Kel lard for 10% off your purchase take a portfolio started I have a sound of a stolen lime in the distance all right this dam comes from Catalina she says hello Kelly my name is Catalina I'm a design student at Pacific University and I recently in recently your video hello Kelly my name is Kalina I'm a design student at Pacific University and recently your video showed up in my recommendations on YouTube I'm trying to start actually putting my work on Instagram and I was curious if you had any insight on how to do that and getting over the whole quote my work isn't good enough yet mindset hey Alina I deal with this every single day this never really goes away and unfortunately that's a hard pill to swallow because I talked to other people who are older than me or more experienced than me and they're like yeah I know it never goes away you will always forever have impostor syndrome that's just the downside of it but putting your stuff on Instagram that's completely like that's know like don't sweat that like chances are you probably awesome if you feel like you should put it on Instagram yeah girl put it on Instagram and also that X is like a mobile portfolio for you that's awesome in regards to feeling not good enough I really struggle with this still and I think at the end of the day if you surround yourself with people that you trust you trust their opinion mostly mostly that you trust their opinion and you ask for honest feedback and you're generally pretty self aware of how good you are I feel that my work is absolutely awful and I could light it on fire at any given point in time because that's what I feel like I should do but I know that generally I'm a decent designer at the end of the day I have people who will tell me that when I feel really terrible about myself and that's part of having like your circle of trust and people that you can communicate with and you can have honest feedback with so getting over that it's really just you just you got it you got to take that first step just take the leap and just like everything will fall into place from there so don't sweat it you got this I believe in you got Instagram we started and I got to scroll down hello don't you come here please please I need you George hey come here everyone wants to see you buddy literally everybody okay that worked what's up my bud he's not gonna like this chord [Music] okay this person asks hey love I was wondering how you make your intro for YouTube with the whole typeface going through the whole family I suck at gifts and wanted to practice but I can't do it now my intro I will put it in here so you can be reminded of it that was done in premiere and I animated the and I made the I animated that through the keyframes so I started it the font is rock crude god I can't talk today the font is rock grotesque and I keyed in from like they're literally like a tenth of a second apart so in the first frame I have the like thin like condensed light version of rock grotesque and then I literally went like a tenth of a second over and then switching out the font-family or not competently switching out the font to a slightly thicker one a wider one until it goes to the full pretty much like what my logo looks like so yeah I just that was done in in Premiere and you just go through the font family simple is that okay I will do how many more should I do okay let me find like two good ones alright well apparently Instagram deletes my dams after two weeks so I think that's all I got now obviously I didn't go through all of my DMS and apparently my request to only stay in there for two weeks so I'm sorry if you sent me something longer than that something if you sent me something longer than two weeks ago I don't see it anymore if you want to send it to me again if it's really urgent feel free to do that so I pretty much try to answer as many of the questions that weren't like repeats they were in my DM so I hope this helps some of you and yeah if you if you have any questions that you would like me an answer either comment them down below or shoot me a DM on Instagram and I can answer them to the best of my ability as I can I guess maybe do more of these videos because I feel like a lot of my questions that I get are more or less like repeated ones so hopefully this helps some of you who are thinking about damning me a question so what to save you some time do I have too thank you so much for watching I hope this video was helpful thank you for sitting with me on my couch on this drizzly kind cold night it's not really that cold it's like 70 out it's the Matic it's the holidays I have a candle and you can see it as out of a frame but whatever I hope you enjoyed watching this and thank you for sticking around this long you guys are awesome so I don't I keep saying so I need to wrap this thank you so much for watching and I will see you guys in the next one goodbye this is what I used Ross now word from our fire [Music] you [Music]
