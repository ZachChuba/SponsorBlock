oh my god go down oh my god oh damn oh [ __ ] did it end is this the end of the game it might be i don't know you're in a [ __ ] room with a moth i don't know this maybe there's another day now that was [ __ ] scary dude previous keeper disappeared oh look at this oh whoa okay it's different you couldn't pick up that lantern i know i'm in a [ __ ] maze this is [ __ ] up there you go so he's just wandering around he went to the left right yeah god that's free i hate mazes though yeah like is there any hint as to like what i should be looking for it looks like you're doing all right whoa damn collido vision my z buffer just turned into an and x-buffer gotta warn me before you do stuff oh oh good kill it poop poop and it'll slip on the poop it's just gonna kill me it's just gonna kill me i just gotta face the facts i think you got away god whoa uh there's goo blocking like [Applause] [ __ ] mother oh [ __ ] you oh you can juke it oh my god you forgot your lantern you silly who [ __ ] cares uh the lantern lanterns are for [ __ ] we are strong scared men you don't really think that do you yes okay damn are you permanently wounded oh my god keep going keep going go down that oh am i supposed to do that i think so because it's still doing this you've got a bad headache what what what is happening are you in hell oh that flipped over remember the classic flipped boat wait what is that in the distance uh oh is that a moth tear in reality can't seem to do anything with the boat yeah it's it's implying you came in on it this is like a weird version of the beach but it's not the same place well maybe it would be if you got your act together tomorrow i like that uh flame graphic on the torch yeah it's neat it's very like elder scrolls daggerfall yeah you're doing pretty good tomorrow i'm proud of you what's that to your left oh just a bunch of jackets it was a pyramid hey it's like a ziggurat wow it's got a big statue on top i bet it's of some sort of moth entity better freaking not be so you're dead now sure feels like i feel like you're in moth hell i'm in mothra vision when we first saw the mothman that like when you came down he was standing there that was genuine fear for me because i couldn't comprehend him for like a second yeah no i was like processing what the [ __ ] i was looking at it was weird it was cool this is truly a magnificent temple i'm glad they built this and not uh a stupid lighthouse island oh what oh oh you're in ruins now so that's like tomb raider just just remember your tomb raider and your raiding tombs what the [ __ ] is that oh oh it's got a coin final coin if you can get back to that chest i mean i know that should be the furthest thing from your mind right now it's like a lever what did it do i don't know i can't pull it again oh yeah you can oh yeah what did it do this is it put down could you go that way before i don't think i could oh is that the [ __ ] chest again is it oh oh it is oh my god that one's yeah oh you gotta do it again oh i guess it's a different chest i know what was in the chest that's in my house i wonder if it's the same thing oh god or if at some point i'm gonna be stalked through this horrible place i can't imagine it's just going to let you keep running around this and not [ __ ] with you yup you got to find more of those beetle statues right i think so damn that's bright yeah let this bonfire that's like at least now i have sort of something to get a bearing off of there's no oh there there's a way to it oh it's a centipede that one's got the moth on it i would hate to be in this position this is a very like video gamey thing because if you were in this [ __ ] dungeon you saw a chest you'd just be like concerned about getting out it's true what does lighting these do it might just be something to like for yourself so you know hey i've been here oh there you go third doo doo dee doo hickey guy doodly doo pickles the drummer doodly doodle ding no you thought dong was odd what oh you're raising this up it's an elevator you raised me up every time i think about lyle that song comes to mind wait is that the oh that might be the original this is like the star yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] that's ted origiors oh that was just to make it easier to get back there that's your little dark souls loop around shortcut that means i probably missed something while i was down there there's definitely a bonfire down that way that i haven't gotten yet at least go go down there again this way because i'm pretty sure there was a sign no no behind you yeah i'm pretty sure there was a path down here you didn't take yet i think you're right you went right so go uh i thought it went left the first time did you and then go maybe oh wait no you went this way but wait let's try going this way yeah you didn't go this way yeah there we go well i can at least open the chest you got the filthy grub holy [ __ ] that that was like really good directional awareness for this channel i'm actually kind of proud of us yeah i don't want to to my own horn but i'm definitely the smartest person i know let's see here wow oh god was this all a trick this is evil did i get the bad ending what the [ __ ] what now i'm in a boat what is happening you're leaving with your precious chest that you don't want to open of mots or go to box your morphs [Music] lighting all the bonfires will somehow penalize me up you're always talking about what is that is this the big gaping hole i fell into while i was riding away from the yeah why are you living in two realities right now i don't know man all i know is i don't want to go to that island ever good we're getting closer to that barge looking thing marge is barge marge my barn [Music] don't exist it's the only thing driving tourism to west virginia what the [ __ ] i forgot about west virginia it's like everyone dead it's like i'm in the stomach of the lighthouse oh they don't [ __ ] have stomachs you silly man wait yeah they don't i'd be more scared of like an octopi looking at you how do you know there's no one looking at me right now from under the water there might be that's what scares me are you two men one pillaging and one in a cave of goo sure feels like it huh yeah oh butter biscuit you're so slow at rowing it pisses me off honestly i'm kind of scared yeah oh that actually [ __ ] got that's the main guy that's you yeah you're the mothman so wait right now i'm rowing as the box the dude like the guy that drops the dude oh yeah what the [ __ ] you can't be already this keeper disappeared oh now you're going back you know i'm the one telling the story are you the moth oh oh what the [ __ ] i don't want to be in meat it's all meaty now this is the least of my [ __ ] wants what's that more meat death death oh oh you're flipping the uh oh the i'm flipping the boat are you the monster now what are you the previous guy are you it seems like it's it's revealing like another half to the story i didn't have see okay so this is the dude that woke up wait wait wait go to the uh go to the cabin maybe you're the thing that left the goo i can't run this is getting really weird he keeps stopping and coughing i wonder why he's checking for hernia he's got a weird little flutter to his cough there is he becoming the moth oh no i really hope you're not the moth right now tomorrow you don't deserve that if i had the moth wouldn't i have neat little feelers out in front of me oh that's a good point but wait it didn't appear this would be like the end of the first day right oh yeah i think so is it going to make you play through the whole thing through the perspective of the moth i doubt it i think we're still nearing it at the end of this game go to the house i love that freaking house i'm [ __ ] round in this fella's house look at the bed look in the mirror it won't let me oh i'm coughing up blood oh he's gonna look in the mirror and then he's gonna be the moth right am i right is he come on oh you bastard i i hate that the game did it for you oh the [ __ ] are you are you the thing that you pulled the it looks kind of like the statues doesn't it now you're the one now you're the moth oh you're on the wall so what what happened then uh i'm confused oh maybe you're maybe you're so upset to being this thing that you got to kill yourself and then you were that thing that fell off no that was beforehand wasn't it this is the way uh look at the rope it was you being an [ __ ] that's where he snips it why would it make you do that though i guess he didn't just clip it he also stole it he stole the sand so maybe you have to just go down and steal the sandbags yeah [ __ ] are you eating them i think so don't eat sand tomorrow tomorrow stop please that's why he's doing it maybe he craves sandbag yum yum yum i am hungry for sand it feels my belly so hard what the [ __ ] is happening yeah do you gotta cake the walls with it now cake the walt with lots of sand shoot it from your frontal gland [Laughter] oh i can go in here go thomas okay now we're you're on the wall going down the ladder that's where you came from oh i see tarzan oh i see whoa that's kind of scary looking i like that yeah that's very like uh silent hill ooh you are the mothman i told you it's like a weird larval stage oh now you gotta [ __ ] chase that dude right yeah so now you're playing this from the other perspective yeah now you truly are controlling it but just like in the last try he gets away i mean you could open the other doors i feel like i've heard that sound before the sound effect of the scary chase it's gonna drive me crazy thinking about [Music] it [Music] i love the style of this game though what is this like giant glowing light go to words and you'll find out sounds like something a moth would want it sounds like something a moth would say probably oh look at this sphincter oh it's the moths meathole [Music] was that there the whole time i don't know that's what barry made those like holes what this is your like little moth meat hole that you sleep in and you suck your thumb in you roll around and that kind of stuff yeah you would if i could it's the beating heart it's the heart of the moth it's still hard please tomorrow do something about that i feel like using this information maybe you could like do better in another playthrough i don't know try to attack the heart that's like i don't know though that was literally like a heart underneath the lighthouse like so the lighthouse is made of meat is that what it's getting at like this whole thing is just an organism that traps you and turns you into a mothman i guess as part of a wait okay so you were you were the original guy so this moth is the original guy he he was the moth yeah i think this moth is the first guy but there's definitely was another moth that was i don't know it's kind of confusing there's something weirdly cyclical ring bring him to me so the moth is trying to bring uh you might have to go back out now no there's a little door right there is that what that is yeah wait wait is that like a little model of the lighthouse oh what the [ __ ] and there's a disc right there oh yeah so this is where he ascends the stairs the guy comes out when i was looking at the record player right you're remembering it tomorrow remembering what music was remember remember what the [ __ ] is your head it's just exposed brains that's what it kind of looks like oh it's okay take your time it's not like you catch him or anything there's gotta be a point to this there's gotta be a reveal i should be able to predict exactly where this dude's gonna go dude i'm like genuinely invested in this oh no i'm like that's down wait i hear him he's behind you it sounded like yeah oh that didn't oh no oh [ __ ] ago you found it oh did you just kill him yep oh and then you bring him down into that place no it's a moth hello oh you're in red land now [Music] oh it fell over what the [ __ ] are you can you do something here nope no i think it's just implying they're sitting there in shock oh that was the assistant or whatever the sudden no one lives under the lighthouse wow and what the [ __ ] that was pretty cool that was neat i liked it thanks mr zubkov i think that was just three guys made that game okay good game guys you did a good one yeah not bad guys okay no that was really good but um here's a thought for for your next one maybe don't make it look like it was so old yeah it's like like it's new yeah make it look like it's like a new game not an old game yeah also uh say i'd made it yeah say chris made it and then it'll be good thank you
