(EP. 2 ON AIR)
While you were active back in SNSD days, Q. Was there a memorable on-stage mistake you made? A lot actually What about you girls? (Asking back)
I'm sure you girls have that, right?😮 (Yuri tossing back the same question as her experienced senior) We do! And I do too! (Yeri's confession TIME about her mistakes)
On the very first show, everything went blank We practiced for our concert everyday and filmed pre-recordings early in the morning out of the blue It was this kind of movement Were you just standing there? lol (Malfunctioned because she got the choreography mixed up) A lot of people criticized me...😂 - I don't think that's even that bad~
- Really? Just how bad was your... (Back in my days)
I had to be a MC for a live broadcast You know hosts stand by below the stage (MC for a live broadcast must stand by below the stage)
and read cue cards to practice their lines and etc, right? while getting a make up and hair done and all that but (A 'sudden' countdown while Yuri was on stand by!)
It went like, 10 seconds, 8 seconds, 7, 6 out of the blue I was combing my hair and didn't hear that properly! But I was told to head up to the stage! Urgently! How...?? But I was holding a cue card on my left hand and a hair brush on my right hand... - AHAHAHAHAHA
- I was so disconcerted...lol (A master of filler words is curious about the settlement)
So how did you work that situation out??😮 Thankfully, I had 3 seconds (Fortunately, Yuri averted the embarrassing moment on camera)
before the show was on air so I changed the brush with a mic right away Then there's no footage of that? Fortunately, yes! (Failed to shoot a footage😅)
Ugh, we need that though~ Too bad Nah, I mean... There are a plenty of things like that anyway~ (Let's talk about one more~)
We're all the same, right? (SNSD's episode on stage clothes)
in terms of shoes we wear on stage and we can't be mixing shoes up otherwise we're in big trouble (because SNSD is a big group) (Master of filler words)
GASP↗ Totally! (The highlight of this episode : Long boots) I was wearing 240mm (US Size 6) on one side but the other side was way too small (That happened to me too!)
Omg! I feel you~ (Got the boots mixed up with Sunny)
I was wearing Sunny's 210mm (US Size 4) Like, half and half lol (Yuri's foot... I'm sorry...)
I looked to the left while dancing, and Sunny's other foot was way too big!! (LOOOOOL😄) (Back in my days)
( - The End - ) What's this?! This is... (Gotta give something in return when I got treated)
You treated this dish for me (Yeri's table d'hôte)
so I thought I had to give something for you in return - Really? What's this?
- This is that popular Yeri's table d'hôte I could say it's pretty famous... Hmm~ Where is this popular? (It began in some cooking show...) The theme was 'a dish we can cook with convenience store food' (Let's take a look first!) Open↗~ Hmm... (Pause) (Smell it first...) It's a hot sauce!! No no! This is chojang*!
*Korean spicy & sweet red chili pepper paste with vinegar (Gasp) Oh....Oh.....Really?... I used to love chojang With triangular kimbap* you can get in convenience stores
*Korean rice roll + fried eggs if you can make one + chojang + tuna + Instant black bean noodles You gather all that and mix them You mix it? Really? (Yeri's favorite recipe...☆)
I even made this at home too (The reason why Yeri's gotten interested in cooking) (The reason why Yeri's gotten interested in cooking = Yeri's table d'hote) 😲WUT?! (Hard to believe)
You said... You 'cooked' this... lol I mean, I cooked this! Right? Go ahead~ (Try it first)
I'll see how you eat this first~ Oh but, this is honestly really good I've had it a few times~ Even on camera~ Hey Yeri... Let's not meet on Yurihan Table*
*Yuri's cooking & recipe content in her YouTube channel  Let's just meet up by ourselves~ Come over to my dorm! (All good to go)
I'll give it a try~ Nom✨ (So...?👀) How is it...?? It's so good!! Really? - It does smell good! Whoa~
- String cheese~ You add cheese too~ And I'll top a slice of fried egg too~ A big bite Hmm~ Good! Hm↗mm↘ HA.HA (LOOOOOL) HA..HA.. That is a favorable response, eh? What? How? (LOOOOL🤣) Wait wait (Familiar and unfamiliar flavors) (Familiar and unfamiliar flavors, taking one more bite in between that realm.MOV) Hmm~ Let's have some tteokbokki* when you are feeling iffy
*Korean stir-fried rice cake Yeri's table d'hôte & Yeri's table d'hôte & Yurihan table's Yeri's table d'hôte & Yurihan table's collaboration✨ (Disapproved🚫)
I never said I would collab with you! First... It tastes...unique... (I'm sure it'll hover around in your head eventually) I think, in this! (There we go~)
(Star chef's supplement to boost Yeri's table d'hôte) (Chojang OUT Gochujang IN)
I think we could switch chojang to gochujang*~
*Korean red chili paste Gochujang~ But it's good, eh?! (Give me the answer I want) She doesn't say it's good whatsoever lol Is that it? I mean... Was that really necessary? (You didn't have to point that out...) But it's honestly good, no? (Give me the answer I want!! x2) (Hard to give an accurate answer)
Just... Wait a sec - She can't be eating like this if it's bad 
- It's not bad, because I mean... If Chapagetti* tastes bad, then you have to be punished!
*Instant black bean noodles The texture is weird... (Strike home🤛🏻)
Ah.... (Our Ddu Ddu is hurt😅) (Star chef's emergency measure🏥)
(Either add seasoned seaweed or pickled radish - Boost the texture) I think it's a good recipe when I'm in a rush! - It does taste good Yeri~
- I know, right?! (A belated consolation✨)
It's tasty~ (She finally said it's 'tasty'...♡)
It does taste good! Tasty~ (What Yeri wants on YouTube) It's good, right? It does taste good Yeri Ok, she said what I needed! So please ✂ out everything else (Instinct)
But this feels like a calorie bomb...Right? Um...Yeah... Those who are watching their weight should avoid it... - This is approximately 1,050 kcal...
- For 😲 real? (Actually very surprised...)
I think I had around 300kcal just now... lol But~ I think I'm glad you found a unique recipe I'm talented, eh? Hehe (Dull eyes)
Yep! But this.... You can't sell this! Just let me eat it You should NEVER sell it! I thank dear Yuri who joined the first Yerihan Mukbang with me today~ Q. How did you feel about Yerihan Bang? Seeing our super lovely Yerim who I met when she was 17 all grew up as a lady and now we're filming together like this~ - I even gave you a gift like this~
- I know! For me... An older sister... (Again, it's an astonishing appearance) (Look at this appearance filled with Yeri's heart for Yuri♡)
I even got a heartfelt gift😂 (Proud)
I'm thinking I lived my life well~ It was so fun and thank you so much for inviting me I wish Yerihan Bang becomes bigger, to 3,500, 7,000, and 10,500 sqft in size! (Con)Wishing Yerihan Bang's extension in the future(grats)

Are you nervous~? (Weekly Yerim) (✨Yerim's daily life)
(Let's try filming my daily photo shoot) (Yeri's true friend)
I'm at a photographer, Rie's house - I come here so often
- (Gosh~) that I could even call here my house You know I usually take a lot of photos I like my film camera so I carry it around with me too~ I take photos and upload it (!!Sharing for the first time ever!!)
I'll share~ my daily life with y'all today~ (Daily VJ = Yeri's true friend 'Rie') Oh, so pretty!! Really? The backlight makes you look gorgeous! (Checking the camera now)
(Super satisfied✨) (So gorgeous even in her daily look) I'm taking an album cover~ lol (We could actually use this as her new album cover!)
Hahaha! I'm releasing a new solo album~ (YERI's Solo 2nd)
('WEEKLY YERIM') For your information, Yerim rarely puts on a make up when she takes photos with me She only wears a lipstick Personally, I think Yerim is the prettiest when she has no make up on (Turning her back on the camera)
She's taking a mirror selfie~ But she's kinda awkward, eh? lol Oh!! Showing your weak side!! lol (Yerim, not Yeri, seems more conscious of the camera today)
I wasn't sure if I was doing it right~ I'm not a good photographer though - I mean, I love taking photos~
- Nah, you got your own vibes! (Not a good photographer, but I got my vibes.jpg) Yeah~~~ (Crash💥) (That's Yerim's daily energy level👍🏻)
This is my daily life everyone!! 📢YERIHAN BANG!!! (Let's start looking into Yerim's hobby life!) (A characteristic of Yeri's daily photo📸) (She already has lots of photos from photoshoots, so she prefers to take natural photos) Wow, so pretty~ OK~ Touch the camera naturally (Click📸 Click📸 ) Oh, great~ (What the... She's gorgeous in every photo...) Oh, that's the angle right now!) (Both her pose and the vibes are GOOD👍🏻)
Try bringing your hair up a little (☆Her daily life is a photo shoot☆) Alright, here comes a TIP for y'all! (Photographer-approved)
(The ①st pro TIP when taking a photo) If you want to take a photo with naturally blowing hair, we all have an electric fan at home, right? Don't turn it on at high speed (The point is the power level!) Around power level 2? (TIP①)
(Use an electric fan & turn it on at around power level 2 while taking a pose in the 'opposite' direction to the fan) (Like this) Let's try one more in that pose~ (A subtle wind produces the best scene...☆) (For a good photo)
I got changed~ (For the photo) I dressed up myself Please explain your apparel~ (I acknowledge your dedication for photos)
Umm, first of all I love this kind of tank top with thin straps 💗 A thin strap looks better on my body type + Paired with denim + Teddy bear hat I wore a cute hat today~ (Lula lala✨)
We'll take some photos now~ Rie) I got something to show off!! (Tada-🎁)
It's Yerim's gift! A photograph collection for me (Proud x2)
I gave her a photograph collection as a gift hehe It was truly touching~ Thank you!! Don't edit this part out🚫 (I didn't) (Photographer-approved)
(The ②nd pro TIP when taking a photo) (TIP② Use simple props at home to take photos with a natural vibe) Like this~ Like this~ 22 (An applied ver.) What you did just now was great! (The best photos in her daily life) (The best photos in her daily life - Very easy, eh?) (Bye) (Ddubai~ Bye bye) (See you next week🤍) (Yerim's Daily Life)
