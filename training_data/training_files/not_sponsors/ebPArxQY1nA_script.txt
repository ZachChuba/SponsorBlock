this episode and emogo is brought to you by story blogs we went up to space it was really hard to hold the camera your buddy Elon Musk at the end of the day what you're really doing is the same thing same basic tenants that take you through something small will take you through something big what's going on any mojo today I'm here with Jaron Friesland gerron's the cinematographer behind the movie of rampage but he's also work second unit DP on things like Star Wars looper today we're going to break down three scenes from rampage of course a big Hollywood movie talked a little bit about not only the script but also the camera and lenses and lighting and then finally any secret sauce that you may be added to each of these scenes and little special things demanded that might have spice me up a little bit you ready I've never been more ready how was the experience of shooting rampage those me and Brad paid in the director one of the things he demands of everybody is that you have a strong opinion and these are actually user control a buret of process what's the biggest difference between working the indie projects the student film guys to jumping up to a higher level working with the rock and kind of a bigger production team politics you know obviously like with more money there's they're more toys that you can play with there's more ways you could approach a problem to solve it yeah but sometimes when you have limitations it forces you in the creative place those limitations will make you find a better solution you start with the story and what the visual storytelling should be so we have three scenes here three different movie scenes that we think of come kind of easier tartar of our scene we have so this is this bamboo forest that we shot in outside of Atlanta Atlanta we believe they're going in the forest in some far-off jungle and they're following this this crazy guy and what we reveal throughout the course of this is that they're actually coming into the zoo so but how are you shot before it actually looked like this that's what you were thinking of that you were thinking I need this to look the inspiration for it was the opening of Indiana Jones where Harrison Ford is making his way through that through the jungle you don't really know what's happening and so that was the ideas like let's start out with this really creepy space and then let's eventually reveal this like more happy-go-lucky San Diego Wildlife Sanctuary the interesting thing here is that this son was on the entirely wrong side of this set the bamboo forest is on this is on this hill yeah and so you got all the bamboo and there is a parking lot right here we can't look this way towards the parking lot which would be the obvious way to look so that it's backward so the fun is that because the Sun does this at this location so in order to shoot into the forest then we actually had to make our own Sun we put a few area maxes so that we would be set up with wherever we needed like the big light and so we use that to be be our Sun and then we hung blacks we hung blocks and 20 buys in the forest to block someone with a career through but what that meant is that we had a ton of control over what you know wherever we wanted the Sun to come from we could actually make it be what we wanted it to be one of the things that is similar on every project is you're still up against the time crunch you still have limitations at the time money you know manpower let's say that the Sun went went like this you know then what we could do instead of putting lights up here is we could time our shots for time of day and say okay well we're gonna shoot the shot of Dwayne when he's over here so the sun's over and that's the bud and then we're gonna shoot the reverse walking with those gears every good start to Lake yeah you're gonna start to play with where the Sun is even if we had had the Sun there you probably would still putting some lights there because you don't know can't say oh we just just couldn't get that shot of Dwayne the rock is out so to achieve that how did you approach in terms of camera in terms of lenses so the whole film was shot on an Alexa is shooting anamorphic so four by three standard a brad had a real deep connection with movies of his youth that were all shot anamorphic so that automatically drove us towards that direction for all of the idiosyncrasies that that anamorphic lenses carry 50 millimeter most Ananya we used 50 millimeter on the a it was like like 80% seventy that's a lot it's such a like a ton of the movie I know that back on the fifth and that's normal is that you kind of find you find your something on the the main qualities that I look for are clarity what the focus looks like when it is focused how well can it handle flare if you slam a lens slam a light right down the lens how much does the image fall apart can I still put somebody in the foreground with a flaring light straight over their shoulder can I still see their face I need to now know that if we're gonna do that lens then those are the those limitations got to work with right I'm gonna draw me a rock right here this is the rock here's our camera okay it's beautiful right it's a really good camera I think just like that and then we would put on the same side as the key this back let's say let's kind of silhouettes him a little bit and then this tells a man yeah so and we had a 12 by bleached mozz mm-hmm and we had to sky panels and this was the first show that I ran in tirely XY whatever like any lights that we could run XY I Love Lucy light a nerd did what does exploit it references the CIE Telegraph right so you saw an X x-axis variable and Y axis variable give you a specific color I used a spectrometer it'll read out an XY coordinate we can put that XY into the sky panel it'll produce this the exact same color so it's giving me the value of the green comes the green ambience coming down from the Sun filtered smooth the green leaves you know coming hitting the ground yeah then we added that into the the fill so we can see on the back here that kind of glint on his head that's mostly coming from the backlight the automatics is so right here we've added a 12 by just to add in a little bit more light wraps around secret sauce Jaron I don't know if I would call it secret sauce Oh more call it like just something that I do film print emulation does the camera get enough information to map it to where the values would be if we had shot film and content printed for every show I build a lot it's a single show lot for the show it may vary slightly but it's based in a print emulation so it's matching bits with digital quality of an Alexa and trying to match it a little bit more into traditional film and the way that I would look at exactly exactly yeah and then on top of it there's really a lot to be said for adding grain to digital images if you were to take a digital image and look at it with and without grain just so dark by themselves this is where you're gonna say no way this shot that doesn't have grain will look less sharp by making with Western yeah looks more sure you are degrading the high contrast edges but you're also putting into the areas that are uniform no you're giving a texture and your eye sees it as something to grab on to too that says that's sharp not heavy popcorn grain but like a nice like some kind of grain that you would actually use and what it does it gives an organic feel to the thing moving on to our next scene here we go so this is where they're gonna they're they're going into Chicago to go try and fight the giant monsters this entire sequences of obviously a ton of the effects everything that we shot inside the helicopters was done on the on stage all green screen so what yeah what it was is what we did was we built a dome I think we had camera member was 80 or 120 sky panels and they're all gonna have um we have another cell hold on we would have these these frames let's say this is a side view each frame you know has some keep they have eight you see you'd have these things and these are on chain motors yeah and then they could they could pull out so then you had a dome of those we took this is the sky panels looking good down there was something like eight years I can't remember specific so these are now just individual sky panels these are the top so now if you looked at the side cut out you would have a thing like that this is this is the silk and now you would have you know sky panels sky panels and then these frames of sky panels so this is there and this is there and then in the middle was the the gimbal which is a six axis gimbal many students actually use this time to finish your step panel monster here this goes all the way around - yeah then you have this is now all these guy panels are mapped you have this white space that you can shoot anywhere in right now you can color control the light to be anything No inside the dome we put the dwell Cape are due on a crane that we could then shift around to be the Sun the world is a warm Sun and a cool sky if you do take a color meter and you actually meter the Sun and then meter just the sky you'll see the difference so this is like ambient sky you basically down cooler this is of course a hurry two hundred you come in like yeah these are all green screen shots right so we put green screen behind the helicopter wherever we need whatever so that the majority of the background is covered in green okay so let's say we're shooting a shot here it's more like that's so because you need the light coming anymore we want all the ambient light coming this is one sky I created these lat/long videos so javi do that's a ball the videos had blockers essentially negatives that would go and fly around the dome so that it replicated like buildings they wouldn't have this was your spherical video you would have like a black solid just like fly through randomly one of the things that I that I did for all of this and you have to work if you want it to look right is you have to work in ratios letting loose lighting ratios so if you go out and you meter the Sun the Sun is it might be a stopover what you're gonna set your lens at and the ambient sky will be two to three stops down mm-hmm one up two down but it's so easy not to subscribe to those ratios on a stage and they get complicated when you get inside a vehicle yeah right because now it's like it's not the sun's coming through but you actually got negative because the the sky is blocked by the vehicle and if you don't subscribe to it yeah it won't look as real 90 percent of the time when you do when you have a car the background is too dark if you're exposing inside a vehicle for people the backgrounds gonna be pretty pretty bright try to get a reference you know go shoot somebody in a car on a prep day or whatever just like shoot a piece so that I can send something through to to the compositors to say hey this is kind of what it looks like it is super easy it's like just pull the green screen for a second we should roll a little and then stick the green skin back in and if you can get any information you can give the effects yes so helpful I mean every time there's an animal we have we had the fur and we just stick the fur in front of camera before we break down our last scene I have a huge shout out to story blogs for sponsoring this video as an educational filmmaking channel we basically have the show behind the scenes footage of home sets like all the time and sadly we do not have the time to go visit some set every single day instead we rely on story vlogs to get high quality footage of Cinematographers with cameras on their shoulders and so far they have not it's pointed the story blocks video starts at about 1658 a month for unlimited downloads and all of it is royalty-free south stop spending too much money on stock footage head on over the story of life's calm slash Indy mogul and now back to the episode all right for this last scene we pulled this one I'm super excited about this is actually the first theme in the movie tell us what's going on in the scene so there's the the company that is developing the technology to make these animals into crazy attack beasts they can't do this experimentation on earth so they've gone to space the experimentation has gone horribly awry it's one astronaut is trying to get out and they will not let her so without your specimen so what did you see in the script the reference for all of this the space station work was alien but it wanted to have a bit more of like current day a modern where we're in the space station we looked at a bunch of space station you know images and whatnot where my head was going was all practically driven no lighting like so if we've got you know a tunnel if there's a panel of light here then we would have just a little bit of dim rap coming here right the entire set on this is proxy so the only thing that's real is where her hands touch and everything else is just like kind of ray boxes telling me that none of this well it's actually like so the door exists in real life any lights that she passes by that are practicals those also exist those also exists because they have to wrap exactly exactly right where's you the door let's say it's okay so this is our door that thing that she pushed is a panel that's like a piece of set that is real but it's not that piece it's like a grey it's like a gray piece that she can push down there just like grey polygons on set yeah but she just touches and if there were specific stuff that we wanted a green screen in we would put little green screens around those panels all those panels are there this little light up on the left those are actually LED strips behind diffuser there's a department that falls into a little bit of our department a little bit of lighting and it's called fixtures the fixtures department if these are the sets where do we want these to be if we know that that our actress is gonna stop here and push this thing down right and we want to see that in a certain way so because we know that she wants to she's gonna stop there maybe I'll say let's quick let's have one of these here and if these are gonna be evenly lit if that'll forces this one over then so be it because this one is more important to me and then I'll put a little low panel here so this one you'll sneak in to set for a close-up yes like a sweet will see like right there she went by this light up here that's not I don't have that built into the light into the set I have that light in her if she doesn't cross it it doesn't need to be real so that was that was probably a like one of our lights with the effects work you have to start at the end and then work your way back for example we're shooting the scene at the end of the movie and it's George falling on this pile of rubble and and Duane's looking up at him talking well he's fallen on pile of rubble that's at the bottom of a big building so I can't have light coming this way on join because there's a big building there I first think about the world and then think about shots that can exist within that world and then we build those shots the hard part with this set I mean the real real challenge was that if I want her to be silhouetted against something yeah the to proxy said I have to still light the set when it's when you have a real set you can you can say okay that's gonna be this dim murkiness and she'll be black in front of dim murky with when it's proxy you're like you just you need to be like okay well I just want what level of intensity do I want her at and then a discussion whether the effects are is to say the effects supervisor to say at that point this is the idea here what about tons when there are these explosions that are happening in the corridors little explosions we had little panels little LED panels that we would we would play through a little clip of burning it would have like it would just be doing like a little explosion and that'll give you the light a little bit of light the big explosions are we would have a series of sky panels and they would be lighting like there's no end on this right it would just it just went off no and there was we would put a 12 I think was like good bunch of sky panels behind it we could program the sky panels to do an explosion of fact and then they would taint and change over to green my green so the big comes greens good so you're saying that okay you know sky panels you in the shot because this right here yeah yeah because we want the wrap of the explosion as they come as she comes away from it now we want it to be like whatever they want to composite back there on this though are you ever concerned about green light though spilling into usually but remember it's going against an entirely proxy set that they're gonna replace that's all gonna be replaced anyways so it's not a huge deal you gotta start at the end I think that's awesome people won't ask you questions or anything like that okay yeah Jerry stock up even better yes there you have it a breakdown of studio and VFX filmmaking with a chair and press on I wanna give a huge thank you to Jaron for actually coming out and talking to us about the cinematography secrets that's all to thank story blocks again for sponsoring this video so make sure you head on over to the link in the description and give them some love honestly the channel would not be possible without people like story Bloods also just so you know we also have a podcast episode with Jaron will actually go even more into detail for each scene for what it was like the film rampage so if we instead checking that out we'll leave that in the description down below as well but that is it for me guys I'm Ted thanks for watching any moment - just swap the whole camera we know he knows deep SD cards loser swap for camera we have 12 of those tiny cameras in the slough of that
