everyone knows the iPhone 11 pros of a sexy interesting ones so why are we leading a review coverage with the sub care model if you have to ask that you probably don't know much about the iPhone 11 under the hood it's got exactly the same guts as the pro and pro Mac's right down to the CPU and RAM and the display area is right in the middle between the two but it isn't significantly heavier than the smaller Pro it also gets a dual rear camera configuration and a $50 price drop compared to last year's 10r but why [Music] competition is a hell of a drug isn't it today's sponsor private Internet access has you covered if you've got plenty of competition looking for an affordable and reliable VPN private Internet access encrypts your Internet traffic and use a safe protected IP check it out today through the link below the moment you compare its screen against its pro cousin the difference is striking while the liquid Retina Display introduced on the previous generation iPhone 10 our isn't poor by any standard it simply cannot compete with the contrast that sharpness afforded by the pros XD our OLED display that's not to say it's bad though compared to an older iPhone or a lesser LCD based phone caller accuracy and contrast are still significantly improved there is one glaring deficiency though how could anyone even consider a screen that's less than 1080p in 2019 well if you use the 10r you'll know that a 326 PPI Ronn resolution doesn't really matter as much as you think it does the TLDR here is that mobile oh let's typically have 1/3 fewer sub pixels that make up the image than LCD in an arrangement called pin tile and at a given resolution may appear patchy by comparison that's why comparing the 11 and 11 Pro resolution directly isn't useful rest assured you won't be seeing any individual pixels in daily use you will notice the knotch though while some at this point may not care or even prefer a notch to just having a chin and while Apple may have a sophisticated sensor suite in their knotch this is a problem that has already been solved and there are now multiple phones on the market with under screen fingerprint sensors pop up cameras and speakers that don't require a long grille built into the face of the display to add insult to injury here at the bezel around the display itself is thick enough to be distracting if you've used anything with a slimmer or more modern display but coming from an iPhone 6s it's honestly no bigger than what I'm used to and given the 10r was apples best selling 10 series phone it clearly wasn't a huge factor for those customers an apple stung a lot right here aside from their trademark UI responsiveness there are certainly a few other nice touches here that really game-changers but help keep the experience more streamlined than before tapped awake is one feature I Loki love about Android and it's finally made an appearance an iDevice meaning I don't need to pick up my phone and tilt it every time I have to check my notifications anymore and whether you love them or hate them you can now peer a pair that's two pairs of ear pods or Beats headphones which is great for like watching the movies watching the movies yes go watch some of them those that the movies and of course there's the standard checklist of things we come to expect from modern smartphones like wireless charging gigabit LTE dual SIM Wi-Fi six support etc etc speaking of stuff all modern smartphones have the camera was a bit hitter is for me on the one hand it's every bit as good as the iPhone 11 pros all be it without the telephoto camera that's been triggering a lot of trip a phobia there's a lot of detail here and in photos like this flower the note 10 by comparison does a terrible job but in many other cases it seems like apples processing is sometimes a bit too aggressive when it comes to making colors pop and musingly sometimes goes the exact opposite direction casting a solid tone across the whole image and desaturating details as in this image of Canada place where we hosted LTX in 2019 there's some heavy image sharpening going on here and it's especially noticeable in this shot with flow planes look closely at the wing struts and propellers and it gets more aggressive with noise reduction making this shot almost look like the pavement is experiencing motion blur from camera shake despite everything else being sharp ironically the note tends version of this image is less noisy while still retaining detail in natural noise like this and check out the legibility of the branding on this SUV most importantly results can vary dramatically depending on how the camera app behaves these two images look similar but zoom in and suddenly one is detailed and the other is not now none of this is to say if the cameras are garbage you do need to zoom in to tell the difference most of the time and some may prefer the sharpened look but you may want to use a third-party camera app capable of shooting raw to get the best out of your iPhone 11 whether it's a pro or not whatever the choice Apple still doesn't have a screen off camera so if you store area51 again next year you'll probably miss the UFOs as they're taking off quick tech video is a huge blessing though and that means you no longer need to fumble between shooting stills and shooting video if the camera apps already open that's a feature Samsung actually removed from there's something I'm sure Linus is going to wind more about in the upcoming review of the iPhone 11 Pro Max and Galaxy fold man that's a mouthful iPhone 11 pro max make sure your sub so you don't miss them for now it's time to talk about the slow fee it's a stupid word and like so many others Apple related terms of the years I'm still mad of a podcast but I'm mad enough to admit that it amused me when I tried it I do question the longevity of it as a social media meme but hey a faster front-facing camera is a faster front-facing camera no complaints there LTT swore calm if I over slow for your friends bringing us to the battery life can it keep up with its pro cousin does it do what Apple says it does on the tin well yeah actually with a capacity of just over 3100 milliamp hours it'll comfortably get you through your day especially thanks to Apple's trademark software and hardware optimizations but make no mistake this is no two-day phone and you'll want to plug it in at night a worst case scenario Geekbench for battery life test with the screen brightness at 50% lasted a decent 6 hours and 24 minutes from full to empty about an hour longer than the 10r that's great though it does still mean that if you're a gamer or like to edit video in law you might want to keep a wireless charger nearby or by the sold seperately type see a lightning cable and an 18 watt charger to top-up midday something the pro models do come with so when all is said and done is the 11 sub here what are you actually getting for your extra $300 with the iPhone 11 Pro smaller bezels and extra camera a fast charger and an OLED display Apple advertises an extra two meters of water resistance but unless you drop your phone in the swimming pool that's not likely to matter I suppose if you need 512 gigabytes of storage and a mobile device you don't really have much of a choice but that's really it the other difference is just boil down to what color you want and whether you care about having a stainless steel versus aluminum for the housing well ok then it snaps up here should you buy the iPhone 11 well if you were considering the pro then yeah you get a wider array of color options a larger screen unless you're looking at a max and you get the same cuts at a much more reasonable price point it's actually kind of hilarious how Apple bends over backwards to differentiate them on the product page and even more hilarious is that they let you choose older models to compare the iPhone 6s plus for example has no design and no 64 gigabyte variant so everyone who bought one of those like me has been hallucinating for the past four years of their lives as for those of you who aren't already in the ecosystem this desperation to make the 11 exciting exemplifies the problem at Apple right now they haven't truly innovated on their iPhone hardware designs in some time now and they're failing to differentiate in the face of androids ever-increasing maturity features like touch ID and 3d touch have been cut they're copying other multi camera designs while their image processing and quality in general falls behind the competition to say nothing of Google assistants overtake of Siri and the carplay versus Android auto debate being virtually non-existent Apple consistently boasts the fastest mobile processors on release though and iphones enjoy consistent long-term support so as we discussed in our previous we think buying an iPhone is a great idea if you want a phone that's going to receive updates and hold its value for a long time it's just ironic that this consumer-friendly quality makes being a holdout extremely easy aside from the fact that my iPhone 6s is nearing the end of life in iOS there wouldn't really be a compelling reason for me to upgrade today and I think that is the real conclusion Apple has some innovating to do as we observed in our review of the Asus dual screens and Book Pro duo go check that one out and also check out ENCOM and get $25 off your phone bill thanks for watching guys come back soon y'all
