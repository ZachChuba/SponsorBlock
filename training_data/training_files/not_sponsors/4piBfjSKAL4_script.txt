sh / polyphonic xi will get two months of Skillshare for free there are a few rappers that can compare to a sob rock well he's never broken through the mainstream his intricate flow and strange verbose bars have made him an underground hip-hop legend he's always in the discussion of smartest rappers of all time and when Matt Daniels analyzed hip hop's vocabulary he left all other rappers in the dust Daniels found that Aesop Rock used more than 7,000 different words in his songs nearly a thousand more than the next rapper so how does Aesop Rock do it let's take a closer look each one of a sock rock songs contains so much density that it would be nearly impossible to look over as entire catalogue so to better understand how we make such unique music I'm gonna look at what maybe is most popular song none shall pass released in 2007 none shall pass is the title track off Aesop's best-selling record it provides a great entry point for the artist because it shows off everything that he does so well in four minutes of music Aesop Rock manages to squeeze in an impressive 258 different words if you don't count the hundred most common words in the English language you still have 221 different words for some context Bob Dylan is one of the most verbose songwriters in rock history when we look at his masterpiece like a rolling stone a dense song by any measure uses a hundred eighty eight unique words 137 if you take away the common ones and that's a six minute song Aesop Rock manages to fit nearly twice that in four minutes when you take out the instrumental passages samples and chorus repetitions you get around 105 seconds of actual rapping that means in each second of rapping Aesop Rock fits in more than two individual words and that's not including the most common words either it things like that now this is impressive but being able to fit a lot of different words in a song doesn't necessarily mean the words make sense in fact both Bob Dylan and Aesop Rock have been criticized for how difficult it can be to parse their language with some people claiming there's no meaning just jumbled words in an interview with Guernica Aesop Rock denied this though he said these songs are not nonsensical that's pretty preposterous I'd have to be a genius to pull this many nonsensical records over people's eyes he elaborated in Rolling Stone saying that if people aren't pulling meaning from his songs then that's on them he said I feel like if people aren't pulling anything from the songs then they're not really trying to or didn't have an interest in the first place and the fact that you need to try to pull meaning from Aesop Rock is part of what makes them so amazing in my book it's an active listening process trying to decipher what he's saying and how it can affect your life and there's a lot to decipher when you look closely the first few couplets of none shall pass give direction for the song it's a contemplation on the state of culture and modern society at the time of its release but the way that ace goes about this is with dense metaphor buttery gold is a way of talking about wealth and it's dripping with visual imagery but he pairs this image of flaunting wealth with a jittery zeitgeist the zeitgeist is a term often associated with the German philosopher Hegel it means the spirit of an age so what's Aesop Rock saying when he says the spirit of our age is jittery it's a nervous time insecure and distracted paired with the images of buttery gold creates a juxtaposition people are flaunting their wealth but the national spirit is insecure and nervous and that's just two lines you can see why unpacking ace is such an intense process he speaks almost entirely in metaphor the end of none shall pass his first verse is one of my favorite sections of a song where he discusses the way that society is played against itself the shop Rock has an incredible way of using common euphemisms and turning them on their head most people know what a cash cow is and know it beef is in hip-hop both of these metaphors relate to cows and Aesop Rock notices this and ties them together to make a powerful statement those in power are making money off of people fighting each other this flows effortlessly into the next line condemning police violence and tying neatly back into the metaphor of beef painting a dark picture of authority feasting on the struggles of the downtrodden the dense verbose verses of none shall pass are paired with a simple pre-chorus and a hook built mostly around instrumentals and samples [Music] [Applause] Aesop Rock said that he came up with that idea upon hearing Blockheads beat to the song he wanted the course to be simple built around a catchy phrase that phrase none shall pass holds many meanings within itself though on one level it seems to suggest hip-hop bravado but at the same time it could be a reference to a Monty Python clip and this goes hand-in-hand with the rest of the chorus where a Saints judgment by a funhouse cast the song is lush with religious imagery and this chorus about judgment seems to lampoon the idea of people claiming moral authority over each other this condemnation of people in power and authority bleeds into the next verse what Aesop Rock says here is actually a common thought especially in hip-hop the privilege can't relate to those who have had to struggle to get where they are but the way he paints this picture is so clever and unique the privileged are referred to as people who have never had a day a snowcone [ __ ] fix it's a simple image but a powerful one and from there Aesop Rock sings of an underground rapper compares him to a broken motor barely running because he refuses to submit to the standards demanded by mainstream society it's clearly a personal story for Aesop Rock who has spent his entire career proudly in the underground and while his music may not have the same mainstream appeal it's still easy enough to listen to Aesop Rock without delving into the lyrics and that in and of itself is a feat they stopped called The Rolling Stone that he learned how to fill songs with the broad vocabulary but still make them easy to listen to and perform he said I think I've learned over time to keep the denseness and the lexicon in there while making it something that's easier to perform and maybe isn't working against the listeners ear as much a lot of praise is put on how difficult songs are to rap but none shall pass has a simple steady flow laid-back and right on top of the beat [Music] part of the reason a sapa rocks music is so listenable is the way that internal rhyme guides his flow this is something he learned from his influences look at Eric sermons opening verse on coming at you see how he rhymes back with attack and sharp with barb nestling these little rhymes within a couplet it's no coincidence that Aesop Rock told passion vice that this verse always stuck in his head but ace takes this to the next level on none shall pass in the middle of the second verse he stacks internal rhymes and pairs them with alliteration check out how this couplet strings together lines of s sounds followed by lines of C sounds all while the rhymes provide a consistent rhythm and these intricately crafted rhymes contain just as much meaning as the rest of the song there a condemnation of conformity in an interview with trasher Aesop Rock talked about how he writes his rhymes I'll hear things throughout my day that I'd like to work into a song and write it down whether I get to it tomorrow or two years from now I know it'll be on that list this comes through clearly in the third verse - none shall pass where he runs common phrases and images together with pop culture and raw human experience he even breaks up his flow into clear thoughts playing with space in the bar so that you can hear each thought both on its own and as part of a wider mess [Music] the way Aesop Rock crafts his bars around the beat is impressive too he's able to nestle short punchy lines in with long intricate descriptive passages a sub rock is the full package not only does he have a vocabulary that many authors would die for he has a command over it he can wrangle it into a flow that can connect with listeners and none shall pass is really just the entrance point Aesop Rock has an entire career of songs to prove why he's one of the greatest rappers ever to live but if you decide to give it a listen you might want to bring up thesaurus [Music]
