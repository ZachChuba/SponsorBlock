quote the unicorn is many things no two people will see the same unicorn the one may be seen by many mortals see it and call it shy fears proud free the spirit of magic the spirit of unconformity the symbol of purity truth change goodness chaos innocence grace beauty secrecy and a thousand other things there is truth in each of these but each of them alone is not enough and all the words that could be spoken would not a unicorn describe the unicorns are the stuff of myths magical fantastical creatures that dwell in enchanted forests their white form glimmering like starlight suffice to say a physical description is not necessary for everybody knows what a unicorn is to put it to simply basically a horse with a horn though that's that's not true at all actually in fact a unicorn is actually closer to a chimera than a horse for they're actually combination of a small number of animals even if you might not see it at first but before we start on raveling this creature let's actually go through first what the Monster Manual actually tells us about unicorns first things first they tell us that unicorns have a single spiraling horn of ivory whose magical touch can heal the sick and injured it's us here that its ears catch the words and whispers of the creatures that share its domain it allows good-hearted creatures to enter their woods to hunt or gather food but they hold evil ever at bay it goes on to say that unicorns many times over are placed there by gods meant to ward away evil and preserve and protect sacred places sometimes they're sent to guard a specific artifact but sometimes they're sent to aid and protect a person these gods tend to be de DS of the forest including really powerful Fae Lords those unicorns who do happen to serve these nature gods faithfully are rewarded with abilities like being able to cast clerics spells it expands here and what they already touched on where they say that the unicorns know everything that happens in its forest every single tune that is song every word that is spoken every single caterpillar the spins is cocoon and every butterfly that flutters its wings the unicorn sees it all there is a pervasive calmness in the forest all the animals within tend to be tame and all the Sylvan creatures of the forest serve the unicorn and helping protect this calmness it says here that the Horn of the unicorn is sacred and it is the focus of its power a shard of divine magic wrought in spiral in ivory ones of unicorn horn shadow powerful magic while unicorn horn weapons strike with divine force wizards can work powdered unicorn horn into potent potions and scroll ink or use that as a component in eldritch rituals lastly it says here that when darkness and evil threatened to overwhelm the mortal world the gods sometimes see it fit to pair a unicorn mount with a champion a paladin astride a unicorn is a sign of the gods direct intervention in the affairs of the mortal realm now we have some extra effects that the presence of the unicorn provides in the forest which are incredibly interesting like the fact that open flames of a nun magical nature are extinguished within the unicorns domain creatures inside of the forest can hide easily from others and healing spells are stronger within the forest when the source is good-hearted lastly curses affecting good people are suppressed while within the forest we can also see in a stat block that unicorns have a plethora of abilities not just from natural and clear expels but from the horn itself more importantly is the teleport ability which the unicorns description did not actually cover in fact the unicorn has had the ability to teleport since the first edition of Dungeons and Dragons and it's teleport ability is actually quite stronger than the conventional one but we will cover that in just a bit let's go and actually see what the Monster Manual does not tell you about unicorns the first thing that we will cover is the physical description of the unicorn which we don't really get the only thing that the Monster Manual actually says is that it resembles a horse and it does I mean look at it it basically does look like a horse but artists renditions don't tell the whole story we actually have to go into the actual official description of the unicorn to see how they actually behave and how different they really are from horses see the first thing is detail a unicorns don't actually have horse tails instead their tail is supposed to look like this this is the original unicorn as it was shown and described in the first edition it's not just here though this is how it looked in 3rd edition as well the Unicorn is described as having the tail of a lion or a boar not the tail of a horse now the monster manual does show you this one but their chin is supposed to have the beard of a goat what they don't tell you is that only male unicorns have the beard in fact it is mainly the only way to really tell a male unicorn from a female and that is whether they have the beard or not now this part is interesting unicorns have cloven hoofs which is not what horses have this is what a horse hoof looks like and this is a cloven hoof cloven hoofs is what cattle deer sheep and goats have and it is what unicorns have not to summarize unicorns might look like horses from a simple point of view but in reality they have parts from many different animals scattered in their body unbeknownst to many people the crazy thing though is that I still haven't told you the biggest one yet a unicorn and this is gonna blow your mind the snot gallop a unicorn does not run like a horse does instead they trot like deer do with those prancing like hops that you have probably seen yes that's how unicorns move through the forest in fact it is stated that the trots and skips of a unicorn can be high enough to completely go over a full human now going even further with our description we're told that when the light of the Sun reflects off of their horn it actually creates a bit of a prismatic effect creating rainbow hues that spread across the glade we're also told that one of the most interesting things about them is that they don't really have a defined eye color adventurers who claim to have seen the same unicorn always have different descriptions of their eyes and most claim to actually not remember what their eye color was in reality the eye color of a unicorn changes all the time sometimes even whilst you're looking at it but other than that descriptions differ depending on the unicorn some unicorns have silver or golden hoofs sometimes different colors the same thing with the mane it is many times different and it is dependent on the unicorn as far as the body hair color is concerned though most unicorns are white but there have been reports of gray silver and gold as well the thien's from faroan have actually managed to corrupt unicorns using demonic blood and dark rituals turning otherwise normal unicorns into black unicorns these ones look like normal unicorns except that they're black and they're bloodthirsty and wholly evil their horns instead of being conduits to healing are conduits to pain and misery interestingly enough the black unicorns are actually a big part of the Fae in military with them having entire battalions of unicorn riders now in spite of their mystique and powers if you look at the stat block for the unicorn you will see that they're not geniuses in fact their intelligence it's actually pretty average this is probably one of the most jarring things about actually meeting a fabled unicorn is that when you actually speak to it many actually come out of that conversation not being particularly impressed with the intelligence of the creature in fact many sages in the world claimed that as well if you were to read about a unicorn in a library in Ferren it would say that they're not smart at all the thing about unicorns is that they don't really know much about the human world or really much about what's going on outside of the forest even simple things like how to make bread or how to make a campfire would actually be difficult for the unicorn to process in the same way that it would probably be for a normal person who has never actually made bread or made a campfire in the first place let alone an average human who has lived its entire life in the forest trying to have an intelligent conversation with a unicorn about things from outside of the forest it's a fool's errand you're not really gonna get much from that on the other hand if you were to ask the right questions things could be completely different quote their knowledge is not of building fires and laying stone but of the nature of living things the wisdom learned from watching the Stars pass in the night the endless cycle of nature repeated again and again yet differently every time they know what is in the heart of a man or a woman and can read meaning into the turn of the wind the fall of a leaf the sigh of a child meanings no one else knows Deadly they love secrets and dearly they keep them and quote they obtained his wisdom not just through their celestial powers but by being exceptionally old in fact no one actually knows how old a unicorn can actually live for for it has never been catalogued many elves have heard stories from their ancestors about unicorns that they still see nowadays out there in the wild meaning that unicorns live far longer than elves do and as far as dryads Pixies sprites and the like are concerned unicorns have always been there in fact creatures of the forest will tell you that the only ones who are possibly older than the unicorns are the treants but not even they remember that far back in time to be able to factually say not even a unicorn itself would be able to tell you how old it is for not even they know time works differently for a unicorn that it does for a human see if time means little to an elf who lives for so long it literally means nothing to a unicorn who seemingly seems to live forever that compiled with the fact that a unicorn experiences life differently than a mortal I mentioned it before in the last quote but a unicorn will always experience something unique whenever it experiences an event regardless of how many times it has experienced that event a unicorn could watch the same movie a thousand times and each time it would feel unique and new to it because it would always see new things in every scene this is one of the natural celestial powers of the unicorn that allows it to see the wonders of the world in a new form every single time so to a unicorn every day is unique and special and there is no repetition and no mundaneness what this actually translates to in terms of time management is that the unicorn literally has none the unicorn has no concept of time in fact it has been plainly stated that a unicorn would not be able to tell you a week as fast if you were to ask it it is also interesting that unicorns don't really age either as in they don't particularly show signs of how old they really are at least they don't for 99% of their lifespan instead the only age when they are weeks away from dying it is when they are at the very cusp of death that they will start showing signs of aging going down sickness and fatigue it is of course until they actually do die now unicorns do mate and they do reproduce and when they do they mate for life they also reproduce in the way that you would expect a horse or a deer to do it it's the same thing thing is this is one of the rarest things that you would ever experience I mean again we don't even know how old a unicorn can get and they might only reproduce once or twice during their lifetime so actually experiencing a new unicorn being born well yeah entire generations of elves would go by before you would even hear of one but when it does happen it is said that there are riot like celebrations all around the forest now let's talk about hobbies I mean what do unicorns do when they're just relaxing in the forest well first of all they eat they are herbivores so they eat grass and honeysuckle sweet roots and bark what's really interesting is that if for some reason food were to be scarce which sounds impossible for the most part but if it were to be the case it is described that unicorns have the special ability to actually obtain sustenance from the air itself to an onlooker it would look as if the unicorn was drinking the wind the favorite places for unicorns to relax under are places with still ponds the types of ponds that would reflect light this is because unicorns are exceptionally vain creatures and one of their favorite things to do is literally just to look at the reflection they love to gaze upon themselves and admire themselves other than that they Scout their forests and protect it that's basically what they do most of the time a typical unicorn or family of unicorn will etch out a territory of approximately 400 square miles that's 20 miles by 20 miles and in that territory they will etch out and carved out runes into the trees these runes can be read by Sylvan creatures and it will denote that the forest is under the unicorns protection the runes are typically enough to ward off evil faor other bad entities into entering the forest lest they anger the Unicorn in fact once a forest has been claimed by a unicorn or a family of unicorn no other unicorn will enter the forest either the area that they generally protect is fairly big but an interesting power of the unicorn is his ability to cover extremely long distances in a single sprint see a unicorn strength is almost endless it is said that they can run for days with a tiring at full speed and with their trotting they can pass through even the densest of forests without a problem even dragons tire after flying for a day but a unicorn can go for many in fact a popular saying amongst humanoids is chasing the unicorn in references someone who is wasting their time and catching the unicorn to mean someone trying to do the impossible other than these things a unicorn actually enjoys making friends with the woodland creatures but it is generally fairly picky with who it relates to for the most part the unicorn feels closest with elves and fairies who the unicorn will converse with many times over to a lesser extent a unicorn will still be fairly friendly with the treants dry yet satyrs nymphs Pixies and sprites who will get to see the unicorn fairly regularly but apart from those for the most part no one else will really ever get to see the unicorn even if you are a kind-hearted person the unicorn will do its best to generally stay away having the unicorn show itself to you is considered to be a huge blessing and something to actually feel honored by that being said there is a catch now everyone in the forest knows if you were to ask a dryad or a pixie that there is a type of person that the unicorn is more likely to show itself to and that is little girls or well at least the stories go that little girls have an unnaturally way higher chance of meeting the fabled unicorn though the reality is that this is actually the case for any made that being any female virgin whether young or old actually has a way higher chance of meeting the unicorn in fact it goes even further whenever a unicorn is feeling particularly lonely it may appear to a maid and girl of good heart and if this happens the unicorn may allow itself to be ridden by the woman if she accepts and is respectful about it a powerful magical bond will be formed between the two the all will be the unicorns Ryder and the unicorn will be her majestic steed and until the end of her life the unicorn will be with her the bond will be strong enough that the unicorn will be more than happy to even leave its forests if the woman rider were to ask it - the bond will last until the end of her life or until the moment the woman sees herself as the master of the unicorn which is a big no-no or until the moment she stops being good of heart now this part you actually might have not known but a unicorn will only ever allow a girl to ride it never a man and when she chooses the maiden woman she will not let any other girl ride it either this interesting factoid is also the case for the dark black unicorns possessed by the Fae in military in they all the black unicorn riders are female as those dark unicorns will only allow evil human females or evil drow females to be their partners now as far as the powers of a unicorn go most people know the basics their horns can heal the wounded and cure the sick the Monster Manual also lets us know that if they are particularly close to a nature god that they can also get access to powerful clerical spells now of course in the D&D world the true power of a unicorn is the stuff of stories that's because well know what nobody really knows the full extent of their power there are many stories if not just a horn healing people but of unicorns straight-up reviving people from the dead there are also many uses for the horn of the unicorn in all kinds of magical rituals but the horns are so rare and the magics so complicated that no one really has been able to study this as an example a wizard King about a thousand years ago in Pharaon realized that it could use the blood of a dozen unicorns to make enchantments permanent and it created one of the strongest spell books in the world in the process but yeah as far as the potential of unicorns as ritual components nobody truly knows what we actually do know is the power of the horn of the unicorn while the unicorn is alive see the truth of it is that the unicorn actually has the ability to produce any clear expel of any level once a day with its born the power of the ability created by the horn is so strong that it will actually produce itself immediately regardless of traditional casting times the caveat is that the unicorn may only use this incredibly powerful ability when another creature is quote in extremists and quote in extremis is a Latin phrase meaning in the farthest reaches or at the point of death essentially the unicorn may only use this completely overpowered broken ability only to save another entity and only as a last resort now in terms of what the horn of a unicorn can do us an item that being if you happen to have the literal horn of a unicorn in your hand the only things we do actually know is that it'll work as a cure for toxins and poisons even for certain diseases we also know that the powder of the horn can be used by alchemists to create up to twelve strong magical healing potions and that a typical unicorn horn can sell for up to two thousand gold pieces in the black market now lastly as far as powers are concerned is the incredible teleport that unicorns possess see this is the reason why in stories and fables you feel like you saw the unicorn for like a microsecond and then it was just gone right or why an adventurer might see the beautiful backside of one entering a grove of trees only for the adventurer to quickly run behind it and to have the unicorn just be gone unicorns are supposed to never be seen and generally speaking when people do they only get a small glimpse before the creature is no longer there see the unicorns teleport ability is special in that it is extraordinarily fast faster than any other type of teleport it obviously doesn't require any somatic or verbal components but it also happens as soon as the unicorn wishes it to be in fact many times it actually happens more as a natural reaction rather than as an actual thought-out decision of the unicorn it is very explicitly described that if an evil person were to attempt to for example shoot an arrow at a unicorn the unicorn could teleport before the arrow even reaches it completely evading the attack essentially the normal - six seconds that it normally takes a fast caster to Casting teleport spell a unicorn can do in less than one I would like to personally thank my patron
