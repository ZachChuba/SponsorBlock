for as long as I can remember now PvP has been a hot topic amongst the OS RS community it's always been something I've had an interest in and it's an entire side of the game I've never explored before and it all honesty the end the reason I haven't explored it is because I suck at the game and I'm too afraid to even try it so I've decided to bite the bullet to make a fool of myself for your entertainment and learn to PvP this serious will see me leveling a new account and as I'm ready to progress into new tears of pvping I'll move up and a level to those requirements but also whilst leveling the account I'll be working on improving and learning new skills such as tech manipulation and using mouse accuracy sites to improve my clicks I'll also be researching and covering a variety of different aspects of PvP in even analyzing some of the top players out there to see what they're doing right and what i'm doing wrong i really do want to learn how to pvp and i hope i learn a great deal from all of this but one day i'd love to compete in the Deadman mode tournament seriously or if there is ever another one and all-stars PvP challenge I'm excited to share all of this with you guys in this new series I hope in some way it can serve as a guide and encourage at least one person out there to PvP I know it's exceptionally daunting to get into so like I said I'm gonna shame myself for you I know this isn't the first from scratch series to ever be done and Rob has recently started a new series similar to this after being hacked which I'm awfully sorry to hear about but speaking of being hacked - checkout and thanks to - name for sponsoring today's video so to kick this all off we obviously need an account to start training up now whilst I was going to create a new account I actually attempted this exact same series almost a year ago - the date before - ramen only before I even had 10 subscribers and it's safe to say that video didn't meet anywhere near my expectations and I deleted a couple of days after uploading it from YouTube this time around though it's gonna be different I've got a plan and I'm gonna make it work but after abandoning the series back then I was left with an account with some decent stats and I'm gonna pick it up exactly where we left off to start learning how to PvP I've decided it's best to start off the bottom and work my way to the top so I'm going to work my way through a variety of different peers of PvP we're going to start with free-to-play and then eventually move up through different tiers on members worlds with different levels but we're going to try and keep a similar range defense pure build on the account once I eventually get the hang of it all I could turn the account into a zurka or I'd love to try and make one or I could even give high breading and try breeding a solid go free-to-play seems to be the best place to start off there's actually quite a few elements to it that make it work in my favor the first one is that the stats required a relatively low we've already achieved them on this account the second one is that the money I risk in the gear that I take is minimal there's a much lower reward value for a lot of the fights as well meaning a lot of the bigger fish and bigger PKS won't actually be hovering around and finally most of the accounts around this level consist of a very similar build meaning that I know what I'm fighting each time and making it a perfect place to start but Before we jump into it all this series is about progression it's almost an experiment of sorts I need a baseline to compare myself to in the future for that I think a quick game of LMS is an order and will do perfectly and when I say quick I mean quick I'm gonna get slapped down immediately LMS in my opinion is going to be a fantastic place to measure everything I'm planning to learn although tribe reading is a hard place to start LMS has no risk and it's pretty easy to get into a just smash out a few games and kind of get the hang of everything it's also great for covering all of the skills that I'm planning to loan and I'm sure there's plenty I'm missing but at the very least I need to improve my mouse movements my clicks and gear switches I need to memorize where the prayers and spells are in both of their books I need to learn how to want expect weapons and learn to manage my distance from my opponent I don't even know how to eat properly or what the best food combinations are so it's all stuff they're gonna have to learn I'm pretty well starting from the bottom and like I've said I'm gonna make a complete fool of myself and I apologize for some of the awful performance as you're all going to see but everybody has to start somewhere and I want to show you guys that it is possible to get into it as daunting as it may seem never played this before so I am it's gonna be a bit of a rough time all around haven't set up any of the gear yet and so we're just gonna have to go for it just set off my f keys so hopefully I can get the hang of all that but I have no idea where any of the spells are located or anything like that [Music] a stuffed batch Jim that's lovely holy moly yep I just could smoke for the 40 because I turned off the melee prayer okay safe to say that was a disgraceful display I didn't even pot till halfway through the fight and if I had an eye tracker I would have been looking at my inventory the entire time I don't think I landed a switch or a prayer correctly but as I said we're starting at the bottom and this is a baseline it's just to show you guys I'm terrible at PvP and I'm gonna get better and one day will come in we're gonna win an LMS fight I promise you that we're gonna get there we're gonna do it anyways we're gonna move on to free-to-play PK now I think we're gonna be a lot better at that we're not gonna have to worry about switches or anything so we're gonna head on over to the wildy gear up and go for gold okay here we are over at edgeville for free-to-play peeking on both 308 these are the stats we're looking at for the account then not too bad we can use rune but I've decided to opt in for an a/d skinny instead of a room to a Sharansky me just because I'm gonna be dying that often I'm not even gonna bother carrying that much food so we're gonna get looking for a fight and see how we go we have enough switches and no prayers or anything like that to worry about so I think we're gonna be doing a bit better here that we did at LMS okay got ourselves a fight with a level 38 here he's got pretty decent strength but he's just that's all he's got well I don't even know what I'm doing here I could go and we're done should have eaten there hear it so I'm not taking too much food look I'm not fussed if I die it's not a whole lot of cash or really anything I could have probably swapped to skinny better and one taked in there when I had the chance but okay here we go got a fight with this to deliver 38 major we could probably hit pretty high cuz he's got next to no armor well I might experience not on that would really help that's what we're after [Music] shouldn't risk that I should have eaten it was only a small XP drop it's gonna be a lot of these coming in we'll go for another couple of fights have a got one with compactness though this guy's look at the one I wanted to fight originally let's see if we can bring him on board iPod up - okay let's do it this hits a terrible at the moment okay we're picking it up now oh okay that that was pretty good hey that was pretty damn good or well okay but good but back in it we're back in it we're back keep going oh I didn't swap back [Music] I got him we did it not deserved in the slightest before he did it give me that terrible loot okay I'll take that I'll take that you know what that wasn't too bad oh come on no I would have had that I would have had that are you kidding oh god okay well look I think that just about does it we got a single kill it wasn't deserved but we almost had to the potential is there you know we've got a chance and we can do it we have so much to learn so much to do but it's all a start and this is a good baseline because in a couple of months time we can look back at this and we can see the leaps and bounds that we're going to cover as we start to learn how to do this properly I'm also gonna go jump over and I'm gonna do a mass accuracy test and I'll start taking screenshots of how I improve over time and same thing this episode is purely a baseline and just to let you guys know what series is about but this is what we're starting for now a next episode I'll probably analyze that LMS fine I'm gonna try and break down some of the stuff from this free-to-play PK and I'm gonna get a lot more into it and I'll show you guys exactly where I'm starting and how I'm going to start improving so this is how I scored on the mouse accuracy site it's honestly a lot better than I expected it to be and we're gonna try and repeat this at least once a day and we should be able to start seeing minor progression from day to day and over the course of the next few months we should see major major improvements but this is only one small part of what I'll be doing to learn how the PK and eventually become a master at it so guys I really hope you enjoyed the new video and you can enjoy this new series it's actually the smaller part of another series that I'm gonna be calling getting good which will also involving learning to PVM slash boss I'm currently working on one of those videos now and I really hope you'll enjoy that too but for now that's the end of this episode sorry if it wasn't super exciting I just wanted to cover the basis of this series and get a baseline for where I stand at the moment and where this accounts gonna be heading I have high hopes for the future of this series and each episode may not be the same or similar to this every new episode might investigate a new technique or something new that we need to learn such as 1te deconstructing the core concepts of it so we can learn to master it and eventually incorporate it into our skill set so guys thank you so much for watching please drop a like if you enjoyed it leave a comment to let me know I really do hope that you guys enjoyed this so I'll see you all next time [Music]
