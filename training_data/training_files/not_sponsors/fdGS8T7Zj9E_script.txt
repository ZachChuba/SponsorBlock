hey Ron you with Tesla Tom and thanks so much for joining me on my youtube channel where I talk about all things Tesla's electric vehicles and renewable energy if this is your first time to the and it also helps my channel to grow today we're going to talk about the new software update twenty twenty point twenty four point six point four in our Tesla Model 3 including real-time side repeater cameras while you're driving and also parking all that and much more okay so like I said it's a big update and there are five aspects of this update which I'd like to touch on today the first one of course is the backup camera improvements which is the big one I'm looking forward to while we go for this drive the second one is dashcam viewer improvements and that's the ability to quickly go to an event signified by a red dot on your dash cam viewer for sensory mode and dash cam the third one is improvements to the tune in app it is more user friendly including the fact that you can now listen to podcasts up to two times speed the fourth one which I'm very excited about too is the walkaway door-lock improvements it means that you can set home as an exclusion which means that if you park your car and garage the car will not lock itself because it knows it's home and the last thing I didn't cover last update is the ability to use your scroll wheel on your steering wheel to play pause and skip through content in theater mode so I'll come back to backup camera when we go for a drive a bit later on ok so now in sentry mode you can quickly go to an event as opposed to having to scrub through the century mode clip which isn't very good anyway when you're scrubbing through so now you can see there's a red dot on the cent remote viewer and all I need to do now is to drag the cursor or the marker right there it's not the most sensitive view unfortunately but I can drag it right there and I can watch all four cameras and you can see someone there on the Left cameras right click that straightaway and you'll see that this gentleman here next to me is getting into his car so benign but it does shop as a as an event so I quickly scrub to it as the best having to watch the whole that's quite handy I think so the next thing I want to talk about is the tune in interface with podcasts on tuning you can now listen to things at double speed so let's listen to fountain Lane for our most recent episode there's Tesla Australia talking at two-speed and you quickly just just trouble between you know 2 speed 1 speed 1.25 1.5 okay so the next thing I want to talk about is the walkaway door lock option so go-to locks and the settings and now you can click exclude home which means that if you park at home in a garage the car won't lock itself when you walk away which is quite handy if you need to access something quickly in your car so the next thing I want to show you is that using the scroll wheel on the steering wheel using Tesla theater you can now start and stop using that wheel and also increase by ten second increments or go back by ten 30-second increments as well and that's from the last self or update alright so the last thing I want to show you before we go for a drive is the camera system which is being greatly improved since the last update so now you can look at the rear camera the left camera and also the right repeater camera now these cameras are located very close to the side mirrors so you've essentially got real-time side vision as you're driving and parking which is pretty cool and I'll show you that a bit later on as well and you can toggle between just the rear camera or both cameras you want to get rid of it just scroll it down like that alright guys well that is a rundown off the software update features for twenty twenty point twenty four point six point four I think it's time to go for a drive let's go and guys of course before we go for a drive let's make sure all our autopilot settings are on including navigate on autopilot traffic light and stop sign control and also full self driving visualization and I've currently got it on my old lane change setting as well as confirmation for lane change okay so the first thing I want to show you is how nice it is to park with these cameras now so and as you can see nice clear vision with both repeater cameras there and see that as I pull up right next to the curb you can see how close you can get to the curb now because you can see on that repeater camera in real time how close you are which is really nice very nice indeed okay so we're on the we're in the freeway on the north side of the harbour approaching the Sydney Harbour Bridge coming southbound but the repeater cameras there as you can see just going to see whether I use my side mirrors less because I've got these cameras now in view I want to see whether I can use autopilot at the same time activating it now I guess one disadvantage of having the cameras there is that I can't see the route right there on the model S&X you probably could see the route so you've got two screens but with the model three you've only got the one so yeah passing table boots now and once I get past it I will re-engage autopilot back on scroll it back up to 70 interesting yeah so it still wants to react to all the traffic lights so yeah bit of a handful at the moment I guess I've got a few things going on with the car we've got the cameras there okay well let's do available for now that's fine I think there's too much going on for the car and for me as well but we'll concentrate on the repeater cameras for now and I guess it wants to react to the traffic lights there next to me but a nice view there of the Harbour Bridge the repeater cameras and the back camera and of course what I can see headed me as well Kristen troll still on so we'll use up for the time being can I activate autopilot after I get off the bridge now still can't do auto steer for now yeah it still wants to react to the traffic lights on top of the bridge there yeah there is a lot going on with repeater cameras there gotta say so I probably wouldn't recommend using autopilot if the camera is on cruise control still okay it's still going to clear the traffic lights though to slow down a bit years around this curve and now on the carl expressway we should get a nice view of the Opera House here on our left I guess this is only my first time using the repeater cameras but I'm certainly not not looking at the side mirrors I'm still sort of really like relying on old habits at the time being even though the cameras are showing me quite a nice view like I said with with the cameras right there it's sort of blocking my view of the route wondered whether you could split the screen a little bit so you can still access the navigation but here we are on the the city proper itself so what I'll do is I'll just turn around here so just closing that for now I might cancel that - whoo yeah that was a certainly hot lot going on there and by the way to access the cameras just press that one and you can slide down can't stop like that - I'll slide up - turn it on it's nice nice graphics there left camera right camera sliding up does nothing for now let's turn right here we'll do a u-turn at the turning Bay down below at the Opera House then make our way back up north down yeah I reckon is going to take a lot to to get me to look at the cameras rather than my side mirrors for safety I just think it's a little bit too far away from my line of sight for me to rely on the cameras or at least the video rather than the side mirrors here it's just I've just got to turn my hand and eyes way too much down there as you can see rather than just a quick glance to my right and left who knows I mean if I Drive this more often I might start to rely on on the on the cameras having said that though the fact that Tesla's showing you that the cameras can be looked at was this guy doing it's gonna overtake him very slowly there's the Opera House there ahead of us it means that you know it's just another preview to I guess more autonomous driving more waving Robo taxi it's just showing you that you know it can be done the future is coming that the cameras are seeing a lot as well and i guess for parking as you saw it's quite useful at low speed you can see how close you are to the kerb and that's something that joy my wife was missing in her old internal combustion engine vehicle she had those cameras there guiding her parking that's what she was the one thing she told me she missed with the role mazda cx5 but I'm very glad that now these cameras are available for her and anyone else relying on cameras to park and look I guess sometimes you know if it's a really tight spot it's nice to have that vision as well it doesn't hurt to have a bit more security as your parking alright guys well thanks so much for watching this video this is software update twenty twenty point twenty four point six point four well these are getting a bit of a mouthful hunt they lots of numbers for each update this is the main update I was looking forward to the side cameras or side repeaters for parking real time and the driving real time and if you to hear from you leave a comment below okay guys thanks for watching stay safe and until next time happy chat
