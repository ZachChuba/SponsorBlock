this video was sponsored by Ray Khan and the desire to make it a reality [Music] honey you're embarrassing me in front of my friends okay okay okay we're gonna need some mold-making supplies for this project so let's go to the mold-making supply store materials for making things hey I make things let's go inside whoa that's cool let's check it out oh man that guy is hot that guy is even hotter he's a little horny I like him because he's squishy okay what I'm doing here is I'm going to be getting something called silicone rubber because I want to cast my hand again but this time I don't want to do it with alginate cuz I want to use a different kind of resin so whoa hey buddy hey how's it going looking a little slimy and disgusting there I'd go see a doctor that's what I'm doing here let's see if we can find some silicone rubber that's skin safe it's William Osmond what I was just trying to say is did you get you cute mom look I have no bones Hey look at that I just happened to have exactly what I need okay let's go back home okay before we cast my arm and hand I need to remove my arm here because I don't want a bunch of like weird texture on the arm so I'm going to have my daughter's hayslett and Avery I almost forgot your name to wax my arm err I'm not okay let the waxing commence it's not too hot is it is it yes oh my gosh oh my gosh is this so like safe you're such a man baby there's no blood yes there is Patrick okay what we're also going to need in order to cast my arm is a Christmas ornament container okay now that we have everything prepared and ready to go what we need to do now is pour the dang mold I'm nervous way this works is you put Part A Part B equal amounts by weight or volume it says so we're just gonna hope it doesn't suck so first thing I want to do is I want to give this hand completely covered [Music] you make me laugh no I need to concentrate well I'm having a blast actually been wet for like 10 minutes yeah we have to get Bobby a stool so his butt crack didn't show any actually my crack disease inside come to we might comes old friends I look like a superhero with like a cannon okay let's see if we get my hand out she's gonna kind of break that seal Healey Kiwi oh boy I don't feel really gonna give here Bobby fought a courageous fight it went on for hours he tried everything to free his hand he even at one point tried injecting air to where his fingers were but to no avail but then all of a sudden like the sword in the stone his arm was released from its silicone prison and it was at this moment that Bobby realized he had a right hand okay oh one second now that that's done what we need to do is we need to create a cube I decided to do it a little bit different way that I normally did instead of using weed I decided to use this stuff it's an epoxy clay two-part who makes Part A with Part B and you squish it together until it's homogeneous then you can sculpt it and turn it into whatever you want my plan is I'm going to take one of these silicone cube molds that I bought off of the Amazons I'm will be using it to fill with resin later but I also wanted to take advantage of the exterior as well so what I'm gonna do is smooth together equal amounts of Part A and Part B until it is homogeneous then flatten it out and wrap it around the silicone cube I tried my best to actually get it as cube shaped as I could on the outside let that set up for 24 hours remove the silicon cube from the interior now I'm gonna take it over to the bandsaw and cut off those edges so they're nice and flat and while we're at it let's go ahead and solder up five blue LEDs to a nine volt battery pack you'll find out what that's for later hi there there's just a few more things we need to get done to the mold before we pour the resin what I did was I took some of those silicon cubes and I filled them with resin and let that cure then using a laser blade I stabbed through the mold to cut out some squares that I could then shove those cubes into the holes what that's doing is it's creating a negative space so when I pour the resin and remove the cubes it'll leave cube shaped holes in there okay the moment of truth has arrived we're going to mix up and pour the resin into the mold I still don't even know if this is going to work first thing I need to do is put on some gloves okay what we have going on here I know we have a bunch of stuff is we have some mixing container syringe with super long needle I got these on Amazon some glow-in-the-dark powder alumalite resins they were super nice to send me some of their resin this is the clear slow and the reason I'm going with this is because it's great for casting objects instead of just a topical application perfectly clear it's amazing stuff I highly recommend it I'll put a link to their stuff in the description this is a pressure pot kind of like the hyperbaric chamber what I did was I bought a Paint Pot converted it to a pressure chamber thanks to the help of the tutorial of Jake Thompson it puts the resin under pressure so that the air bubbles get compressed to essentially being gone if you were to pour this without being at a pressure pot it would have tons of little bubbles and it was still a cool but I just want to try it now in the pressure pot so won't have any bubbles okay don't judge me okay let's stop all this talking and actually get to mixing [Music] all right and now we wait and hope it doesn't suck okay it has been approximately four hours so it should be nice and setup and ready for us to do this all right sorry about that watch this is really weird it's empty no more airs coming out I'll plug this hole first two seconds now listen I'll plug it again how is it doing that leave a comment in the description if you know what's going on and why it's doing that okay let's open it up please lay it all stayed in the Martin guys I'm Martin real hard oh I just art it again I'm hilarious [Music] okay after the hand has been removed from the silicon and the cubes have been removed from the hand we're gonna make up a batch of resin cubes and I'm gonna do it exactly like I did the hand the only difference is I'm gonna add some pearlescent powder once those are done and we get them popped out of the molds I realized that not all of the sides were perfectly flat and since I'm going to be gluing these together I had to Sam to each and every side which was a huge pain in the butt and eventually giving them a Polish until they had better original lustrous shine all right now that the cubes are done we need to do a little bit of work on this bad boy see all these little bits sticking out those need to be removed so we're gonna go out to the shed but first we gotta go out to the shed to change the oil in my chair pretty soon okay oh hold on a second okay now we've got this guy like this and you can see all of this crud jutting out is called flash it's the stuff that sploosh is out around the cubes that I put in there so what we're gonna do is we're gonna grind that stuff off using my rotary cava I think I'm gonna use some of these guys right here that's the brand name maybe some of these probably gonna use some diamond bales okay enough shanaynay gains let's get on with it okay what we need to do now is drill some holes into the cube everywhere the fingertips touch it and I'll tell you why because I want to have these doohickeys shining up wherever the finger is touching and then we're gonna attach the hand on here touch the cubes onto here using some superglue so let's do that guys we've got the black cube finished we've got the base finished we have the LEDs soldered and ready to go the hand is done and the cubes are done so all that's left to do is to globe Alti goodness but first let me tell you about that being said let's get back to the video [Music] [Music] hey guys you already know what I'm going to say [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you guys once again for making it to the end of the video and remember with a little bit of resin some imagination you can make this too and I did it all without carving or sculpting in the traditional sense remember if you liked this video please go ahead and smash it also if you want to see more cool stuff like this in the future go ahead and give me a subscribe as well also if you want to see more pictures of this piece and other projects I'm working on give me a follow on Instagram I'm also on Twitter I do my best to be funny there it doesn't always work out but at least it's a way for me to keep in touch with you guys thank you once again I love all of you and as always all is Marty and the desire to make it a reality I'm just messing with you you just do it ever you wanted to okay bye MD what are you doing oh goodness it looks as though I've altered again Oh short [Laughter]
