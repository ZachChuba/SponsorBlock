hey what is going on you guys it is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today I bring you all a pretty uneventful monster this is loot from 1000 brutal blue dragons released into the game June 9th 2016 these are considered to be a stronger version of the normal blue dragon just about 271 combat found in the catacombs of Kerr End the max hit of the brutal blues with Dragon Fire is about a 50 and with melee and magic it is a 21 so it's pretty strong monster pretty strong dragon you know I wasn't too worried about the dragon fire though since I was just safe spotting these this whole video with range and if you're gonna do that you just need to be sipping an anti fire potion and using protect from magic and you'll be taking zero damage and as long as you don't step too close to the blue dragons there's only two in this area as you can see I won't melee you or jump on you or anything like that so this video was done on the alternate account the gear for this video obviously was max range with the dragon hunter crossbow finally using the money that this accounts made from loot videos for better things to use for better loot videos so it was nice to upgrade the gear a little bit and this was pretty much done right after the court video was completed I just got around to editing this finally and the next video you're gonna see by this account should be talent wyverns still have a couple hundred to kill but really just been focusing on really AF cannibal monsters that don't take too long to make into a video just been trying to stick with some afk things in general which is why brutal blues was a perfect choice to do as of late because these things are just so laid-back mean I will say it's a lot of banking you know usually I was banking like every six kills or so the hides and the bones and all the other items do stack up it's pretty much how we tracked the kills for this video was just the bones and the hides and since at peak hours being almost maxed on this account and especially with the gear and the bolts I was getting about fifty to sixty kills per hour so it's really just three days of AF King on the side very comparable to brutal reds and blacks the drop tables not as impressive as the brutal Reds or the brutal blacks but it's very similar in to how quickly you can kill the dragon the supplies the gear the inventory oh that's pretty much the same I will say though out of all the dragons I think the most underrated brutal dragon of them all is definitely the green one which isn't in the catacombs of Corinne to my knowledge we will eventually get to killing that one but for now I'm just kind of going down the line to each dragon individually hoping maybe we can see some luck with a one-in-ten Kate drop or something fancy like that and that was of course the goal for this video you know see how much we could pull off just in general from the normal loot profit-wise and of course maybe hit a Jacana Vistage cuz you can actually get that from brutal blue dragons which I didn't know about that but that's kind of what motivated me as well to do this video as it goes for the drops you know I was picking mostly everything up regardless of the value I would bring hi out though and that would take care of the adamant hasta yeah diamond spear as well as the plate legs and every other item I just picked up and stacked up in the loot tab as you can see right there and it's pretty much just what grew from start to finish as usual in these loot videos a unique draw that's actually common from these brutal blues would definitely be the blue d hide body this is actually the only monster in the game that drops this blue di body and it's used for a lot of level 3 clue scroll steps so for any iron men out there who don't have the crafting level to make one I would say this is your best alternative that was actually able to pick up 94 range on this account wall doing this video only got 5 more levels left until 99 I think I have a pretty big either ogre or jogger or Moger a video planned for this account and I think I'm gonna be safe spotting any of those monsters that I just named with range so I probably will get 99 range on this account eventually but I just again it's just an alt so I'm not really prioritizing the levels as much as I do on the main or the Ironman that's so much on the main but you guys know what I'm saying and yeah other than the blue D ID and the a D related drops you can also expect a rune items such as the rune long swords and the plate bodies and those are both 1 and 128 surprisingly these brutal blues also drop dragon long swords daggers and even the med helm which are all the same drop rate of the rune one in 120 gay you can obviously hi out those two but you know since this is a loop video I just wanted to build up that tab I've also heard of people bringing lunar spells here and tanning the blue tea hides as they get them and bone crushing the bones so I guess they can just stay here for a lot longer than I could do a lot more kills in inventory but obviously since I was just AF gaining this I wasn't really prioritizing efficiency with this video but since we are on the topic of efficiency I did it go with the archer ring imbued rather than a ring it wealth this time you can't expect coin drops but it's not enough to be worth a ring switch so I wouldn't worry too much about that and here we have our rarest drop of the video so far anyway not the hard glue that's only one in a hundred and twenty eight but that rune battle axe that you see there in the same kill as the clue scroll according to the wiki that is one and 3641 it's just on one drop table so that should be accurate but yeah it was really surprised to see that certainly not a Vista a lot of hard Clues during this video only managed to get one ally and according to the wiki the drop rate of that elite is one in 750 so it's pretty on point for the elite clue the hard clues as well I mean I'd say we're pretty much at the drop rate currently 600 kills in two six hard clues so the ratio is pretty much right there as you can see you don't need a gym bag or a herb sack with brutal blues you know they don't really drop too many herbs or too many gems and if you recall what I said before that rune battle axe being the rarest drop well we just managed to top that with a rune spear there's two different drops though for the rune spear on the wiki or at least two different percentages one of them is one in 9800 and the other one is one in a thousand so I really don't know where they come up with these drops but since I wasn't wearing a ring of wealth I'll just stick with the one in 9000 yeah that was the new rarest item so and it's always those really weird strange uncommon items that just have such a high rate to get them as a drop but nevertheless it is a drop so it counts and even though these brutal blues are found in the catacombs of kur and I didn't really get too many totem pieces I mean I did get my second totem piece over 600 kills in so we were almost complete with our first and as he goes for the ancient shards those were pretty average as well I mean it's about a 1 in 170 chance to get them so you know a lot of shards over time through rolling catacomb videos but certainly not a lot just per one video the drop rates are always super high on those pieces yeah we were able to complete our first totem and get a clue scroll at the same time so I would say that's definitely a win and if you're curious what bolts I was using I was just going with the amethyst broad bolts I think I'm pronouncing that correctly at least maybe I am that's pretty much the most cost effective bolts for brutal blues alongside brutal Reds and brutal blacks you don't want to be using anything too expensive because supplies do come into play here as soon as we get to the price check you'll see what I mean definitely spent a lot on supplies and as it goes for the inventory I kept it pretty basic I would really just bring a couple prayer potions alongside a super ANSI fire sip as well as a range so really don't need food for brutal Blue Dragons but you know don't be ashamed if you want to bring some I mean you know you might actually afk a little too much and one might spawn near you and you might start taking damage but there is certain areas that you can stand in these catacombs where you can really just stay there and even bring deadly grab with you if you want you can virtually never move if you don't want to so it's really up to you I have heard of people using melee here as well since they're not as strong as brutal blacks or brutal Reds are I heard that dragon hunter alliance with PI D works pretty well here so it's really up to you what you want to do but dragon hunter crossbow is no doubt about it one of the best in slot weapons to use against every dragon in runescape that's kind of why I went with that setup you know that original full armadyl setup I think it's a beautiful look and it worked out pretty well this is a pretty easy video pretty laid back monster don't count out those brutal blues just yet no they're not as good as the Reds or the black surely but they're still pretty good just by themselves so with all that being said let's go ahead and get into the price check as you can see in the bank they're 1,000 lovely dragon bones and since these are brutal blues we can expect 2,000 blue dragon hides so very nice to see other items you can expect just about 400 K from Alex as well as 185 blue dragon scales so got 37 mithril full helms so shout out to all of those let's go ahead and see what our very first price check is gonna come out to be just about eleven point seven mill it down not too bad just about six hundred K in in Seoul heads as well thirteen dragon meds a lot of alcohols thirty-one room longs twelve rune plate bodies and four rune full Helms source we can't forget about the infamous rune battle axe in spear and the second price check this is really just nothing I mean the gems the throwing axes and of course the spear and basically just 50k from that so if you were to round up both of those numbers then the normal loot comes out to be just about eleven point eight mil from one thousand brutal blue dragons now it's time to get into the clue Scrolls as you can see the elite bringing in nothing as usual let's shout out to the elites anyway cuz we're always gonna do them and now it's time for all the hard clues which is pretty much the main highlight of this video as it goes for just you know assisting with the price check making sure that we make a little bit more money and yeah I mean overall it wasn't too impressive as it goes for the rewards you know no Third Age this time around didn't even receive a master clue unfortunately but all in all from all of the clue scrolls we did get an extra 1 point 7 mil so now all we're gonna do is subtract the supplies from the overall amount that we made from 1,000 brutal blue dragons and we will see just how much profit we are walking away with so eleven point eight mil in normal drops and 1.7 million clue Scrolls if we go ahead and we add those two numbers together then we do come up with thirteen point five mil overall and then of course we subtract three point six mil in supplies and that means that we are walking away with just about nine point nine mil profit from 1,000 brutal blue dragons yeah I know it's not the most exciting loot video of all time but at least you know a little bit more about brutal blues now and if you ever curious of killing them you should have a pretty good idea of what you can expect to make so with all that being said thank you guys very much for watching the video I should see you guys in probably three days from now with loot from 3000 ents finally that video is taking me almost a month to do and other than that I should be back to streaming today I feel completely fine and now it's just time to grind again so yeah it's cheers to that and I'll see you guys next video and until then mister no sleep ow
