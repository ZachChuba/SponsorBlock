I'm probably not the only one who's noticed at this point that a soos ROG makes so many different gaming PC components that you could pretty much build an entire system with nothing but ROG stuff so when a soos reached out to sponsor a video for Intel's gamer days which is gonna have giveaways deals on components desktops and laptops starting August 30th we figured why don't we try to finally do it so in front of me is all the components of what Anthony and I hope is going to be the ultimate test rog gaming system that we had ever built and of course pretty much everything in front of us has that one important feature that everyone everyone needs [Music] so as always our build starts with safety first rolling out the gamers Nexus mod mat so we can get started on our machine so at the court oh is of course gonna be our ROG Maximus 11 code motherboard so this is the one that we've been using on our Intel test bench basically ever since Intel launched the 9900 K I guess yeah ever since said 390 it's honestly been a solid board I haven't had any complaints at all and this has been through plenty of both CPU and GPU testing not this one in particular this one this one's new but this model of motherboard that's that's the main point right all right let's pull out all this it's okay it's just plastic so to install on our board we've gone with the core I 999 hundred K so do you want to walk us through why we chose this particular model because it gives us that extra bit of flexibility with Intel Quick Sync so say you're a content creator it actually integrates pretty well but the Adobe suite right now that is a point in Intel's favor as far as CPUs go also it is still a little bit faster for gaming it's not you know the major leap that it used to be but that plus a relatively mature platform I think this is a pretty solid platform to build from so next up we've got our memory and we're actually doing a pretty craptastic job of using our G components here aren't we because this is for only one four three so far they don't actually make our OD memory yet but this memory is or a sync compatible which is very important since it is our GB memory so this is G skills Trident z RGB 3200 C 14 kit it's actually Intel XMP ready and these are 16 gig dims which is going to give us a total of 64 gigs of RGB goodness in our finished system delicious overkill that is so far over the top that it's not even funny I think we even have a video planned in the next little bit sort of demonstrating that this much memory is completely unnecessary for gaming wow we're making excellent progress here so do you want to get the case fired up while I try to figure out this cooler I've never actually this is the part where we can paralyze things a little bit this has been kind of a single-threaded task up until now yeah humor it's funny cuz hyper-threading and actually there is something I need to do while you're working on that I get these nvme drives installed so once again not actually an ROG component so we got a couple of 970 Pro one terabyte drives we're gonna be running these in raid zero for that maximum performance so this is interesting with just one screw you can actually install both of these SSDs oh yeah that's a neat feature in fact it appears as though you don't actually need it at all you can just chuck this thing on top of it and it'll just hold it into place I don't really want to do that though so I'm gonna see if I can find that mounting screw in the box oh wow I actually have not seen a Seuss's ROG chassis before yes it has what they call super comfortable handles and they're actually not bad yeah I was gonna say they're they they're okay I wouldn't call them super comfortable I think the handle is on the other end okay that's something you might justify calling super made a fabric instead of sharp metal I was wondering what that was let's see they got these little buttons here actually I play vastly prefer the latch system for these kinds of things cuz I'm always super terrified of tempered glass shattering when screwing and like a screw into it yeah everything in here actually feels pretty good so this is a soos is HIGHlarious cooler that not only has our GB built in but it also has a display because that is what everyone needs it's funny it's not even the only component in here that has a display oh that's right doesn't their power so if I have an OLED display on the side yeah and I think the motherboard might also okay check this thing out so you've got your copper base at the bottom and then you've got your standard ASA Tech mounting ring system you've got your pomp up here but then asus has gone and built like a multi-level parking structure on top of it so you've got a cooling fan down here and then you've got this PCB up here that there you go handles both the RGB lighting and the built-in display like most cases usually have their drive bays in behind the motherboard tray here and yet in this case you have all the drive trays arranged in such a way that you can have all the cables running parallel with the rest of the cables in the system so it's a lot cleaner back here okay this is the rog Ora terminal it's an RGB hub but what has got me stammering right now is that it comes with a wall plug what please tell me it can be powered internally okay so the wall plug is for external case lighting and the 4-pin yeah well no no it's actually got a four pin Mike molex to DC adapter perfect so so while Anthony is working its way through the RGB stuff I'm trying to figure out how to hold all three of these fans in place while light position the radiator under them and get my hand out yeah so I can mount the rad up in the top now I could ask Anthony for help but he's really busy working on important things well I'm just you know doing cooling stuff you don't need cooling if you have our GP not if you've got aesthetic who do I sound like looks and form factors all that matters don't need cooling Steve Jobs no he cared did he steve wozniak care at times okay I guess he did why he did make sure this computers at least worked were those the fans that came with it yeah it comes with industrial PVC fence I didn't know that yeah it's freaking awesome so a soos is the one company that's just like you know what Knox what makes the best fans why are we why are we not just using them in our a I oh I was getting ready to put like sticky pads on this but it's actually exactly the right size for a drive bay oh it's two-and-a-half-inch yeah oh that's cool it actually has to dress the holes too oh that's cool those of you who have watched any of our build guides before probably noticed that I ran all of these power leads for the fans towards the back of the case so that when we connect them they're all at the back where we won't notice them now we've got the world's longest USB to cable this is coming off the CPU cooler that gives me a lot of options for routing oh that's that's potentially a problem how many USB two headers we have - oh good that is not a problem then oh it's sort of a problem oh okay well figure that out later though okay this was one oversight there's no convenient spot to route the front panel audio and front USB here I also have to go in from over here yeah that was my favorite spot and you can take that route out so now that I've got my cable under the shroud I can go ahead and bring this up and plug into my front panel USB - connector there these have to be the thickest wires that I have ever seen on an AIO CPU cooler how the F much current are they planning to draw through this thing you bastard get on there I don't think I have ever seen a USB plug that has that block on it like all the all the housings have that cut out for the block but I've never seen anyone actually use it yeah come to think of it so where do we want these RGB strips ah everywhere oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah for sure for sure there but okay so here's the USB problem we've got our front USB 3.1 which is here we've got our front USB 3.0 which is here and we have two front USB 2.0 which are here the problem is that this place in a Seuss's attempt to go as fully featured as possible has four USB 3.0 s and that 3.1 powered type C there so they include an adapter so you can use a 2.0 plug off the motherboard for these 3.0 ports but we don't have any left because of all of our RGB stuff now for extra credit what we could do is we could take these two connectors and combine them to fit onto a single header do that is it worth the extra credit we got to go all the way oh so these are really simple to work with all you got to do is pop up this little plastic tab here at the back of the pin and then loop pull the pin out I wish the ATX connector was this easy to work with so now what we do is check this out so in the pin block here from the RGB controller so we're taking the ones from the cooler and putting them in there you can see there's empty ones because no one bothers to actually some do but very few people bother to put just the four wires in like a single width block so all we got to do is just put them in in the same order neat huh so now those two devices only take up a single USB 2 header ow ah damn that hurt what would you hate it when you drive a pin under your fingernails Oh mm-hmm yep oh crap what everything I just did was totally unnecessary there's a right-angle USB 3.0 port here so there was enough for the front panel stuff and for those both to be there well now we have one more I'm bleeding I held it stabbed me right under there yeah I don't know where the RGB headers are supposed to be okay so here is your RGB synchronization header nice then check this out we've got a couple of SATA power so there's a lot of power for this case that's kind of hilarious and then for the two USB 3.0 they've got one that's right angle and one that's straight to account for that a Seuss's motherboards often have one straight in one right angle sick oh wow that's amazing the system works Oh so between the air cooler this friggin thing our RGB controller and whatever this last thing is we have a total of three SATA connectors and one molex connector before we have actually plugged in any drives or peripherals why do they need to make it molex I don't know so this is kind of cool actually they've got this like cable management haider thingamajig in here and it can actually slide depending on how wide your motherboard is so that allows us to hide things like this USB 3.1 cable behind this cool little shroud here so here's our USB 3.0 connector here which on a normal system is one of the kind of eyesores because it's so bulky but you can't even see the cabling at all you just see the connector going in at the back so this one too this goes nice and snug at the bottom just like that wow that actually really is really clean yeah I like it power supply for Anthony so we're throwing in our 4 or 1200 watt platinum which appears to be the entire reason that there's a window built into the bottom of the case because this power supply has a display on it now I don't always keep the most glamorous parts of the build for myself but when I do it's dual 28 ET is an SLI this is gonna be the ultimate minecraft computer like that moment when you feel like your graphics card needs to have an RGB controller and a fan controller on it so this case does have that feature that allows you to put one of your graphics cards and kind of this like show-off position over here but I will not be taking advantage of it because with hard SLI bridges being what they are it's not possible to set up SLI with one of the graphics cards in the show-off position and one of them installed behind it you're gonna pop this out yes future I mean maybe someone made like a thing oh you've got to be kidding me did you find that in the manual how did you know that I just saw it and I was like HM that looks like a vertical bracket I wonder where that goes that's actually pretty smart I come bearing an assortment of PCI Express riser cables and a one and A two and E yeah yeah what yeah all right so I'm putting in my second graphics card here now I have a bit of a problem this extension is not the right angle kind so it's gonna be hard to get it down low enough and it might not work anymore once we do that so we're hoping for the best there we go nice okay now I wouldn't ship the system like this no but I also wouldn't ship a system with heavy GPUs like this installed in it anyway so all right cool speaking of which these both have 2a pins yep good okay all right so power me up Scotty it is a power yeah so sorry right or left unless your left oh okay that's yeah to be clear this probably would have been easier if we had taken the shroud off but we always like a challenge around here sure let's go with that kind of feel like I'm artificially inseminating a horse oh wait I can see it I can see it through the window that's easy we're done boom okay nice Wow I can't get my arm out Oh are we there we're almost there wow these are not that easy to plug in wish I had done them beforehand like I always advise people to do in my build guides and then forget about every time I'm actually building a computer mm-hmm sweet that is so clean hey that's not bad actually yeah that's not the best I've ever done but it's decent it's all in one place I need you to plug this in what is that that's the RGB control for the power supply all right horse doctor time I don't see it at all okay let's let's just let's look at the manual let's calm down no shroud taking the shroud office for the week Oh Oh hold on no I don't think I was over far enough oh okay whoa all right we're getting close laying out our peripherals there we go all right can I scoot past you here scooch away oh we need a monitor we do dang it hey soos has thoughtfully provided one for us though this is my second-favorite monitor from a soos right now it's are 144 Hertz 4k g-sync display I'm more of an ultra-wide guy though so I actually like the 200 Hertz ultra wide ah my finger can you tilt the screen down towards the bottom of the base thank you oh I love pivot monitors got that RGB life now that is cool being able to see a real-time readout of how much power your supplies drawing yep I was expecting more rainbow birth okay wish me luck everybody all right it's prompting us for if we want to enhance the system performance with the XMP settings oh yeah sure on multi-core enhancement turn everything on this is an ROG machine what the hey let's good luck everybody and it's running at 60fps no it goes really nicely with this build my stealth water bottle LTTE store calm subtle stealthy okay I'm on a pair of gpu-z yeah see what gpu-z has to say about this okay so one card is at 8x that's what we expect yeah the other card also 8x nice okay yeah anything's fine we can close up the panels and now what we got to do is get our sink running is there a peel on here there is a peel I leave two peels two peels it must be somebody's birthday dang it I suck boo boo me boo hiss even worse I sucked Wow okay so this is it the all ROG PC is done let's go ahead and do just a quick Cinebench r15 run see how things are going how's our overclock doing well we didn't really overclock it well no just the XMP all core turbo blah blah blah yeah a strip and we can see our wattage 265 ish and we're sitting at around four point seven gigahertz just shy of that yeah that's respectable not bad Cinebench score of just just shy of 2,000 that's actually pretty good isn't it yeah 1996 decent year that's good yeah all right this is one of my favorite things to do on an HDR enabled wonder shadow the Tomb Raider in HDR looks so good can you do HDR and 120 Hertz at the same time I believe so yes looks like it's completely locked at 120 at 4k I know right there's not a lot of systems that can do shadow of the Tomb Raider at 4k Ultra details except I turned motion blur off and just not even begin to break us way what's the power splitting 712 watts alright I was worried we weren't gonna be able to do the quake to RTX demo but it turns out it's a 25 second download so we're back in business ladies and gentlemen that's what a gigabit connection will do for you yeah hi hi baby it is amazing how even with these low-res textures and stuff better lighting changes how the game looks in such a big way you know what's kind of funny about this is like turning our TX on in a game like this is kind of like built-in nostalgia glasses the lag time between like shooting and especially the fact that there's a projectile is really disorienting in today's world it was disorienting back then - so we're at 4k HDR with our T axon and we're running it like 60 FPS yeah with the LS s on - so if we had d LS that's off it would actually be even worse that's freaking crazy how many of these guys do you have to take out all of them I guess that's like assumably the objective of war so there you have it guys everything is running flawlessly this is it you may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like but you probably like it cuz this thing looks freakin sick I think Isis has done an excellent job of tying together certain components in particular like the motherboard and the case especially and making them go together in a way that I don't know if I've actually seen before like especially those USB headers really cool stuff what else is really will also have linked in the video description so thanks for watching guys subscribe and all that good stuff see you next time you're just playing games now aren't you
