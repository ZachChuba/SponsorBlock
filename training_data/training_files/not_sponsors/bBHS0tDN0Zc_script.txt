on last week's episode of then we fight 577k and this is actually our total cash stack cannon ready if i do say so myself i'm having a real difficult moment right now guys i think i'm gonna go melee dragon scimitar gran i really kick myself out let's buy that cannon oh my gosh i can't believe i'm going to do this once i do it i can't go back so you know i'm going to do it before i think too much on it it's sold to a bit demotivated that i lost some time there because i went and did like you know those attack quests that i really didn't need to do i just gotta hope kins is [ __ ] up as well who will come out on top this week watch now to find out whole truth about raid shadow legends link in the description welcome back visa g's another eight hours getting into crunch time now this is the uh the last 16 hours eight hours on this episode um i really need to start focusing on getting my range up now because 33 is not good enough uh we're two levels away from getting ourselves another gp reward so i'm just going to be doing that with the emeralds that we finished off doing in the last episode as soon as we get 700 total level i'm going to go ahead and do monkey madness and then i think that is going to be the last quest i do on the account doing monkey madness because of the defense xp and the hp xp it will give us it'll be really really helpful for that and then it will be as i say just a case of getting these two up as high as possible a 164 so we can use the dragon hunter or the dragon crossbow even um so that we can use dragon bolts because they are going to be way better than using runei bolts um that is the plan are we gonna do it i don't know and if i do go for 64 am i going to be able to get myself to a decent defense level realistically would want 50. if i get 64 range and 50 defense then i might push for 50 strength um to wear granite because granite is very very good against range and i'm almost certain kins is going to be going range and if he does go melee granite is still a decent decent option so that is the plan for the episode let's start the clock and boom we are into episode three let's get ourselves this 700 total level there we go 32 crafting coming in and that is the 700 total level so let's jump on a link and give us our gp reward this is a massive gpu reward nearly 1.3 mil see i know the canon idea might be a little bit silly but i just feel like if i can push these total levels a bit i'm starting to get such huge rewards that it really doesn't matter that we're spending a lot of money on the canon right it is time to start monkey madness you guys have seen this quest thousands of times across everyone doing it on pretty much every account they ever have so i will not bore you with all the details but we are going to start it and i bought everything i need and we are following good old slam music my [ __ ] man boom there we go we just killed the demon let's get out of here do i have any way out of here uh let's go to edgeville and let's go get our xp oh yes completed and we are gonna go get our xp now from dario upstairs hopefully someone enjoys themselves to a night 10k and dario mate i need to make sure i choose the right thing here i want the defense xp 39 defense at the moment let's see what we go up to also hp have a look at that that should go pretty high up and of course the strength attack will get some as well boom oh naughty 37 hp coming in 49 attack 46 defense very very nice taking us to seven to six total level right we need to start range training now because we've only got 33. hey guys welcome welcome to episode three of course we are in the same exact spot we finished episode two in we are pretty close to that 700 monetary reward and uh we got a cannon and 802 cannonballs so we're just gonna fire the rest of these cannonballs and hope they actually get us to that 700 total level if they don't we can maybe get like a mining level real quick like we are really really really close to that next reward which of course is more cannonballs but i think after the 700 i am going to do the dragon slayer quest simply because defense strength i don't really need the strength i guess i do because i need to train defense but ultimately it's a lot more levels and a lot of defense levels which are very needed so should probably attack these guys as well 700 total level after getting 33 hp and 54 range let's pick that up pause the timer and bring our cash on over we got a big one we got a big one coming up nearly 1.3 million coins are now added to the account i i just seen cannonballs now that's a lot of freaking cannonballs just bought all the required items for dragon slayer and we have nearly 1.6 mil on the account so believe we actually start in varrock screw it we're gonna be really quick i know i'm in varrock but we're gonna tell you when we can probably should bank on my armor while doing this shouldn't i this is still one of the saddest parts in any quest sorry cabin boy sorry i couldn't save you i was actually nervous that i didn't have enough food on me i didn't eat once okay so i don't quite think this is going to get me to 40 defense but i do think it's going to get me close to 40 defense hopefully it's much uh 39 i thought it was 38 for a second that's the wrong skill but that's a lot of levels in general um let's see 16 total levels we got of course we have access to the room plate body now and the green dehyde body but thankfully we don't really need those i mean i do want 40 defense before i continue range training and here we go guys this is the big purchase 756k are we gonna get it for that we are not that's a bit painful uh we're gonna have to pay slightly over price for it boom yeah beautiful probably could have bought it cheaper if i bought it individually but oh well we've done it now um and we are going to buy some cannonballs as well cannonball how much is he going to cost 130 let's get 2k to start with and we'll see where that gets us boom okay 1.5 mil still left and we're not too far off getting another skill level of 750 or total levels so that could work fairly well so i was thinking about doing like sand crabs or ammonites but i was thinking they're so crowded these days that it's just not gonna be worth it i'm gonna get crashed so often whereas look at this because it's dead content now no one uses it you know so we're gonna use this let's set up the cannon with the base there we go um and i also thought about chinning in the monkey manor's tunnels but i looked into it and it was gonna cost me like two mil an hour and i really don't know what that xp is gonna be like um you know with having like 45 range with grey chins so i just decided that i would play it safe if i'm sort of sat here with like loads of money and i think i can afford it then maybe maybe i will go ahead and do some chilling in the monkey boundless tunnels but as of right now i don't think it's going to be worth it so uh yeah let's see how well this does and let's start getting some range xp okay that is 40 range so i'm going to go back to varrock get myself green d hide and then we're going to try out the dagonauts i didn't go there straight away because i thought i might be a little bit too level uh low level to uh to be too effective so we're going to give it a go see how it is we're going to need prayer pots we're going to need food but it is going to be significantly better xp uh just looking at my xp right now i was getting 37k an hour over at rock crab so i think it should be at least 45 50k now with the eu short bow and of course uh green d hide on and there's way more around and you don't have to you know run around and get them all aggro they're already just sat there waiting so let's go and give it a go see how this goes gonna go for 50 and then we'll go back and we'll do all that good stuff again let's see how this goes guys looks like we've got a free world straight away yep we do nice right so protect from melee and put the cannon down here i've reset my xp rate so we can see how well uh that's gonna do keep making the thing please nice we're at 79k xp an hour right now it hasn't quite settled you know so it could be a bit lower than that but that is insane i thought we're gonna get like 55 imagine when we've got like blue d hyde on and maybe a room crossbow red dehydes stuff like that we should be getting like 80 90 95k possibly we're currently at 80k right now this is insane and it turns out i need to bring more prayer pots probably another ranging part and way less food i thought they were going to hit me way more than they are here's here's the part when where i'm very confused on the best way to get my defense up do i train attack to get a rune simi or do i just say screw it with an adi simi you know what i'll do i'll get 40 defense with an addi simi and see what kind of xp rates i'm getting and if it's really really that shitty then we're gonna have to do the 40 attack method this is really bad xp no no it was seriously so bad i was getting like 18k experience an hour and um just no no i figure i can quest up attack and get some combat not combat levels total levels and it just gets us closer to 750 and faster training defense with a rune simi once we're at 40 so right so after they do their little dance um yep put the orbs on the tree should get a lot of attack levels from this don't know how many exactly i mean we're gonna do the fight arena next which i think should get us really close um i could do the grand tree as well but honestly i don't need to see the problem with doing the grand tree is that it takes longer so i'd rather just do the fight arena get really close to 40 attack and then just use the addie simi to top it off rather than do a 25 minute quest because i don't need extra attack experience and i don't think it's worth the time getting a few extra total levels so i didn't have to kill the general but uh get in that cheeky magic level boom i wish i had that when i when i faced off worm brain in the jail at port serum dude yoinked my uh my 10k because i didn't have 33 magic so i didn't record myself completing the quest that i forgot my bar actilies in the bank i got everything else um but we did get a 40 attack we did get two thieving levels as well and of course that one magic level what i'll probably do is get 40 strength and 40 defense at sand crabs no rock crabs we're definitely going to rock crabs because this is a much quicker walk and yeah 7 30 total level we're really getting up there guys we're really getting up there this gives us faster xp for training defense just buying some supplies thinking super sets without the defense of course so not a full superset but thinking gets definitely worth it if i want the maximum xp and just to show you guys really quick they are incredibly cheap especially the super attack i'm also just buying room boots and a combat bracelet this of course we could wear right now and room boots with that 40 defense so uh yep without further ado guys let's go train and get some levels this looks like it's gonna pay off fees and g's it really does i'm so happy we went for the cannon it's just whether or not i can maintain the cost now it's incredible we're gonna get 70 range so easily as long as i can keep up with how much it's gonna cost me then then i'm good to go then i'm good to go we're possibly gonna get 750 through probably range and hp levels so that's that's that's a good thing there and for uh for 750 you get two mil so there's two mil coming our way fairly passively still got about 800 900k in the bank so i think we can probably get ourselves to that milestone if not my mining is still pretty low my runecrafting is low we could probably get like 50 levels there between them maybe get a few you know easy you know there's a few here that have like 300 xp uh pretty close to being done so i think we could probably scrape together 800 total level without wasting too much time which would then give me like 4.5 mil on top of the cash i already have um so i think we should be able to keep up with it but this is incredible 93k xp an hour right now at this level with this gear is is genuinely broken and that is 50 range coming in so i'm going to pick up the canon and we're getting out of here we are starting to run a little bit low on cash got about 250k um but we're not far at all away from 750 total level which will give us uh how much 1.9 nearly two mil so we'd then be reimbursed two mil i think i have enough supplies right now to get myself 55 range or maybe like 54 range and an hp level here and there so i think with what i have i'll be able to get that just passively through doing the uh the you know range stuff so i'm going to rely on that just off to go and get the next accumulator this is the setup i'm going with from now seeing as we are a slightly higher uh range level we can now use this so the canon should get us even better xp per hour now which would be absolutely awesome i've done a bit of rough calculations and i think i can get 70 range it's going to cost a lot of money i'll have to go up to i think 850 total level but if i get range levels range range range range and then while i'm doing that i grab myself quests and keep getting these total levels up just uh every time i run out of money i think if we get to 850 total level i'll have enough money to buy all the things i need for 70 range and a dragon hunter dragon crossbow i keep saying hunter crossbow but a dragon crossbow and hopefully a fury as well so i'm gonna have to get 850 total level for this plan to come off but we've still got like 13 and a half hours right now so we've got time we've got time so just got 40 strength we are now on to defense just want to get 40 and then we're out of here the reason is just for the uh the blue d hide body and of course the red d head body when it comes to it and hopefully the black d hide body i don't know if we could actually hit that but that would be really really cool man we get clues like crazy i would say from our first canon grind and now i've had about seven clue scrolls not even exaggerating but um yeah 40 defense then we're probably gonna top off 750 total i might start to fish get some herbal levels hunter's a pretty easy one there are definitely some pretty solid ways to do that let's get our money reward and then of course with our extra gear and whatnot we can uh just start sending some more cannoning and getting that range level through the roof because guys we haven't grinded range yet that first little thing we did was like nothing compared to what you guys are about to witness with the range training 40 defense all right there we go let's go straight to varrock and i'm probably going to start with fishing let's do some fishing there is 30 fishing technically i do think i could prot notes go this way i can probably get 31 faster than i went from 29 to 30 because i can actually catch salmon now but um it is a skill we can go back to if we need to i think i'm gonna buy some iron bars and make some iron plate bodies could i even oh yeah easily no i can't no it's 33 [ __ ] well i could just miss something else until 33. i might just buy like 500 iron bars they're pretty cheap they are 129 each so it's gonna be a quick quick few levels and then on to herblore and then that should get us to 750 needed 64k not bad at all so coming up on the last few bars here after this play body we still have three left okay let's make a battle axe we're at 36 smithing we're going to stop there three more levels we'll get it through herblor it should be really quick we'll just make some attack potions because i know there's some of the cheapest you can do so see you at 750 total level guys so unfortunately the guam potions unfinished weren't selling for like 30 over the price and they're already like 105 each guams are like 30 each so i just decided to suck it up and a wrong one i decided to suck it up and just you know buy 300 guams and 300 water and just put them in it's going to slow us down but only a few minutes about to come up on 27 which is the 750 total level so i'm gonna finish off this inventory then pause the clock and bring over my nearly 2 mil 2 mil and getting 90 to 100k xp range an hour means i'm only gonna have to spend like five six hours ranging and we've already done a little bit of that we're 100k xp already so uh yeah i think we can do it things have to fall in place though anyway let's get the upgraded uh accumulator uh devices and boom i didn't bring any coins i'm so angry with myself [ __ ] now buying my bloody third glory [ __ ] sake man and uh you can't use like the i know a few people were like use the recharge scrolls you can't you need to finished hero's quest to be able to do that so unfortunately can't use that but uh oh well there we go we have the device beautiful back to varrock and then back to cannoning okay this is [ __ ] crazy 133 k xp an hour at the moment this set up just oh my god i'm gonna die my god this setup is incredible i didn't realize it was gonna change it that much dropping a little bit at the moment i don't know if that's because i was eating or not but look at that it's gonna be over 120k at least i think it's gonna settle like 125. this is insane i cannot believe how quick this is so we've actually cracked 751 so i need to put the gp reward on the account but i'm going to wait until i'm done because it takes a lot of time to get back to the ge or you know take the account here and i just want to keep the cannon going and i want to get this xp so i'll pause the clock when i'm done with this inventory and it's probably going to be the last one because i'm running out of supplies and i probably need to do some quests or something to uh to get it back but uh we are averaging 120k xp an hour which is just insane absolutely insane uh currently at 55 range and nearly 41 hp so things are going very very well five hours left of this time so uh yeah very happy and we keep seeing snapdragon seeds and tour store seeds on the floor and it's definitely painful and there's a lot of lag as well we'll keep lagging we got 30 we're actually really close to 31 i'm actually a bit angry about that but we don't need to top off on that right now that's fine we have 3.4 mil we're just shy of it the first thing i want to buy is a dragon crossbow the reason is is because i want to secure the fact that i actually have one and i don't accidentally buy something that allows me to not be able to afford a dragon crossbow i mean i can't wield it we need 64 range i'm well aware of that but i wanted to make sure i had it because this will certainly be the final weapon we have in the fight also we got to stack up on lots of cannonballs um we are going to be doing a lot of training i think i'm gonna buy like 7k of them i think i still have a few hundred in the bank please sell wonderful cannonballs are so cheap okay now we're gonna top off on some range gear i'm gonna buy a better shield buy the red d hide all right guys brief explanation as to what i bought i'll actually talk to you guys as i teleport there firstly topped up on mithril bolts definitely think it's the best bolt to use for cost efficiency i think i pretty much maxed what i can when it comes to blue d hide got the shield got the red d hide for 60 range the shield as well got the room crossbow for 61 range dragon crossbow for 64 range and of course topped off on cannonballs which i think i actually did record 7.2k cannonballs ranging pots no i definitely want ranging pots yeah no it's gonna be worth it it's gonna be worth it it's gonna be worth it i promise you guys anyways we're gonna go back after we buy these they're actually really cheap let's take a look ranging potions are 400 gp each we're gonna buy like 20 of them seriously no joke and then i'll see you guys when we start getting some range levels and stuff so with some hardcore grinding we finally hit that 60 range wow wow wow wow now i would love to buy a dark bow i think that gives better range attack than this adi cross however i can wear the room crossbow in one level we went from what was it 144 to oh my gosh you can't click today 154. we went plus 10 range bonus and it's gonna go up way more in one more level's time and guys we saw three hours and 17 minutes in this episode and i'm already 60 range i'm already 60 range right that is probably going to conclude this trip and probably everything until we do a few more quests because i've only got i think 200 ish k 250 maybe 300k in the bank um i need to pick this up before i die because we really do not want to die oh no thank you brilliant uh yeah 500 cannibals left it's not going to be enough to get us another level or anything we've got to put the money on the account so i'm going to get link over here and for 750 total level let's pause the timer and bring a huge amount of gp onto this account 1.946 it is nearly two mil just shy of it which is insane let's look at a link it means that we can now just go straight back to the ge buy a load more suppliers get a load more levels um and then i'm probably to be honest gonna burn through all of this two mil uh to see how high we can get on the range level and the hp level and then we shouldn't be too far away from uh 800 total level where i'll try and get mining up i'll probably go for some room crafting um just so that we can actually force those ones uh forward so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna just keep going on with the range use this two mill right i bought 13 000 cannonballs on top of the 500 i had let's put this away and let's grab another summer pie uh it's put me down to just just over 300 kgp so he's literally went and spent like 1.7 mil there to get a few more prayer pots uh i didn't buy any more summer pies but we got a few left so we should be okay on that front but yeah we did just go and spend everything pretty much so we need these total levels this is 60 range coming in if we're gonna lag again it's so laggy so laggy today there we go 60 range so we're gonna pick up the cannon and we are gonna get ourselves back to the ge and we're going to upgrade all our gear and we'll hopefully what we're going to we should do get even more xp per hour we're getting about 120k there let's see how much this is going to go up to i'm also going to buy a room crossbow because in one level time we'll be able to use it still 3.6 k cannon balls left and of course we get another huge cash stack reward at a 800 total level which we might need to tap into maybe not i don't know i'm definitely gonna see how this plays out hopefully this can last the rest of the episode but i don't actually think it will so i need to figure out how i'm gonna wrap up the episode but uh we're definitely gonna stay here until all these cannonballs are gone and hopefully we can get 64 range with it i'm not sure if that's possible though alright i'm not gonna fight with this guy because if i do i'll just waste xp but this guy just came up dropped a cannon and his name is nice guy jason but i'm gonna hop so i'm doing a lot of thinking about my hit points level i would say that's equally as important as getting my defense up as well now of course you know i'm still doing a lot of range training so that still will go up from even canadians of course i'm using the crossbow um in in 5k xp time i can use the roon crossbow so hopefully we get more hp experience per hour like that and of course the dragon at 64. so i still do think there's a lot of levels in hp to be had even while cannoning however i'm really thinking about it and i'm actually quite nervous now i really don't think he's going magic still but if he does ivins hits 25s you know um i don't think he'll have the god spell so i'm going to say 25 is probably the highest magic hit he could hit if he goes tank range he could definitely hit 25s plus um and if he goes melee i'm assuming he could also hit a 25s if he has a dragon scimitar i would say melee might actually be the smallest hitting weapon because you need 60 attack along with a decent strength level but you might have a dragon dagger what if he could hit 25-25 i think that's a bit of a stretch but you see where i'm getting at here so i'm thinking i might have to do some dart training just to really really really push that hp level through the roof um i still will finish off this episode largely just using the canon and any spare time i might focus on just getting 800 total levels so i can upgrade my gear i mean of course we need more money to train with we need more money to buy our gear at the end i want a fury as well and that's actually pretty cheap it's like 1.6 mil or something like that and of course the next reward is nearly 3 million coins so we're currently sat at 61 range and we're lagging again what is going on um and yes so i can now equip the roon crossbow and oh my god 134 ish 133k ish an hour we're getting at the moment ludicrous ludicrous xp um i think what we're going to do is we've easily got enough cannonballs what i hope we do for 64 range that will unlock the dragon crossbow so the plan is to get 64 range and then we'll start questing again get some levels up i think dig site's gonna be a good one to get just torstol seeds snapdragons everywhere um i've made like 1.45 mil in loot from uh from the dagonauts since uh starting but anyway yeah so the plan is going to be to do some questing and get ourselves some levels get ourselves to 800 total level and then we'll be able to buy the dragon crossbow and that way that'll be secured for the fight and obviously we'll also then be able to uh get some slightly better xp rates which is incredible we might be able to go and touch like close to 150k an hour okay i'm now at 64 range could have kept going but i want to get myself enough money together to be able to afford the dragon crossbow now because that will put our range bonus even higher and obviously the cannon runs off your range attack bonus so i want to have as high bonus as possible while we're going um and cannoning so we're gonna have to make enough money we need 800 total level to be able to afford the dragon crossbow we'll actually have easily enough money to buy the dragon crossbow um if we can get 800 total level it's like we could nearly afford a fury and the dragon crossbow if we get 800 total levels so time to do some questing okay so i want to do fairy tale part one because i think it will give me an instant like 19 farming but it means i've got to do a few pre-req quests and the first one of that is nature spirit so we're going to go ahead and buy everything we need for this and get it done okay i think this is gonna be quest completed it'll make this all look very nice boom there we go three thousand crafting two thousand hit points two thousand defense xp very very nice 33 crafting coming in that's what we like to see getting closer to the defense level i do want 50 if we can do it uh how close we 1900 away okay very nice on to the next quest right here we go lost city completed and we can start the fairy tale quest now so 43 hit points just got it and we're out of cannonballs in seven more what i'm gonna do is teleport right to lumbridge using the home teleport spell because we're gonna get up defense we're just gonna go right to 50 before we do anything else because i was going to actually do hunter but then i realized it's better to get the levels that i know i really need to get and then top off with hunter to get past the 800 mark for more cannonballs and better gear so we're going right to sand crabs we have everything we need in the bank are ready to start training we have our pots we have our weapons we have our gear i'm also probably going to bring the mithril darts because i'm really really curious on the xp per hour so what i'm going to do is actually get 64 range because we're really close i know 4k is a very small sample size but i'm sure i'll get a very decent idea on what the xp per hour is with 63 range and darts mithril darts that is at sand crabs so right to sand crabs we're going to gear up in draenor and then head right there and see if we could um get somewhat close to 50 defense we were paying the 10k i just spent like a minute hopping and then realize it's probably not worth it because it's gonna happen a lot i'm gonna get crashed i'm gonna go reset my spot people are gonna try to yoink it so i'm gonna go to this craft spot up here i know i'm not leaving till i get um 50 defense and look it it is empty it is empty um sweet yeah i think the three spot will be fine right so we reset our range experience per hour so let's see how much we get we'll pot up um i'm not gonna use prayer i don't feel like flicking range that would be really really annoying although i will try my best to flick combat or i should say not combat melee when it comes to it because darts are just way too fast and i'll be missing half my flicks anyway just got 64 ranged guys so here's the thing here's the thing and that few minute test i was potted i bought it twice in that few minutes so i was like as max i could possibly be without prayer flicking at 63 range it was looking like 45k an hour and it did just stay at that for the few minutes i was doing it it didn't really fluctuate at all 45k is not that great considering cannoning is 65k xp at the ogres now granted i know that involves making a lot more money so essentially doing skills to make money so that time has to be factored in as well i understand that but 44 increase it still seems like more xp per hour even factoring in all the grinding i did and keep in mind we aren't done candid yet we're just here for um some defense experience because we want that 50. okay this should be the end of fairy tale part one boom there we go what levels are we getting here let's have a look 17 farming okay i thought i was gonna get 19 but still 17 will take 36 magic coming in as well so that is a nice few levels taking us to seven eight two now i'm actually going to go ahead and start fairytale part two just so i can actually use the draymond stuff because there's actually a um fairy ring right by the lighthouse where we're doing all our cannon training so i'll be able to just ferry ring in and out back and forth between the ge and the lighthouse to make it super easy to make trips even quicker so it's going to be worth it it's going to take like i don't know slow music video says 11 minutes so 11 extra minutes two we're lagging again brilliant 11 extra minutes so that we can save more time over the next 10 hours so yeah i think it's gonna be worth it okay i think we are now done so let's try it i think alp is the lighthouse there we go we have access to fairy rings so we can get it super quickly now that is so useful okay we need to get ourselves 800 total level so we're going to be doing the dig site because it gives a really really decent uh what's it called mining xp reward and uh obviously our mining being level 10 i don't really want to be power mining iron um oh we can't even do that yet we'd have to you know get 15 first then power mine iron and i don't think it's going to be better than just doing the dig site quest so dig site quest should get us really close it might even get us to 800. i'm not 100 sure we will see um but let's give it a go okay this should be the end of the quest didn't take too long about 20 minutes i think boom 15 000 mining 2000 her blood oh it didn't even clock that we got her blood 32 mining 34 her blood oh my god stop that clock stop that clock wow propelling us into 807. wow wow wow i did not i thought it was going to be like 20-ish and we got a herbal level that is insane right let's get link over here and top this gp fund up because 50 is a nice you know nice milestone plus i might bring granite to the fight it's got very high range defense and the the slash defensive bonuses are worse than rune but they're pretty much the same so if he goes melee i wouldn't stress too hard but if he went range and i didn't have granite on i'd be very upset with myself and i forgot to mention the biggest thing of all actually we have 64 range which means which means we can now hold a dragon crossbow and bring dragon bolts to the fight i'm not sure what the best bolts are i think they're dragon opal enchanted i will consult an actual pkr on this and get their advice but i'm pretty sure that's the best thing we could use in this case also i think this whole defense grind will take around 2 hours and 15 minutes ish i mean let's see how much xp i'm getting per hour right now 28k okay maybe like two and a half hours at most then i'm gonna haven't been flicking i think i will start to do that the moment i stop this little recording here see every time i record it slows me down just a little bit i can already see the hit's increasing here we are guys coming up on the final three seconds let me actually pause that with one second ago so you guys don't hear that horrible noise let me just de-aggro these guys real quick so i feel pretty good about where we are right now after episode three we're a total of 24 hours in we have eight hours to go so 24 of the 32 hours we got that 64 range 46 defense we're gonna begin episode four doing the exact same thing killing the sand crabs getting 50 defense then we're going to top off on the 800 total level or maybe get really close to it because i still have like 600 canon or 600k to spend on cannonballs which of course would get me some more range levels and hopefully some hp levels if i'm still attacking with the crossbow which you have a dragon crossbow now oh man but with that said guys i am going to go take a nap because in the past two days i spent 24 hours on this account and i still have eight hours to go and i really want to be able to think about this and make the right decisions but i have a pretty good solid plan for the last eight hours so i hope to see you guys in the next episode which will consist of the final eight hours the reveals and then the fight which will declare the winner that happens next episode guys and i hope to see you there but raag is now out of here and i'll see you the next time and it is going to be a whopping 2.919 k let me just make sure that is correct it is correct just shy of 3 mil gp with the with the current gp we have we do have 3.1 mil that is absolutely amazing of course it's gonna go into uh it's gonna go into getting 70 range but if we can get 850 total level the reward is 4.3 mil which would be enough to buy my whole setup for the fight um and i think that this 3.1 mil is easily enough to get a 70 range using cannonballs so let's log out a link we'll go back using our new draymond stuff we can get to the lighthouse super easily and we'll go back to cannoning so timer back on let's do this the first purchase is gonna be a dragon crossbow oh my god yes oh and we get it on the cheap as well oh it's all going well so we can now equip that that is gonna be our weapon for the final fight and we are good to go we've got ourselves the draymond stuff we'll go on over we also have a special attack with the dragon crossbow which will hit multiple dagging off at once so i mean it's gonna help the xp slightly it's not gonna you know break any records but it is gonna help us um a little bit but obviously we need to use this to get to the lighthouse and this is gonna be nice i haven't actually spent anything more on cannon balls just because i want to see how far uh this is gonna take us in terms of level and then we'll spend the rest of the money when we get to it but we're looking really really good and that is just so nice being able to tell to the ge and back that easily let's pick this up that is where we finish so we have ourselves about 200k xp off 70 range which is uh pretty pretty nice actually pretty happy to see that it means we're going to be able to do that in the next episode uh we've got easily enough money to buy the cannonballs we need and then it's just a case of getting ourselves 850 total level so that i can buy a fury for the final fight but uh we're looking really really good um if we have enough time i'm going to go for 50 defense and 50 strength and that will allow me to wear a granite helm and granite legs plus a granite shield and it gives massive range bonuses and i'm almost certain he's going to go range um what i might do is i might wear a black d-hide body and a black d-hide legs just in case he's going mage i don't think he will be but that could negate that and if he goes melee i think this setup beats it anyway so that's probably gonna be the way that we're gonna sort that out thank you so much for watching guys check out the next episode it will be coming up in the next few days and uh you know what i'm feeling pretty confident after this after this thing i really think unlocking the dagger knots was a massive massive thing to do and i really think getting the cannon was a good idea as well so uh let's see how it goes we will catch you in the next one [Music] you
