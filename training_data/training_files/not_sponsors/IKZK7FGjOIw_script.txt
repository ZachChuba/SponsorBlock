what you're doing Mercedes get out the way this is where the real cars play as our car falls apart and is comfortable yeah [Music] hey everybody hey back with a very fun car this time we still look Corvette we still a Corvette from the lawns yes and we're getting away with it JK this is a 2016 2016 Chevrolet Corvette zo6 over 0-6 depends supercharged zo6 or Sentosa yeah I have actually never been inside a Corvette neither by not once we were both valets yeah I've never driven a Corvette ever in my life this is the first time I've ever been behind the wheel of Corvettes alright let's start by slapping some specs down some specs down this car has 650 horsepower which is a lot the most horsepower of any vehicle we've ever driven yes and it has 650 pound feet of torque it's a lot to work in a 6.2 liter v8 engine the powers at all in the front that is so huge that it's just a massive big I love it and you have an 8-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters I'm curious to try the battle shifters because sometimes they're great when they're bad they're just you might as well not have yeah we're in the twisties already giving this a little a little bit of a preview of performance I'm like the little scare do around these two quick even those buffs right there it felt like you wanted to throw the back end yeah the back end really wants to fly out from this and that's that's partly because of how powerful the engine is but also partly because the tires on the back or not completely bald yeah there the guy who owns this thing has been eating it for sure yeah absolutely [Music] three two one [Music] Jesus Christ sixteen that was awesome yeah that the difference coming of this and the Tesla P 100 D this is so much more of a show yeah the Tesla's just like screw you we're at 60 right now and then but there's no sound this is just it yells at you and you feel it and you can hear the tires start to spin I love it oh man that was scary do you think that's scarier than the P 108 and well I don't know ah the P 100 II made my vision blurry part of me wants to say that this was scary because this feels more like an animal yeah this feels more just like raw and brutal even though it's a little slower the test that was paved the Tesla is behaving it's more refined yeah this is more just like just like screams when you unleash it it's like a lion I love this that was fun I feel like Corvettes accused to be hideous from 2000 to 2012 generally until they came out with the new c7 series yeah like these this generation of Corvettes which I think are definitely an improvement over the c6 generation and I think they were they've almost nailed it this is so close to looking perfect yeah I just there's something with the front that I don't like still I was gonna say I feel like they've perfected the back end the back end with the quad exhaust pipes in the back looks great it looks really aggressive that resilient 90 degree spoiler and I love it it's very angry looking and aggressive and I dig it yeah even the sides look like leading up to the front I think it's just the very front that I have issue with and I'm not sure what it is yeah I'm not sure maybe it's the grill that doesn't look quite as aggressive as the rest of the car I don't know it and part parts of the exterior most of it looks good but more parts of it do look cheap yeah and feel cheap and feel cheap yes like I put my foot down on the side I don't know what to call science Kurt's the side skirts and I just tapped it with my foot get a thing move that's the flimsiest thing I've ever seen on a car ever yeah it has some a lot of plasticky bits on the exterior that makes it feel cheap yeah and part of that is because like GM needed to cut corners I feel like with making this as cheap as it is yeah and this car is hella cheap it is for the performance you get this car brand-new today a 2019 model costs eighty thousand nine hundred dollars yet nothing can touch that in terms of like horsepower for your buck in terms of horsepower for your plug in the zero to 60 time of this which is rated by Chevy at two point ninety five seconds it's like lazy you get a sub three second zero to 60 time you have a sub 11 second quarter mile time this thing is so fast you get akka chip it is like a rocket the only thing that we've driven that is technically faster I thought no I see this now the only thing we do is technically faster is the P 100 D yes in ludicrous mode yes and that's faster to 60 than this is yeah I don't know about the quarter-mile though I don't leave there and this definitely has a better top speed this tops out at 205 miles per hour 205 so if you're running late to work you'll probably get there on time place the performance figures that you get for this for the price you have to cut corners somewhere oh yeah and though they did yeah and the way they did it is by having some cheap parts and moving on for the exterior to the interior you feel that especially sitting inside here this is not a premium feeling right it's not super comfy no like this I mean this cars a couple years old but this the cupholders are already busted like it doesn't close there lots of plastic you piss lots of rattling bits I feel like I could pull the handle off of the door here yeah it's just not not great it's yeah it's not very high quality but I'm okay with that because you get all the performance and you're getting this car not for luxury not for how comfy it is you're getting this for this almost love it the things I like about the interior I like the gauge cluster yeah I like the mix of it you have a digital display and the kind of a digital dash in the center followed by more analog dials and gauges on the left and right cool yeah I do like that you also get a heads-up display screen in front of you that shows you not only your revs and your speed it also shows you how many g-forces you're pulling nice at a specific moment so right now we just like cruising casually we're pulling 0.07 G's nothing zero G's that's cool though that's fun to keep trying but just got something like lots of little performance gimmicks yeah then I think are fun like the exterior is just bristling with vents and yeah and wings this has a performance data recorder also inside of it so you can record like a zero to sixty times on lap times it's cool I also like the badge that you get in the center that just brags about the horsepower yeah and pound-feet so if you get a friend in and they ask me like pays the score fast man look at my stand be like yeah dude it's like pulling through this f1 is a big cheesy [Music] you held back on your run I did I was scared that was amazing oh did you feel though that did you hear the tires yes yes so I take back everything I said that is superfast that is ridiculous oh yeah that is what it wants to do all the time it just wants you to unleash the beast so this car gets not that's terrible mpg as you might think yeah you get 16 miles per gallon in the city which is kind of horrible yeah but it's 25 mpg on the highway that's not that bad yeah so you get a combined 19 miles per gallon which for this as it is not bad yeah for a muscle car and you use premium gas of course so like Ana it would be expensed it's gonna be an expensive car to drive yeah I mean you know that going into it yes but it's also a Chevy so like you know like standard maintenance and parts and stuff aren't gonna be too plentiful and breaks you can fix it more cheaply than yeah it will be too heinous to fix it and keep up with it one thing about this is the visibility you got to rely on the reverse oh yeah I didn't we haven't talked about that yet the visibility is pretty trash and this is like the wing in the back takes up a half your field of view it takes up half the window what is nice though it's not only do you have a backup camera up since the so low to the ground you also have a camera in the front yeah this shows you how close you are to like scraping your nice expensive Corvette on a curb that is handy it's nice that they have that that's a cool feature assuming you're buying a new one of these 2019 2019 yeah that's what II 8900 M eighty thousand nine hundred dollars before options so 81 grand base that's one of the seven speed that's supercharged and with the 7-speed manual okay so you pay I think it's like another thousand dollars for the automatic yeah which honestly I think I love manuals but I would take this in an automatic so I think I would do because of how just powerful it is I put this in the manual and test our paddle shifters here all right [Music] takes a little while ship yeah bad bad that's discipline so yeah I would take this automatic yeah those take awhile to shift but I would still do this an automatic for sure when it's an automatic it handles the shifting pretty well like when you gunned it and when I gunned it it handles yeah it goes quick it does it out of pretty in a precise manner yeah it knows what it's doing yeah I mean this car is designed for you to stop the gas and let it do its thing it's mostly I feel like designed to go really fast in a straight line yeah cuz like I'm scared going around corners quickly in this yeah I would agree with that this is definitely more of a drag car than a track car I have seen people tracking their Corvettes but yeah me too they are they are like fun track cars but they are but from the factory it's a it's a drag car I feel like it is more of a drag car what else can you buy for $80,000 or less that could even come close what can you get for a hundred thousand they could even come close to this so the only things that come to my mind for our hundred thousand dollars or less is the Lotus Evora yeah the Lotus of over 400 which is 106 right like for like us big specked out version yeah you can get them for less than on you can get them for less than hundred you can get over around in the 90s brand new the the Shelby gt500 yeah the the dodge demon maybe the Porsche 911 yeah Lotus Evora but do any of them feel from the ones you driven they'll be grooving the apart I know what you're gonna say they feel like this none of them that I've ever driven feels like there's nothing I've ever driven in my life feels like this yeah this isn't probably the proper muscle car there's a difference between a sports car and muscle car yeah muscle cars are just big dumb brutes and they go really fast and then I kill you sports cars they're more refined science and refined and they'll get you going fast and you'll feel like you're going fast but they won't be screaming at ya one last discussion we need to have yeah is this the Corvette zo6 the supercar no why not I guess Chevrolet says it is if you go to the website and you look at the zo6 on Chevrolet's website they say this is a supercar it's not mid-engine not that all supercars have to be mid-engine but that's a big plus right it doesn't have any kind of fancy door I was gonna say the Ferrari 812 superfast yeah its front end test room that's definitely a super color so mid-engine is like that's not that's not a market rate it's not necessary it just doesn't feel like I think when I think super car I'm like okay it has to be more exotic or rarer than a Corvette yeah but this has the supercar numbers it doesn't absolutely 650 horsepower it could stomp some supercars yes 650 pound feet of torque and at the zero to 60 time this has supercar stats it does and number what do you think you think it's a supercar I don't know I've been thinking about it the reason why I feel like for me what holds this back from being considered a supercar is a how common it is yeah how mass-produced it is and B how cheap the interior feels very true because to me I feel like a supercar not only is very fast and very agile but it has a very clean nice interior to match and to like go along with that at least some more expensive interior even if it's super Spartan and utilitarian at least it's gonna be covered in real carbon-fiber and stuff we've got lightweight materials this is just cheap plastic yeah that's kind of my attitude on the zo6 Chevrolet we'll say this is a supercar and I'm sure that there are going to be people in the comments who say this is a supercar yeah I would say but I understand the criticism before why people would say it's not yeah I'd be perfectly willing to say this is a workingman's supercar that's a good definition because this is not your high class supercar this is like it's a blue-collar skate the phone caller supercar exactly that's actually a good definition I would stick with that yeah this is a blue-collar supercar there's the episode time yeah blue-collar supercar the Lotus is the car you want to get if you're more of a knife fighter and you're wanting to be more agile this is a warhammer yeah this is just something that you're just like usually rushed crushing things so if you're a more of a warhammer type of person this is the car for you if you're more of a knife kind of person the Lotus is Stefan I wonder how many people that's going to resonate with ya I am a Warhammer guy should buy the Corvette alright let's get into this alright so starting off as we always do a performance very solid I think it's very solid it's great obviously it's so fast so loud but but it doesn't handle super great we're taking it real slow around these girls fast as I want to take it right here yeah I'm not comfortable going faster than that snow without squirrely it is and the paddles aren't there bad that great seven and a half that's what I was thinking too yeah I think it's seven and a half is a great great score then on a practicality you know like it's not terrible it's a terrible you get 19 mpg combined city/highway you have like a decent amount of space unless you take the top off then that sacrifices a lot but like you don't do that you do have a decent amount of cargo space yeah cupholders you got side pockets I'll give it a four I'm gonna give it a three fun factor fun fun very fun fun fun fun I'm tempted to go with a 10 Wow honestly I'm gonna go find I'm not gonna go that high I'm gonna give it an eight and a half okay I love this thing and I it's rare that I absolutely love automatics but the paddle shifters in this are so bad that I would much rather have an automatic because the automatic is good it is this is a co-op it car this is just you hit it and you go I'm not even taking these turns that's because I'm afraid of it's gonna spin us yeah and then we'll crash but if you have a nice open flat stretch or between stoplights or if you just want to pass somebody this car will put a smile on your face that is a little blast I would give it an 8 on the fun factor it's definitely a riot yeah cool factor pretty pretty negated because it is just a Corvette yeah they're pretty common people say I hate saying that it's just a Corvette because it is this is an amazing car it's nice I love it yeah I would definitely buy one of these yeah that being said nobody really looks at I'm that much I'm gonna give it a 6 yeah whoa I'm gonna give it how many of us 6 I'm gonna go to five and a half because it is cool like if you're in a parking lot full of other boring cars this thing will stand out yeah and if you're at a gas station in somebody ribs that you will look at it yeah quality man exterior quality abysmal yeah the side skirts that's just unconscionable like I wouldn't even put those things on I'm tempted to honestly go with a four that's what I was thinking on quality it's it's not good yeah it's pretty low and then value which i think is hot still great yeah I think it's really high the trash bits about it awesome value I'm gonna give this I'm gonna give it an eight eight yeah I think I'm gonna have to go with an eight point five yeah this is I mean you buy this for one reason and it just does it so wrath of the value the value for money like the the money for performance value in this is almost unparalleled yeah okay so our average score for the Chevrolet Corvette zo6 at least the 2016 model year is a 37 out of 60 that's the average GTA score that's pretty good there's one of our highest support phones we've ever done mostly because of that yeah I think it's a great car I'm a little sad it's not higher but we have to know we don't yeah it suffered because of quality issues on the inside the interior it's not very comfortable it's suffered on cool factor as well but man I don't care the fun factor in the performance is what saved this car and made it a high-value and makes it a good purchase in my opinion I would recommend it I'm sure you would recommend it yep you got the money go ahead and splurge and buy one yeah that's all I can say totally agree I would if I were you blue collar super total color super car check it out if this is your first time watching thank you for watching stay tuned for the next episode I'm sure we'll have something else great we'll see you guys stay at peace you know sometimes when link below we promised
