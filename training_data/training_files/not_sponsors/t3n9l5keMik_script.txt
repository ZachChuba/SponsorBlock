you do this I'll call the police on you I don't care hey guys how you doing welcome back to another di who I and just the worst intro anyway today I'm not wearing pants and there's no way you can disprove that let's move on okay so BuzzFeed um yeah both of these BuzzFeed you know I often find myself ah you're doing your BuzzFeed quiz about what kind of ginger beer I am or something and think yeah I want some life advice from the guys who made this okay cool um well let's look at some of it but before that love them let's move on with the video if you're in a hotel room without a bottle opener your door can do the trick of course perfect and and the hotel cleaner will be so happy when he sees the broken glass or the look in his face will be awesome if you turn the hoodie backwards you've got the perfect receptacle ax√© I think that gets me is this original post is obviously a joke like no one was actually meant to go and physically do this but and then steep and over here from the BuzzFeed staff looked at this and thought yeah fair enough that's that's pretty cool oh god I'm just imagining like with the popcorn one like you flip it around afterwards go to put the hood on and well like you've got butter oil on your on your head yuck you're not good anyway moving on from that let's see what you guys have sent me ad DIY submit at gmail.com let's go right so you put like cumin food into this cat food thing and it doesn't really make it clear if it's the friend eating it or if it's you eating it in front of your friends um either way it's meant to be an epic prank for your friends right so we've got two options here it's either you're eating from this cat food thing in front of your friends who think that you're just eating cat food so the prank is just that they think you're eating cat food the prank is that you're making yourself look like a where it's not very good prank because you're the only one who looks like an idiot like it's a prank when no one knows that the pranks happening and everyone just thinks that you're freaking weird that's that's what's happening right it's either bad or you're pranking your friend who eats cat food as a snack by by replacing it with not cat food in it in which case I've got a whole bunch of other questions yeah I'm pretty confused let's see what the people make of this I hate this freaking gosh-darn piece of poop a cow with every fiber of my being fair enough and it counts this Patterson thing which which I keep seeing these guys say I'm freakin gosh-darned piece of its own line that frickin very good that should cover it [Music] [Music] ah-ha-ah-ha kai cool I'll just get you to hold hold that ball for one second yeah hi there's a maniac on the loose with the wrong pants issues for some reason we well yes I'm scared [Music] oh that looks unbelievably uncomfortable or I like it you're doing that purple mattress company that the third a bunch of uh nanami but a bunch of other people are sponsored by yeah well if they ever reach out to sponsor me nah okay I found a new type of much more innovative much less comfortable probably much worse for your back kind of bedding called cut board just to just a freaking cardboard box have you recently bought a new TV or a new fridge or an or something that comes in a large box well I have good news for you because you also bought a bed it turns out two for one [Music] okay now this is one of seven awesome experiments the experiment being does a blender blend things oh my wait I think I think performed its earthly function that was made for wow that's incredible like it's something next up on the list of experiments it's like if I put this like cold food into the microwave it comes out and it's like hot it's it's hot food now oh my god this is incredible I've made a discovery here and next up on the list of experience we've got like it if I put this cold food into the microwave it it comes out as hot hot food holy crap we've done it and did you guys know that if I'm in my car and I put my foot on the accelerator yeah it'll go in a forwards direction that's incredible and they've also got this other one where they just run over a bunch of toothpaste tubes and they're like whoa they braked that's awesome like imagine you're at school and your teacher says hackers instead of dissecting the frog to learn how it works we'll just be running over it and watching it go on the road that'll be epic [Music] oh yes this is so epic everyone knows the award-winning Dream Team combo of power tools and water those two goes so nicely together and not to mention the whole things held on by some flimsy ahus hot glue that could yes oh it's not good oh my god I didn't even get the whole awesome in in frame they just couldn't be

don't tell you why you'd want that is it like their toothbrush alternative like a cat it said of brushing your teeth you can just sponge them chip just rub a sponge or longer they don't even bother saying why is this thing you can do it you can put toothpaste in there you can it can be done okay like you know this is this is actually kind of a profound statement on humanity isn't it we we've
