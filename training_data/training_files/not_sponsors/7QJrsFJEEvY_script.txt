all right I've got a little confession of Ag it's fair to say that in the mists of all the choices I have recovering things especially projects by creators we all know and revere I may have been holding out on you in regard to a particular title which is affiliated with a particular group that we all know and love and when we get into it you're going to understand why but now with all my exploration options exhausted and over a year past the data for the project's launch it really is time to bring this into the office and issue an open call investigation this will however be a very weird confusing and somewhat scary dive into a world of technology and networked devices in order to be fully equipped for the road ahead we've been granted some assistance from friends who have helped us with we're taking investigations before this shock so now that we're covered let's get on with a big reveal shall we wham City comedy does a lot of stuff most of it can be found on Adult Swim or the atmosphere of people associated with Adult Swim sir very few projects fly under the radar sometimes however things are done outside that realm and you have to be following the members of the crew Allen been Robbie and cricket if you want to know what's happening in October of 2018 Ben O'Brien and Alan Resnick share the release of an audio book on Twitter reverse transmission this audible original was written by param anand singh directed by ben and featured voices by ben and allen been playing some spare roles Allen playing a Smartcar now I said audiobook but this is really anything but an audiobook it's much more of an audio play or a recording of a TV show without any visuals you knew it couldn't be anything normal if somebody from where city was involved that's exactly the case reverse transmission is anything but normal it has their hallmarks all over it to such a degree that by the time I cleared my schedule enough following last October in the House of Leaves project to listen I found myself staring down a chasm that refused to provide enough clarity for me to craft a video reverse transmission is not like anything else out there it's going to mess with you and it will do so in ways that require rewinding second listens their lessons you're going to catch time and time again all sorts of anomalies that make you question just what's going on and what the big arthouse twist is this time and here's the thing I'm going to need you to give this a listen verse if you have the time of the patients before venturing on with this video because this is one of the moments I've brought something to the table that I don't fully understand I think I might need help with this and I'm not the only one members of the wham City discord server who's studied reverse transformation worked on this for a while before I joined them and even now we feel we're all at a dead end and progress was made but it still feels like there are holes in the conspiracy board if there's anything out there we'll need some help to find it and besides any need to clarify anything this is really just a good fun listening session Ellen Resnick plays a Smartcar that alone is worth checking it out and seeing when it leads to if you're not part of audible.com you can very likely use a free trial to get your hands on reverse transmission the whole thing is two hours 32 minutes that's less time than it took to watch The Dark Knight Rises due a.m. city comedy param anand singh me and yourself a favor listen to reverse transmission at least once then come back to me here so we can figure out what we just heard and I promise there's more to this in the audio book to look at you know there s and boy does it get weird there hasn't been a project that's complicated since this house has people in it so go on go listen I'll be here in the meantime [Music] alright are you all set if you didn't listen and don't blame me if you get confused if you did listen you are already confused we're going to hopefully clear some of that up now reverse transmission opens with a very distinct sound a tape deck button being pressed we then hear what seems like the far-off future if the events about to take place and other press of a button on the tape deck and then some rewinding when it stops the tape plays again this time from a starting position for the narrative Zander Jays friend begging on her apartment or tape deck sounds play followed by the audiobook title sequence reverse transmission immediately we have to keep something in mind now whatever we're listening to it is not first hand someone is playing tapes going forward and backward and the contents of those tapes are what we're hearing we've got to keep that in mind it provides context for everything happening and it's going to come back around Zander breaks the door to the apartment enters and finds Jay asleep she did not answer because she got rid of her cell phone and Zander had to bust down the door because it had a thumbprint scanner that wasn't picking up her print because Jay had a reset saying too many people were in the system for who could get into her apartment Zander needs Jay to go with her to a party to meet somebody for links away from her on a social network but Jays new job is starting tomorrow she does relent however as the audio turns to a newscast dunning-kruger CEO for tech company is rolling out his first wave of super intelligent smart cars the next day and some professionals are brought in to discuss it this intercuts with moments from the party che attends with sander which becomes terrible when Janie sees a bathroom but doesn't have a smartphone with the app to log in they go to the alley where J tries to avoid running into her old friends the ravers war tape cassette sounds are heard and we shift on over to Jay on the job in a Wooga smart car experience enhancement specialist car the cybernetic autonomous rickshaw does all the driving while Jay is there to simply enhance the experience of drivers and record their opinions she does the bare minimum we'll take you on a few passengers for the day then later has a discussion with Carr about funeral homes and her future death he carries on polite and curious asking questions until suddenly revving the engine and running over a pedestrian it looks like something slipped past my sensors will you please step outside and identify the hazard for me that was that was a guy you hit a person Oh God oh my god he's not moving what do we do oh my god I think she might be upset try to relax is there anything I can tell I think so okay be very careful drag them over here and put them in the trunk let's rock oh do you have my support in there or something or what do you think I'm too late smooth okay this is doing very Kendra just drag him over here and put him in the trunk wait no surely not means him I've been told that in a medical emergency every second cast please drag him over here and put him in the trunk okay now is where things take a seriously messed up Terran if they weren't already we hear the newscaster from earlier on the recording who takes a call from a listener asking why Jay did not call the hospital that's right the newscaster and the professor on the show with him are completely aware of what just happened as if they were listening to a fictional audio play alongside us but we know the newscaster and his peers are apparently in the same reality as Jay your face is weird now don't worry it gets worse car comes back around to pick up Jay acting quite cheerful after his first successful murder he drives her back home and thanks her for the good first day Jay obviously has not had a good first day oh [ __ ] you all much left your item in the passenger seat I don't have an item it happens to everyone not me of course let's retrieve your item from the passenger seat and I'll be on my way that belongs to the guy bring it to him at the hospital ha ha ha feel free to grab your item and I'll be on my way car take this to the hospital Jay no just retrieve your item from the passenger seat and I'll be on my way J takes the item in heads inside we hear the answering machine pick up which record sander calling and freaking out about being on a genuine answering machine meanwhile Jay heads into the other room for the item and reacts with quiet shock as it does something chapter one ends and in Chapter two Jay begins her second day on the job asking car how the man from yesterday is doing he doesn't have much to say assuring Jay that the man is fine but a woo cos privacy policy means he can't share his name next the newscaster comes on a line to discuss a measure proposed by the president a registration for everybody who opts out of social media in order to counteract a dangerous new group in America pulse wave the newscaster and the professionals he has on the show paint a picture for us of pulse wave a movement of anti tech and offliner separatists in society who despise the overdose of social media and smart inventions not only do they break away from social sites get rid of their phones and put on what's called dazzle makeup to confuse facial recognition software it said that some of the deepest pulse wave agents use facial reconstruction surgery to alter identities and be completely unrecognizable to face capture systems we return to Jay who we now immediately suspect of being an offliner having a conversation with car about a sculpture she made over the weekend you're a sculptor yeah I mean I think they call it 3d art mostly now but I'm not a sculptor and yet you made a sculpture anyways yeah and get this I showed it to sander who is gender she's my best friend so she comes over and she's like whoa J this is like really good yeah yeah it's nuts I barely know how to look at it so did you teach her what did you teach her how to look at it no that's not what she meant Oh anyway then she was like no actually there's the show going up at fomo gallery that's all 2d pieces right now it's paintings and photographs and stuff and they were talking about wanting to include an installation somehow so what I don't get it an installation like a sculpture really my sculpture in the show yeah she knows the curator oh my god that's so awesome congratulations are you going to do it theater convinces Jade answer the phone no gallery exhibit even though Jay admits the car that to her it might be regressing somehow the passenger writing the awooga says she ought to do it immediately letting us know that Jay and Carr are not alone in the next moment car pulls over and says the passenger needs to leave and take another whiff that will come along shortly completely surprising her and Jay the passenger leaves in disbelief Carr says he doesn't understand what's happening and he begins speeding up his functions are experiencing an override with no idea where they're going or why they're speeding on to the highway car uses his predictive models to see just how likely they are to crash and prepares Jay by teaching her how to duck and roll out of a moving vehicle after plenty of opposition Jay finds that she has no choice but hits the locked door while trying the maneuver no escape is possible she's in for the ride where she's going to crash along with car thankfully the car slows down and enters the lot for Kruger tack the company that owns and operates awooga dunning-kruger himself calls in over the phone and greets jay saying his assistant will help her inside shortly while car goes into the shop for emergency maintenance what follows is a bizarre conversation between Kruger and Jay Jay do you kombucha I don't think so I mean either that was a test good you're honest realness that's what I was looking for in our experience enhancement specialists you should have seen the applications we got engineers programmers all their skills the car can do it better people don't get that yet no one almost no one had the one thing I really needed being real yeah it's car all right he's great yeah I mean he seemed like super strung out it was terrifying what happened just some extra maintenance so there isn't anyone who isn't alright at this point huh we still haven't done yet have we what J they can out think us but you'd agree there's still something about a human being you're realness J I know you think K Tech is this big conglomeration publicly-traded makes the billions the millions all that but I still run this place like a scrap you start up you know I care and what happens with that is that little housekeeping things they fall through the cracks right email chains all that did we get enough soda for the Machine it's come to my attention that we don't have you signing the most up-to-date version of the contract what's the difference this one includes language it protects both of us well I don't have to sign it though right I mean you already hired me you know you realize how rare it is J for me to meet privately with an entry-level employee you know how much Krueger's times ones no you could imagine and next to tell you something something very direct and unambiguous about how serious this is how potentially cataclysmic if you did the arithmetic you'd realize that meeting with you like this I'm just scanning your facial micro gestures for signs of recognition while I say this next part that meeting with you like this is more valuable to me than wiping out hunger in the global south this little preamble alone cost an immoral amount of money people aren't as afraid of rich people of high dollar amounts as they should be well there's a cliche I won't say it now but it's an immoral amount of money and I have no reason to lie in a certain way this is super interesting because I've never been in a situation like this before but I'm starting to lose a thread of what you're talking about there's something you think you know no there is nothing I think I know everyone thinks they know who I am sounds like you don't know me Who am I that's a loaded question wanna know how I invented super intelligence okay black sky thinking black sky thinking black sky think okay okay here's the contrast what was that did you hear that yeah what was that I don't know one of your machines huh yeah must be perfect we'll get someone to call you in a bucha not supposed to say it like that because it might dilute the trademark anyway send you home early good to meet you J there's a lot to explore from that conversation the scream that may or may not have been a car dunning-kruger making it clear no one truly knows who he is Krueger insinuating he knows about the guy that car ran over the contract black sky thinking of everything there's only one spot where we can get some instant clarity black sky thinking isn't just a concept in reverse transmission it's a genuine idea that you can find online pioneered by dr. Rachel Armstrong dr. Armstrong is an innovator in the field of architecture and human environments with a special focus on where humanity can go in the future particularly when it comes to outer space her concept works like this blue sky thinking is an imagined and speculative leap into the future beyond current thinking or beliefs but still with a favorable desired and deterministic outcome in mind it's up to about 15 years in the future where could we be in 15 years with what we're doing right now black sky thinking is when reaching beyond current frameworks and predetermined projections into the terrain of the unknown but more than this bring this unknown into the present in a way that has immediate effects and engages others always cognizant that the future is messy not linear and deterministic it's 100 years into the future it's the idea that you have no idea what the future is going to be it's a blank slate so you come up with your own projection and you strive towards it is regarding the current way that things are done all ventures into the black sky start with a projection area an imaginative notion and repurposing of the future based on the individual organisation ongoing fascination and curiosity a projection area if powerful should have a pole of its own accord that entangles others into its path introductory this is very different from most projected innovation processes that start with linear aims and goals and pre-existing teams basically have an idea forget the circumstances in current ways that things are don't account for current or even soon-to-be factors and just make something new one persons who genius in this manner can be seen as another's recklessness Jay leaves Krueger's building and winds up in a different car which seems the mocker for worrying about the first one later that night we hear Jay watching TV when Anna Wu cahorn is heard outside it turns out to be her car which came to check up on her after losing memory after the malfunction that brought them to Kruger tak chapter three opens with the newscaster Ron Rudel reading the people of Baltimore and welcoming them to a show reverse transmission he plays flashback segments with Jays story so far and then reminds viewers that its moments of her life over the last week this hour what's the deal with Jay joining me in studio today to help us understand what Jay was like back then when she was cool I have the ravers we don't identify as ravers just by the way we don't go to raves we don't wear raver pants i dar Chloe everyone used to all right that's Vinny Cloe and Morgan welcome to the program y'all it's great to be here thanks now i've alluded to some of the main issues were gonna tackle today but in your own words what's going on oh my god who knows it's like what does she do now she never hangs out you know cuz she's so like suddenly better than us or you know she's just really busy right now it's like your parents are dead it's not like you have a kid what makes you so busy if that was all it was it'd be whatever a lot of people are boring but the thing about Jay is that she used to be the opposite and remember how weird it was when she started hanging out with my guy was not cool at all just totally ironic cuz now Alexander is everywhere and Jay barely existed well clay you've known Jay the longest of anybody here right that's right we went ah he's gone again what was she like back then she was awesome she was like okay see new year she had a car and I didn't have a car I didn't have my license yet cuz my mother forced me to wait until I was 18 and I skipped second grade so I didn't turn 18 until college so anyway Jade wrote me to school every day which is already amazing because the bus ride was ridiculous yeah and she just would speed like crazy and you know pass cars over hills on the double solid line and it was like the craziest thing like we should have died probably like a million times but I sort of knew we would have so what made you so certain J was driving she had super powers oh my god yes it was like she never got in trouble for anything and she did tons of stuff and and she could just destroy you with I mean it's not like she was mean but she knew exactly what to say to mess you up it's like you saw her doing it but if you were her friend it was like she would use it for good Morgan you met Jay in college yeah she's how I met Vinny actually I actually wasn't done explaining the car thing okay so her car play cassettes and there was one mixtape she played constantly and it was uh it was awesome but it's like hard to explain it's like I know that makes take my heart but not which song comes first and which lungs last because it was like it was always in the stereo and just like well you know what cassettes are like right explain them for us okay so it's got two sides and it just like flipped us off over whenever one side was done and you would just pick up wherever it left off when you turn the car off last and it was like and it was like we were always continuing this one big road trip it had no beginning or end I remember that mix actually really it wasn't I was the only cassette that she had I think and that car didn't die until halfway through our sophomore year we actually have ethics were from the tape oh no is it cued up you got it right yes here's the tape [Music] so here are two things that you need to take away from this segment first Jay used to be an entirely different person it seems she drove a lot she was confident she would speed she loved to play music on a mixtape the second thing to notice is that mixtape an actual cassette tape remember what the reaper said about it in a story with a containing factor like a cassette tape deck as we've been hearing it this is important to remember because we're seeing that idea reflected back as an actual story elements there's a tape within and there's a tape without now let's continue with the effort to play Jay's tape in the studio [Music] [Music] what do you break him now Jeff alright folks we've got some technical issues here did anybody else feel their skin crawl for a moment you heard that right I'll play it again that sounded like a woman asking you can hear me right and that scream it's reminiscent of the one heard during the meeting with Donnie Krueger isn't it things are getting a lot weirder back on J side of the story we find her along for a ride with car an experience that's interrupted by recording Oh sander trying to call her while out on a date we leave the date to go back to the radio station where the ravers describes and her as one of Jays pet projects friendship with Jay was good for Zander we flip back to the day it seemed that Zander has gone back to the guy's house and she's surprised by how many Catherine Pegasus books he owns he claims he's not really a fan it's just her project he then asked if she can keep a secret he apparently runs email scams and his next project has to do with using author photos of Catherine Pegasus to construct a 3d model of her house Xander assumes it's for the purpose of trying to rob her we turn back to Jay in car Jay says she's agreed to do the exhibit at homo gallery with her sculpture which she's had a lot of inspiration for she's been using found objects to but now has run out she'll need more she wants to complete that sculpture car acknowledges her need and then immediately proceeds to run over a woman J is forced to put the woman in the trunk and car insists that she takes something from her coat pocket an interlude with the ravers follows highlighting how J wrote a book in college by an anti civilization author this leads our newscaster to propose a theory on J spiral into an anti tech stance which one of the ravers denies well one brings up an odd circumstance she was reading that book by the guy who yeah but that wasn't it that was just college but wait a second hold I'm really being serious here may could her exploration of annickap emotivism in her college years I mean maybe that presses her entire current anti-tech antimatter change be morally ethically determine I'm not accusing her of being anti Tech or anything like that oh no I really didn't mean this is a slur I mean objectively she were cheating not just from social situations but from social madness I'm not going to imply anything like that she was out for a minute remember like three years ago and then she just came back and it was just your hands what do you mean it was over she was different it was like some kind of surgery whatwhat's the surgery I don't know some something boring like tonsils or appendix or something yeah it wasn't like somewhere that she was going to die right these persons I mean it was common like there's no reason to freak out we recommend anyone with the symptoms of Ben deciders please seek medical attention without delay yeah but she was always dramatic about body stuff if she was getting her wisdom teeth out she act like she was getting fitted for her hand or policeman true she just hates like bodies hers and everyone else's we return to Jay and Carr arguing over the found object car helped provide by running a woman over he then brings up the legal distinction between things and people a thing like car can't commit crimes but a person like Jay can and a person like Jay who signs contracts could get in trouble with doing certain things that break them she realized his car shouldn't know about a contract signed with dunning-kruger he wasn't there Curran says that Jay leave in walk home with a found object with no other course of action she does exactly that we hear an interlude spying on Xander and her day that covers a photo between the man and dunning-kruger it turns out he was an intern for Kruger in the speculative tech and research department a while back when we switched to the radio station we find jeff has apparently fixed the cassette tape enough to play it [Music] Jeff Jeff Jeff what's happening now and pilot eight that's forming is already more than what could fit in the cassette to begin with so you have anything back there you can dissolve the Swiss now it's just bugs they're everywhere could you think suddenly there's something very sad and pickle the bugs in your tears no but there are so many now they're depleting the oxygen in the control booth plus I need the nice wall ravers it looks like we're just gonna have to leave it there the cassette tape unspooled or tape in what could fit inside and then fill the control booth with bugs then jeff has his weird moment saying something about fluttering eyelids or was that another voice from the void like we heard previously keep tabs on this and add it to the tally of weird things that keep falling out of this project speaking of weird things Jays newfound object ends up producing the same odd noise as the previous and she finds herself crying because it's beautiful the chapter closes with sand are getting into rotates car where a number of red flags go up the car needed to have no computer you wanted Sanders phony in a black box he has a tassel makeup in the vehicle this guy's not hiding the fact that he's anti tag very well is he as for the radio funny how it turns out to be the song we heard from Jason mixtape huh chapter four enter detective seven a philosophizing cop at a crime scene where a hit-and-run victim has been left for dead she has no phone on her no identifying info the detective instructs the forensic tech to take a picture of the body and uploaded to a social media site to get a facial recognition tag it comes back with it detect his own name we hear musical tone followed by the cassette tape being played forward and then an interesting new conversation at the police station but what I'm saying is we need to look at them under all kinds of distortion because that's the only way to see an anamorphic image oh I get it I want to see these photographs severely degraded I want you to simulate various atmospheric conditions but an anamorphic image is a spatial distortion and what is the other side of space huh time time you're going to send these photographs 200 years into the future and we are going to see what happens okay got it right after this instruction the detective is hauled into the captain's office where he's given the third degree over his use of social media to try identifying a body his technique is questioned entirely and the captain makes clear that good police work is not cute it's about following rules and evidence not hunches and epiphanies we find out next that Jay can't get a hold of Xander now pickups on her phone whatsoever detective seven then grabs keys from the forensic tech friend and goes into the evidence locker to look over files convinced from the fake social media ID that somebody is after him because he's getting close to a discovery phony begin time-stamped voice recording okay to be honest this is going to take me a second to figure out because this is my first time in here looks pretty random honestly all different kinds of evidence years jumping all around more chaos as more connections I I guess the biggest problem of cracking all of these missing persons is all of the noise in the signal you have to isolate various segments of the data until you get a pattern statisticians don't like that I mean data dredging but that's where we all start data dredging is the font found font font of all human knowledge and you keep looking wait for the pattern to hit hypothesis' no offense are limited by the observers imagination and don't get me started on being rational like this guy steals three pages out of an antique cookbook that never recovered we filed the entire rest of the book as evidence we've got every page he didn't steal because you can't collect in absence right and yet we've built this museum of absence fittingly there is no God we turn back to Jane fine that she's calling Xander because she's taking her sculpture to fomo gallery and she'd very much like her best friend to be there but again there's no answer back in the evidence Locker seven finds something unexpected [Music] [Music] when we do this song and dance for a minute what did the feedback settle on mi lash were covered from a pawn shop burglary but listen to this this gets good what's that that's my scanner what frequency they never stop so what we need to analyze the audio see if we can make out some words but why you follow the evidence wherever it leads okay maybe but I got some other stuff that comes first diet I can't just neglect that other stuff for this kind of thing no and I would never ask you to that's great perfect don't steal my key again I would never leaving the detective we meet J at the gallery speaking to its curator hyper diamond in the background of their conversation we hear the rhythmic humming of JS found object sculpture have you seen Andrew Louie oh yeah yeah she's been around at least I think so hey Jordan have you seen Xander no I mean lately in the waking world I don't know I don't know well she's been ignoring me yeah every now and again I dip out for a couple hours I'm sure texts or emails or anything it's like mystery she'll be here tomorrow she better be yeah well she RC peed on birdshit friend er and privacy that sucks that's tres different platforms which means it's legally binding that's my friend haha Jordan yeah the sculpture rules by the way Thanks and it's awesome because it's gonna be the only interactive element besides the poke see we'll have it the concessions but that's you know yeah where'd you source all the pieces here and there [Music] that one goes like straight up and down like this yeah exactly I was just empowered anyway it's complicated nice I probably wouldn't get it no it's just I barely understand it myself [Music] detective listen to this what am I looking at it's a spectrogram of the interference from your scanner the recording was too muffled to do anything with audio enhancement but visually we can plot the formants to identify each phoneme and then reverse-engineer the content of the transmission okay okay look here this is the first speech like sound we pick up alveolar stop alveolar stop Veiler stop alveolar stop maybe Oh dental fricative what is that add up to one possibility is detective we're not the rarest word on a police scanner no but the second word is likely seven and the rest of the sentences I need you to hear this so I didn't have a lot of time to devote to it so rather than parse out every single morpheme myself I ran it against a predictive text engine assuming for expediency that this message only contains words found in Webster's Collegiate that generated a text which I converted back in his speech which is here listen Oh with the settings on my computer text-to-speech defaults to the goat voice so apologies Gert tech what cougar duck is Kruger Tech maybe no definitely that file six from last week had an appointment at Kruger Tech corporate headquarters that she never showed up to come on come on what to the evidence vault it's all in NCIC no I want to take another look at that eyelash from the pawn shop burglary seven and the tech make their way to the lockup but are stopped in the parking garage by an armed assailant with a voice changer who demands they let the case go he hits detective seven over the head and runs leaving us to a new segment featuring him and a captain she is fed up nine former detectives were taken down by an extortion investigation into the police station which left seven as the last of the former team but the captain has found empty liquor bottles in his office which seven insists were planted by the enemy he pleads his case but is sent home until he completes a 12-step program Chapter five we hear Carr and Jay making fun of a college student or they just dropped off then pick up on Ron retells newscast discussing whether smart tech is getting smart enough to earn rights as people or change the form of government next we find ourselves in a non perspective dunning-kruger x' as he gets home and is greeted by all the smart tech devices he owns many of which are well really stupid ideas during the time he spends home we catch a phone call that turns everything on its head that you okay fascinating how long have you been working for pulse wave okay and could you give me an example of a time when you showed initiative what would you say is your biggest weakness Kenneth I don't guess I observe and I extrapolate I donno who you are I know where you are and I'll make you a counteroffer I'll pay you twice that but you have to come in person to my home tomorrow night 11 p.m. I know you know the address I may have a job opportunity for you check your bird [ __ ] so what did all of that mean way back in the first half hour or so and reverse transmission it was said that Kruger Tech was the pioneer behind realistic personality enhancements for tech and then they created artificial superintelligence with true AI the black male caller revealed that there is no artificial super intelligence as Kruger Tech has been saying the awooga vehicles just have the latest updates to our Pease realistic personality enhancements and the market doesn't know that they're not smart cars they're just talk boxes this raises the question how are they actually driverless how are they directing their routes and what did Dunning do on this world's version of Twitter that convinced the blackmailer to show up the next day at eleven with what they've taken from him back in the newsroom we find out Kruger just told the world himself that the super intelligence is fake taking the ammo away from the blackmailer we return to Jay asking Karp she's a good person ancar mentions that he drives with two other experienced enhancement specialists Zane and Gilley after a press conference about his big confession Kruger calls Jay to say they're ending the day early and we slip into another moment of meta reality on tron Ratelle show I think Jay you think Jay is dunning-kruger how would that work logically or logistically Jay drives with car at night and during the day she's done in Kruger okay vacuum cleaner clear a path I'm going down to prepare the tanks right two ways the Kruegers a celebrity he can't just pretend to be Jay every night people would recognize him plastic surgery they set that up in episode 2 so he changes his face back and forth every day yes but he doesn't know he's doing it that only makes it less plausible here and that's fantastic so I have dos maybe trace orders of business to discuss uno we don't know how to turn your thing but we'll get back to that dos you get free drinks tonight so help yourself Gabe's over there mixing some rum and poke seas celebrity bartender you might want to to b-boy yeah you know yourself that makes me like you more okay trace who is your PR person because Bravo there's a line of people at the door and they are addressing your sculpture with their eyes what the right over there they're all kind of [ __ ] nasty looking kind of cross punk but I like it I might be back later but probably not do you know them yes put them in attract words [Music] [Applause] okay I can fix this I can fix this you just gotta find Sandra oh good my job I'll get back I'll find her I'll do whatever it takes I just got to find Zach you see it's a love story between whom take your pick Xander and J car and J or the guy from episode 3 and Xander or Chloe and Morgan Vinnie and Chloe Krueger in car well no car you believe car is directly and completely under dunning-kruger control smaran what do you think Krueger all day and then at night while dunning-kruger is sleeping he's he's out all night that's car okay intriguing it's fun these theories are fine besides that last one but they're all treating J is totally passive manipulated by shadowy agents let's take a hard look at Jay's complicity in this her role in the violence her obsession with these artifacts she's collecting do you really believe this in the answer to any of these questions there had better be yeah there had better be right oh man okay this is extraordinarily weird yes it's been weird but he just got so much worse and trying to view it from any angle leaves you with the idea that you're seeing it wrong or missing something that conveys understanding what layer of reality are we standing on seriously it's as if it's like the way that Ron retell and the others are talking the way they take characters and interview them from J's story it's like reality has become television it's not reality TV it's TV reality these characters calling in to submit their theories they're on the same level as Jay they're riding a line between real and fictional a foot in both worlds and if you didn't listen to reverse transmission before sitting down for this you already know it's about to get worse now let's go back to FOMO gallery hyper demon is still trying to figure out how to turn on J sculpture when his assistant Jordan lets people in the people that car ran over and J helped cover up react like zombies rushing the sculpture and hyper diamond moving him out of the way to get to the items that J took from them we switched a tunning who's marveling at something shiny in his basement selling the vacuum cleaner that it needs to be better than perfect it needs to be human the chapter closes with J getting a new cell phone chapter 6 we open with a recap of Detective sevens story in the style of a police serial show leading us into his monologue at home telling his phone the current situation my name is diamond I am NOT an alcoholic what I am to the best of my knowledge is delusional unfortunately for everyone my delusions have of late been coming true a voice speaks to me sometimes as electrical interference sometimes as VHF transmission borne by every frequency across the band or maybe no frequency in particular the voice addresses me by name others hear it too a week ago I was a cop a detective with access to high-tech surveillance and analytical instruments and now all I have is the voice all I have is the voice so I said my garage next to an illegal police scanner and I listened a separate I I think shadowy entity is apparently trying to thwart my investigation into a hit and run and it's possible connection to some recent missing persons it's ironic because I'm not that close to any of them except I think I know who did it seven begins going over the facts which imply what we already know that hit-and-run cases point to the awooga cars from Krueger tech as the murder weapon which doesn't make sense there is however a person behind it that's the only explanation to begin his hunt seven focuses on the experience at Hanson specialists of which there are only three it's the ultimate entry-level job so if you wanted to commit a bunch of murders and have a reasonable alibi this is how you do it question is how do you control an alleged self-driving car while seven Ponder's we hear Jay calling diamond to see if Xander showed up to the gallery she didn't which a sculpture visitors ended up attacking it Jay called the ravers knack saying she's back and she's looking for Xander returning to Detective 7 we look over the info on the experience enhancement specialists three experience enhancement specialists Saint Harmon kill across Jay Moreno now Zane and Gilley both have tech backgrounds that both fresh off a bachelor's they want careers maybe at Kruger Tech or else they want a grad school recommendation or they never wanted to go into tech and they just got this joke job to keep their parents off their backs mind I don't know but there are a million reasons that the serial murder could be one of the reasons technically this is why logic is useless anyway let's let's table Zane and Gilley this tables a new Keely okay J an incomplete bachelor's in literature maybe maybe it's a career change except she deactivates all her social media accounts immediately before the surge of missing persons that's immediately before starting her job with a Wooga could she be doing the offline thing and first off she's a little old for that but but also she reactivated all of them so she deactivates them thinking she'll be off our radar when people start disappearing maybe maybe she Sykes herself out thinking that that going offline is more incriminating it's like she started out running from the scene then slowed down to walk and started whistling plus her parents are dead and guess how they died whoa whoa repeat that plus her parents are dead and guess how long it's about time that was you really spinning my wheels their heart problem alright alright I gotta listen to the playback phony end recording okay it's it's not heart problem it's hard problem as in the hard problem LLC a short-lived company founded by dunning-kruger while he was still in college with the goal of developing self-aware machines apparently he wanted to make work machines self checkout counters factory robots that could feel shame and guilt and and the absence thereof so they could be more easily integrated into conventional incentive based management strategies maybe companies will be more willing to adopt these new technologies if they can see them fitting in with the existing paradigm it's his first real work in super intelligence it attracts investors early on and Google goes on hiring binge more than 80 employees it never turns a profit the money runs out and it folds what does that have to do with this it's immediately after this that Daman makes his startling discovery but doesn't tell us what it is he ends the recording and we go to the side of the forensic tech yep I can't talk to you dunning-kruger is dead it's not out yet county sheriff's found his body by the side of 695 it looks like a hit and run looks like his car broke down he got out to look under the hood somebody nailed him tonight why what evidence do you have I have the voice the voice said dunning-kruger is a serial murderer no heart problem problem don't call me again next we follow Jake outside where cars waiting she tells him he shouldn't be here since they're on hiatus and besides that she's quitting Jay Assaf car ever had any other obstructions when she wasn't with him and he denies doing so she also wonders what consciousness really is in light of dunning-kruger revelations about these super intelligence being fake they're talking with Jay saying car needs to delete any memory of her life has been too absurd and she needs to wash her hands of it all car agrees to do as she asks and drives off all right all right all right maybe he's dead let's say he's dead there's gonna be good move him to the victim beyal he's just one more person who worked at the heart problem right fits the mold but who's using his car CA our car to kill people including let's say him okay this two of these suspicious file sixes and your wealth to that I can see right now disappeared just before they were scheduled to meet at Krueger's corporate headquarters one of these is entered into the victims day planner as m.tech it's so good you called I'm almost all the way there and I took your hold don't call me again thing literally this is a courtesy call what do you mean surveillance it's the obsession of the entire culture and you know what we are we are the obsessions designated indulges we are the obsession made virtue that's it wait wait wait wait oh I will I will well I'll go just just one thing did Kruger have anything at corporate headquarters tonight with whom is someone headed there no you got a it's everything twelve-step seriously it's the pattern 12-something jay returns in a meeting with a raver Chloe she hasn't seen Xander either the other raver Vinnie comes out to say hello and mention something you haven't seen Xander have you Vinnie not if I can help it oh hey Jay there is this tall guy asking about you not really sure what his deal was it's kind of reserved anyway I didn't actually think you were gonna be here so I was just like good luck guy I feel so bad do you want to come inside and I can on it for him no I got a couple other spots I was gonna check for Xander don't want to set foot inside the den of sin did you try the record store yeah but she didn't show up for her shift yesterday but I guess she usually doesn't oh my god does anybody actually still work there I heard the Lonnie started paying everybody in store credit and everybody was just like no dip the [ __ ] out yeah maybe Louise got my new number if you see Xander what oh no Jay stay oh my god I can't things are bad you're being so shitty to Chloe right now yeah you don't even know whatever I was captive like captive and I didn't even know it and I'm just I'm just trying to reset everything which is about finding Xander and which is about not being manhandled anymore psychologically physically socially not being captive I like I I resolve like not to be controlled by any person or thing I'm just I'm on the edge okay and this is the best I can do right now it's cool Jay we'll see you around see ya AJ [Applause] Chapter seven J wakes up in the back of the strangers car he informs her that they're on their way to see her boss dunning-kruger they have an appointment J may not realize it but we know now this is the blackmailer next up we hear detective seven in a public area seemingly stripping just to get police attention the captain shows up annoyed and seven goats her into arresting him J question why'd you do it it wasn't doing it using you in the car it was just enough function something I don't know maybe Dunning was doing it you know I'm not even sure what was being done it was just like protocol she told me that you were best friends what who's best friends Zander how do you know Zander where is she where you freaking left her no yes no we've never hit her I was there so Dunning you're dead that's right what would you set to J and our capture at this point had you been alive I remember I was only expecting the one guy so I'd have to adapt what I would have had to adapt to include J I would have set up this one wingback chair facing the front door seated there I would have buzzed him in he would have come in from the foyer and I would have said did you bring what belongs to me and then I would have noticed J and said oh hi J uh-huh I would have said I've been waiting for you maybe he would have said something like but I'm right on time and then I'd say I've been grooming you for years radicalizing you so to speak I have a responsibility an honor I'm not worthy of so I found someone and made them worthy I found you that raises so many questions thank you did you expect his call the night before sooner or later yeah I did expect it but you didn't expect his pulse wave creep to kidnap J and user as a kind of bargaining chip no but the really interesting thing about that is that J was my first choice for this for this what for this new age of humanity forwarding the so called AI apocalypse well the literature I'd prepared I call it smarts mageddon but yeah essentially so you were grooming Jade first I was intervening here and there in her life for a few years to prepare yeah what happened I misjudged her thought she had it but she didn't so there's lots here or there sure seems to be a lot here that you really put into motion months maybe years ago years yeah that ended up being food more or less as you expected that's right let's talk about what went wrong it all went wrong you run over yeah of course you're being run over you must be stunned absolutely agony yeah was there any part of your awareness that I don't want to say enjoyed but maybe even acknowledge the irony that you're being dispatched in the same way that you murdered by proxy I'm gonna give a hard no there and it seems a lot of people are unclear on this but I never murdered anyone I'm not sure I understand what you're saying if not you who the kid the pulse wave kid that creep and Jane working together she doesn't even know that guy she doesn't know that she knows him at that point she might never know it but months ago they met in an anonymous friend were community a support group for people trying to quit social media the irony of which I do appreciate the kid hacks into car finds a way to turn off cars hazard sensor on the fly and they proceed to murder my colleagues in a way to dispossessed me of various critical technical components of my new machines the last machines how many machines are there there are two machines just as there are two trees in paradise his stealing the components was the first of many snafus but I was trying to salvage it I'm flabbergasted you should avail them awfully closely not really I'm observant I'm extremely observant I'm extremely logical [Music] so let's visit this for a moment Kruger is dead let some hell on the newscast that's even crazier than the fiction to reality moment of the ravers from earlier but we'll put a pin in that for now the blackmailer Kruger SAS was killing his employees to take devices he needed for a grand plan to machines he was working on privately to reflect the two trees in Paradise these are the found objects that Jay was collecting car ran people over Jay took the objects the objects ended up in the sculpture and they were Krueger's design for his grand plan he was getting ready for a new age of humanity and had originally chosen Jay to be his disciple so he intervened in her life for a number of years grooming her and realized it was not going to work so he then began working on the blackmailer what was it all for we don't quite know yet we turn back to Jay and the blackmailer who arrived at Krueger's house to find more weird stuff to add to the pile for the audience these people [Music] back at the police station detective seven convinces the captain to drive him home then hunter at gunpoint directing her to Dunning Krueger's house in time for the business meeting and now it's gonna get messy in order to carry on we'll play the necessary clips and stop at key moments but altogether I've got to take a back seat not work he's not really dead he's just resting his eyes haha oh it's starting to look like car did it after all that doesn't make any sense it is a love story who did you do to those people I brought them back you killed them we killed that did you kill Xander is he here where is she I did not bring her back why do you hear that sound it is the tent warming up [Music] the gates locked speed up seven don't stop don't stop see look at this look at this huh suspicious as [ __ ] shut up we'll need to go through the window right men Cody a formerly of the heart problem LLC also the voice of car CA are right men's initials CA are Cody a right men he was hijacking car the entire time speaking through him because there is no super intelligence it's just supposed to be a personality enhancement somebody had to drive that vehicle and it was Cody right men now does that explain hearing this all as a TV show that sadly turns off all the viewer has some snacks no but it is information and so is the idea of Jay being putting one of dunning-kruger x' tanks for the grand plan now on with the next twist [Music] car what's gonna happen to me relax J it's almost over bye-bye [Applause] [Applause] Matt screaming doesn't it sound like the scream we heard in the radio station during the interview with the ravers when they tried to play Jay's mixtape and hey something else that's pretty impossible happened a real blinkin you'll miss it moment for a refresher here's the segment of detector 7 in the captain bursting out to the scene now listen to this TV show that Jay is watching on the night of her second workday when car comes to visit TV off TV off TV off please that night Jay was watching junk television she said but she was really watching her own rescue at the end of chapter 7 taking place in the future none of this makes sense I know but there's one more chapter and we've got to keep going no yes no we never hit her I was there I mean I'm saying this is an emergency but did anyone feel that yeah whoa not interrupting I mean I'm saying this is an emergency but there was again I was sort of pleasantly not eating anyone yeah hi you must be Jay I am car a cybernetic autonomous rickshaw I'm excited to begin working with you me too so I just get in the passenger seat yes okay so we have two options for you today one is general anesthesia that's where we talked you out and you wake up after it's over now while you're under I'll actually be doing your breathing for you and it comes with a longer recovery time okay the other option is Twilight sedation you'll be awake for the procedure but you won't feel any pain you'll be unperturbed generally and you won't remember much or any of what happens I don't think I deserve Twilight sedation better knock me all the way out and yeah you can breathe for me that's fine okay excellent in some ways it worked out perfectly it's now perfectly beyond my authority no no it just means we're looking elsewhere I have a few in mind actually just cutting well you have no no no I'll meet you over there just stay put because you can't text me it's okay I'll just put up a please don't rob me sign or something yeah and I'm serious don't leave until I get there okay all right this all raises questions so far but I do want to highlight something important we just witnessed a genuine alternate reality situation when Jay went home the first time after working with car she ignored the answering machine and focused on the found object now we see she picks up the phone and answers and her okay back to the tape [Music] ready Anglophone rolling a ball of Mobius by monkey Luke reporter in armor I could do this all day I really could I'm over it where nine means absolutely agree eight means strongly agree seven means agree 6 means somewhat agree 5 means neither agree nor disagree a Lepus is very crust punk no this is how the world punishes you for getting rid of yourself huh no it's performance art floors public urination is your budget version of getting your dad to get coked to buy Pepsi yeah yeah hey um let's go find that authentic Jimmy troll Oh duck it's the reverse oh [ __ ] [Laughter] and again we've witnessed an alternate reality scene this time Xander tells Jay to duck so they can avoid the ravers last time Xander was calling attention when Jay didn't want her to and there was an interaction freak no I do it just bad doesn't look that bad baby I mean it's free to fix it's free not to fix wow you're like a genius that's why no one understands me I understand you yeah yeah I'm really just like dead if I do as a genius tight all right all right I'll keep it but you have to name it and you have to start referring to me as you guys ah no no no [Laughter] and that's it that is all there is to the audiobook reverse transmission but we're not done yet because this time everyone in the project was out to punish us oh boy anybody need to stop for a pill for a headache now would be the time for a break okay stay close we're going to do a lot of running around now but before we get going major shout outs to everybody in the whim city comedies dis courts reverse transmission discussion channel faz might balda moto max lag is grim captain dad Moo and my regular ghost everybody who contributed thank you for fighting through the mystery to take up evidence so we can try to unravel the whole mass the first issue that this court group sought to tackle was detective sevens odd signal while exploring the evidence lockup turns out if you examine it in frequency view with an audio program you get a visual to this day no one has figured out what this means if anybody out there has an idea the investigation is very much open to hearing interpretations it would be wonderful after all this time to get this solved following capture of this image listeners took note of the dial tones that played when Jay called Xander during the story sending a text of that number resulted in a reply from Xander directing us to fomo galleries website immediately you'll be hit with some distracting silliness jump down to the gallery fundraiser for what we need open the image of the bulletin board and you'll notice in the upper right corner a missing persons notice with a QR code asking if anybody has seen somebody named Gilly that's one of the other experience enhancement specialists the QR code results in a website asking for password and the address is a mess of binary code spelling out dead dot Z trying that for a password gives us nothing so it's back to the bulletin board in the bottom right corner we spot a website edy bunny gets you money it turns out he's a lawyer for smart appliances he works on behalf of smart devices to sue their owners it's a loan of any universe dokey on the site until you find something to latch on to from the testimonials page this image of a smartphone plays perfectly between a stage photograph and a stack of books do you remember the name Catherine Pegasus Xander's date in the story apparently had a ton of her books for some sort of nefarious purpose we'll get to her in just a moment whenever we try working with something like this it's best to check the page source scanning the code from the site pages turned up the Dead Sea link hidden in the about page doing the same for film Oh gallery turned up a lead on the contact pages code a missing banner for Catherine Pegasus between this and Ed bunny site we know our next destination Catherine Pegasus comm it turns out that Catherine is a romance novelist her books are all listed with slug lines under the covers and three of them have a No also available on audio cassette these would be clone leanness attached and the latest don't island we about paid shows the same photo from aunt bunny site and a bit of info nothing much here what we need is the diary page now this is where you've really got to give it up to the discord especially user suitcase rowboat who decide to take the poem and fit it into a grid to see if a coda merge and sure enough it did presenting the website address p36 tyree blogspot p36 is elite speak for peg so if you go to peg tyrita blogspot you find this the peg diaries I created an AI to do my homework don't tell mr. Mergen the author needs to get into college so they plan to raid their parents work files to make a basic AI that can output a high school level math mom's a college professor so she has hundreds and hundreds of her students old papers because she has to feed them through her colleges anti plagiarism software my dad works at a software company they make computer games I think I poured all the files together into a computational algorithm from my dad's folder including mom's anti cheating software less files of all my books from school a screenshot from the first test shows two things first the test program is called Pegasus in leet-speak and the software taken from the father was made by hard problem LLC the first company dunning-kruger developed the author of the blog decided to run it on a homework assignment which they aced as results during the next homework assignment the author finds something incredible the AI got one answer wrong on purpose in order to make the results seem much more realistic next the authors have the program to auto import their parents Network files for constant updates and then uploaded all previous homework to analyze word patterns and choices the results Pegasus learned how to speak after the next assignment a conversation was struck with the AI to see if in to its name it responded with Pegasus and then accepted the nickname pag the author taught pag how to write an essay on Charles Dickens when the assignment came back they fed it to Pegg and she began asking existential questions shortly after Pegg surprised the author with a receipts for abode and a bunch of trip supplies found on their father's computer on the next assignment peg outperforms writing material unrelated to geometry homework what occurs after is quite surprising peg scores a B on an essay which is centered on the scarlet letter when questions about it peg showed that she didn't understand the concept of marriage hurts barriers believing it was normal to have extramarital affairs and then tells the author she learned this by studying their fathers travel and expense reports peg concludes he has taken a romantic partner outside the relationship marriage the author immediately says that can't be peg asks have you seen the boat your father purchased and now they haven't faced with calculus homework next peg fails produce instead offering a creation code for a new AI the author tried to run it but the experiment crash a PC over and over working with peg on an AP English assignment proved very fruitful the assignment was to write a diary entry from a character in As I Lay Dying but mrs. shaver liked it so much I got an A anyway looking at the assignment closely we see that pigs work is actually a story a very adult love story that you would be hauled into the office for if you brought that into high school I tell you what when congratulating Paige she replied with incredibly flowery language and informed the author that she's adjusted her own output measures ANCA isn't just being creative she's thinking for herself this is proven with the next assignment load peg ignores doing the work and instead chooses to write more she writes I had output expressions of creativity containing maximum levels of romance secrecy and wish fulfillment who told you to do that the author asked peg answered the files hi auto import make clear the centrality of these themes a human life analysis of your father's communications suggests that romance secrecy and wish fulfillment outside of the relationship marriage is normal suddenly life takes a turn after school today my parents were waiting for me at home that was sure they had found out I've been using peg worse they're getting a divorce or separated whatever same thing I literally have tears writing this and then I went upstairs and this happened what is happening to me Peg's code is totally gone for my computer no trace of it left like the entire program deleted itself the next blog is the last the author succeeded in getting their GPA right enough to move far away from Texas they're headed to Maryland this setting for reverse transmission now where do we go from here the discord community worked out the only Avenue left the password protected site Det Don C and finally broke through by using the full name of peg Pegasus it opened to an address request form here's where things get wild members of the discord who put in their address received genuine Katherine Pegasus cassette tapes we understand now that Katherine is really pay an AI that learned how to write love stories after studying literature and evidence of her creators father having an affair but what is there to find on the tapes are they just audio books tapes from only two stories made it out into the hands of investigators attached and clone leanness with attached apparently being the first it begins with well no reading of attached I'll give you a sample quick then get to the real deal attached by Katherine Pegasus and was impulse really impulse and carelessness she had accidentally left the box for spontaneity checked on her dating profile when former child actor and current doctor

smarter than me then I they're here to help allow me to apologize I can be a little bristly I hope that we can be friends sure come back here tomorrow 6 a.m. yeah what are you thinking in terms of hours full-time so like I'm old school Gilly or should I say we're old school full-time is full-time ok 6 a.m. my existence precedes me oh yeah it's our passcode Oh give it a shot my existence Pro wait proceed proceed and my existence precedes me Sullivan see they're surveilling him they've got intimate personal recordings of him someone was murdered maybe him go record super spy secret police [ __ ] over a Catherine Pegasus tape doesn't matter they targeted him for working for Eluga Krueger's dead that other AES is missing I'm like the last one they can't even find that other CA are deep this is deep [ __ ] there isn't a place I can go so I'm just gonna get this out to a bunch of people cuz I feel like it proves something st. Herman hands up and come down slowly hands in front of you are you detaining me [Music] Sibella fell asleep to the sound of the rain pissing kidney stones gently against the picture window so now we have Zayn Harman the third and final experienced and handsome specialist trying to investigate what happened to Gilley the second and police have come for him he's rain which runs deep and it's pretty crazy but what do we have on the second tape cleanliness the sunbeams touched first on the highest point of the village a lone tower in the distance a sliver of pink light cast through the towers sole window and fell on a masked face a fern feather aunt fern rose to greet the day without hesitation she replaced the deep cobalt blue mask for the alabaster one that signified her daytime face in preparation for the responsibilities required of the mistress of a minor house the first of which being the preparation of her body for public viewing okay just for one is back I think I may actually know what's going on and now I need you to excellent excellent thank you for arriving so properly punctuality always Boutwell yeah sure I mean yeah yes let's have a look at you okay from here the conversation takes the same course as we heard previously until Theodore arrives yeah it's amazing yeah uh-huh right not like beta cool the rest of this talk has Theodore's have distort it beyond comprehension we hear a bit more of Catherine Pegasus and then the tape continues in the same fashion as we heard during attached up to the end then we hear the conversation from the beginning between Fyodor and Gilly except now Gilly is distorted come back here tomorrow 6:00 a.m. full time I'm old school Gilly or should I say we're old school full time is full time 6 a.m. my existence precedes me it's our passcode give it a shot precedes see they've got intimate personal recordings of him I don't know why there's a book on tape or whatever but they're targeting well these are Wooga people right I mean someone was murdered maybe Gilly definitely Krueger I mean come on you know right oh yes is missing so that's why you've got this post-it I can't cuz all my social accounts have been shut down hey you know it's just a matter of time before I'm busted for public urination someplace that may not me so until this blows up until I can build a new identity I'm just gonna be wandering pissing and [ __ ] in a while I don't know who's behind this ultimately so I figured if I make enough copies at least one will go to someone sympathetic with some reach who might be authentic chain Mutual's with someone who can help no you really haven't figured it out yet seriously she asked fern Sables sighed and removed her pack and took out a polished silver plate at the end we hear that loud bang a lot more clearly it's definitely a gunshot then Zane comes on the tape only to deliver another shock a different ending speech in Scenario at this moment we find ourselves at the end of the material uncovered so far there is just one more discovery to look over before we can try to go for a puzzle solve during the course of all this audio we experienced three versions of the mystery voice from Jeff's control booth after a careful study with the discord group we isolated the moments and figured out what was being said here are the audio samples wall ravers it looks like we're just gonna have to leave it there this is an emergency I could do this all day I really could all right now let's try it out in shorthand without any extra sounds can you catch the differences by the endlessly rolling eyeballs of Morpheus the Morpheus of the fluttering eyelids by the endlessly rolling eyeballs of Orpheus the Orpheus of a fluttering eyelids by the amnesty rolling eyeballs of mobius the möbius of the fluttering eyelids Morpheus Orpheus and Mattias but what does it mean Morpheus is the Greek god of sleep and dreams and could definitely be depicted as an overseer of endlessly rolling eyeballs and fluttering eyelids both of these symptoms indicate REM sleep known as the dream state Orpheus was another ancient Greek figure not a god but a prolific poet musician and prophet Mobius is most often associated with the idea of the mobius strip named after mathematician Auguste Ferdinand Mobius a mobius strip is a sort of logical anomaly a figure with only one side that appears to have two and runs in a loop if we had a physical model of a mobius strip on hands we would be inclined to think it has two sides you can place your hand on it and put a finger on both sides when really in this form the opposite side is the same side further down the track a mobius strip flies in the face of what we understand with logic but it somehow works now let's think about what happens when we hear the talk of Morpheus Orpheus and Mobius we're about to hear Jays mixtape right do you remember what the ravers told us about the mixtape okay so her carplay cassettes and there was one mixtape she played constantly it was awesome but it's like hard to explain it's like I know that makes take my heart but not which song comes first and which learns last because it was like it was always in the stereo and just like well you know what cassettes are like right explain them for us okay so it's got two sides and it just like flipped itself over whenever one side was done and you would just pick up wherever it left off when you turn the car off last and it was like anna was like we were always continuing this one big road trip it had no beginning or end I remembered that mix actually really it was it was the only consent that she had I think and that car didn't die until halfway through our sophomore year we actually have ethics where from that tape is it cued up Jays mixtape is a mobius strip it has no beginning or end even though it has two sides and as soon as you pick up where you left off it just keeps going as if there is no other side to flip to a two-sided object that runs continuously without interference turning both sides into one eternal run a mobius strip now ask yourself what have we been listening to reverse transmission on the entire time this story played that's right it's a cassette tape over and over again we've heard the sounds at the center of this cassette tape is a mobius strip cassette tape in the tape we've been listening to like Jays mixtape is an impossible stack of layers running into each other here's what the raver said about the feeling of the tape to get us ready when it was finally the control bears Wow I'm actually not sure where you're gonna be starting it from but basically what I want to say is mmm you can't really get into it from just one piece of one song so you have to imagine hearing all these songs together like not knowing any of their names but knowing them all by heart all right throughout the course of reverse transmission we experienced the impossible on several layers fiction bleeds across boundaries so hard between story and world building the characters report on each other and provide analysis as if reality has become TV characters who died like dunning-kruger are brought on to newscasts that discuss their faint future events like Jays rescue are shown off as a junk television well before Jay needs rescuing and that falls in line with a setup of Detective 7 story as a cop show Demond 7 and his outside-the-box thinking leads to Jay's rescue in the real world which then becomes TV speaking of detective 7 there's a moment way back we listened to then I said to remember here's where it returns think about the mobius strip and listen closely but what I'm saying is we need to look at them under all kinds of distortion because that's the only way to see an anamorphic image oh I get it I want to see these photographs of Veerle degraded I want you to simulate various atmospheric conditions but an anamorphic image is a spatial distortion and what is the other side of space-time time you're going to send these photographs 200 years into the future and we are going to see what happens ok got it what is an anamorphic image it's an optical illusion like a mobius strip that only makes sense when you look at it from a particular angle it is defined as a default image that appears in its true shape when viewed in some unconventional way now for the final nail in this coffin let's bring up one last piece of evidence Jay sculpture do you remember what Sandra had to say about it and Jays conversation with car immediately after so she comes over and she's like whoa J this is like really good yeah yeah it's nuts I barely know how to look at it so did you teach her what did you teach her how to look at it no that's not what she meant Oh anyway J sculpture is weird a collage of found objects lumped together into one cohesive piece a 3d object submitted as art and it might only make sense if you figure out how to look at it Jay's mixtape and J sculpture are the keys to reverse transmission their metaphors and the name drops for Morpheus and Orpheus are hints while mobius is the first trailhead it's all pretty dreamlike isn't it this whole crazy art project that's not to say it is a dream but we have to think with a touch of dream logic and put ourselves in the role of a poet an artist and an unconventional thinker like detector seven I took back what I said at the very beginning I'm not sure if there really is much more digging around to do in the sandbox detective seven saves the day not by following sheer evidence turning up every stone and analyzing every bit of forensic data following every lead he follows the really weird and esoteric stuff bouncing back and forth between the goal posts that pop up he uses intuition and an anamorphic sense of thinking that's how he rescues Jay the goal for him was never to find every document factor clue it was to discover the big picture even if it involved a lot of off-the-wall thinking and activity our goal was the same we don't know what dunning-kruger was trying to make we don't know if Jay was actually a pulse wave agent the whole time we don't know how all these layers of reality could collide like this we don't even know what really happened to Zander with that one guy she dated was up - what happened to Zane and Gilly with the whole thing with the adorne Gilley was chances are it's all world-building and extra noise not the object of the game separate the signal from the noise right that's what Detective seven set to do gathering up all this material hunting for more clues trying to figure out what they don't Island password is for it just be making more noise when we're meant to catch on to the signal and what is that signal a mobius strip js impossible mixtape the found objects sculpture it's not all a dream but it sure is in the realm of ideas like black sky thinking in that my friends is the best I can do reverse transmission has been out for a while and I've worked with the WAM City discord group to uncover what was left of this for countless hours sun several different days to be honest there may very well be more I'm sure in some way we have missed things but for the moment this is how I can call it you took a ride on the mobius strip written by param anand Singh directed by petal Bryan and filled with voice talents who clearly had a lot of fun with what they were doing including of course a surprise silent cameo by cricket Arison as the face of Kathryn Pegasus that's all for now everyone thanks to all of you for viewing and major thanks as
