hey there fellow aqua files I improve it and this is Jim Davis and in an effort to curry favor with our Aquaman fans we will discuss now more no more and instead go back to that first lesson we learned from our first case of crabs under the sea darling it's better down where it's wetter take it from the Tritons we're discussing them on web DM this episode is brought to you by nerd our keys out of the box encounters live on Kickstarter the nerd artists were some of the first youtubers to reach out in contact us and we got started we've played D&D with them and they know what makes for a fun RPG session out of the box encounters has all kinds of options for integrating the encounters into your campaign and giving you all the information you need to anticipate your players questions go check them out link here and in the description and stay nerdy ok Jim let us plunge the depths of the oceans embrace the deep cold and as it embraces us we can't escape you can't escape I mean you get a swim speed but Triton's perhaps it's research or fortuitous or whatever but we did watch Aquaman recently we did watch Aquaman recently and I loved it insane exposition at every turn but the epic action adventure that happens underwater that's pretty tasty inspirational right I started thinking about this and not just Triton's in general but on a big tangent for a minute yeah I read a lot of Keith Baker's blog ever on creator he has a blog Larry talks about all the different DD subjects and stuff and one of them was a digression on the undersea empires of ever on and how cool Toa and Sagwa NAND and Triton and merfolk all have these like worlds spanning undersea empires one of the things that he always wanted to do is like write a book or some kind of supplement that was it takes place entirely underneath the waves and like details the you know how these various empires and countries have clashed and have their own history and everything and like the only other setting that I have seen it takes undersea civilizations as seriously as like this is a thing that exists in the world that influences the creatures honor the cultures on land and vice for whatever is the wilder lands of high fantasy setting which has Triton's and merfolk in it and one of the cities there the viridis stan the city state of the world upper I think is like the world Emperor there has subjugated the Tritons of Dolphin Bay or whatever it is and like keeps their emissaries locked in tanks in his throne room that he's sort of like as trophies of conquest and goes around and knocks on the glass every day I like it because it is you know we focus so much on the surface right the you know there's either you know what's going on on the human kingdoms and the elven realms and the dwarf holds and the like and maybe you venture underground into the subterranean world of the Underdark but so rarely do you go underneath the waves and realize that there is a whole fantasy world down here too they've got you know threats and monsters and civilizations and magic and why wouldn't they also trade with the surface why wouldn't they also talk and and communicate and be integrated it seems to me that some smart wizards would do some dealings with those that could get access to sweet sweet pearls sweet sweet pearls and all those special ingredients that are underwater and you know like what kind of spells can you cast with minerals from an undersea volcanic vent kind of fireball would you cast from underwater it like a back like a little bee like it's some kind of weird manta ray guano or yeah you're like powdered coral or something like that yeah I think probably like it's a fireball that just like flash boils water and creates like this maybe an obscures vision for a minute as it like creates a bunch of bubbles and and it like but it like flash boils the whole thing is called a little less damaged and like for another like round or two it's almost like a fog cloud yeah yeah something like that is they all sort of dissipate anything frightens would be one of those people I the wave wave hard-hard segue there sometimes you gotta have the undertow rip you right back the Riptide yeah back on the track Triton's would obviously be a part of this world I like this sort of the backstory of the Tritons is as from the elemental plane of water and it to me it like reminds me of the city ABBA lists who originated from the plane of water and at least in terms of like the Tritons backstory and folow is it suggests that there's a whole host of aquatic monsters that came to the prime material from the plane of water so they're like invasive species into these prime worlds and like the Tritons follow them they're you know they feel like some sort of responsibility for this is because they were the guardians of it or something I'm I don't even know if this is how this relates to like other DD lore for Triton's but it's it's an interesting kind of take because it it suggests number one that you're the oceans of your world are just as dangerous just as fantastical just as wondrous as the other places of it but also that somewhere down there are portals to the elemental planes that things can get through it's only by these beings these people who have decided that this is their responsibility that whatever comes through those portals doesn't take over the world that just is cool to me yeah I just I love that this is silent war under the waves to keep the world safe it's very Doctor Strange like like defending us from some existential threat whether it's space but in this case like the water the plane of water but love the idea of these civilizations kind of springing up around these portals that maybe brought their ancestors here yeah and I find oh we're in a new land yeah and we could go back but you know we found some bounty we found some purpose here and oh our enemies are coming through now yeah so yeah we got to put a cap on this thing and guard it it works for like sort of a baseline trident and if you're playing one that's just you know emissary of their of their people or like so we just like wandered up on land and it's like well what's this world all about or something like that you can lean into that we're the silent protectors and an archetype but I also think Triton's work well is just like a reskin just daring aquatic excuse me an aquatic humanoid you know they can be re skinned and in a variety of different ways to get mutant fish people or you know it costs maybe they are the result of like magical evolution or something like that humans that you know changed themselves permanently in order to be able to operate better under the water you could see something like you know returning to ever on someone from like the laser principalities I know in Forgotten Realms there's those islands off the Sword Coast where the the people they're sort of worship a Kraken it's like basically shadows over Innsmouth they you know they all become deep ones as they get older the aquatic heritage of their ancestors becomes more and more apparent and yeah maybe that could be represented by Triton I like them for that reason the ocean is a terrible and wondrous place and it's full of bizarre weird alien creatures and that's just like our own oceans they inspire and have so much going on in them that it seems like a shame to not develop them for your own world and like find a place for Triton they're champions yes they're there they're Nobles they're gonna live got an elf vibe yeah they do have like that kind of like better than a little bit that haughtiness to them we have this I wouldn't say divine purpose but we have this purpose of protection and whatever and generally they're kind of ignorant of the surface so taking all that kind of into account what are some good concepts I mean like I can tell you one that I have yeah because I literally made it last night for your upcoming underwater game yes I do have I am prepping for an underwater but after watching Aquaman I'm like come on I got to do a noble I'm gonna do a warlock hex blade sure and we get one on common item so I'm taking that trident a fish command baby that's my hex blade that's the thing that is call it has called to me and so I can't wait to play because you know just the stat boosts alone it's it really it's right there for a warlock it's there for a lot of a lot of classes I like them as paladin's right like I think they fit Palin's really well you could do devotion you could do ancients yeah you know that angels definitely I could even see you know depending on how you structure their you know their society and how advanced your you know undersea civilizations are they could be like oh that crowns like that or if they're how aggressive they are like a certain king they could be oath of conquest I mean if they believe that the ocean should rule I mean there is that as well right like they've got that the arrogance and sort of haughtiness can be translated into you know well yeah we don't know anything about the surface world like why would we need to you know like it's just gonna get swallowed up one day I know enough it doesn't have enough water you can't see that right like if you're a especially if you don't have buy-in to the plane or origins for them and they are sort of like a and indigenous aquatic people to your world then they may see themselves as the first intelligent peoples because all life comes from the sea they are some of the first ones to develop civilization like screw those dragons and elves like you guys needed gods to do that right like you had to have gods come down and help you out we did this ourselves we scraped ourselves out of the muck of the Seas and formed ourselves so you could feel like that and in that sense you know they would have kind of a you know the rest of the world belongs to us because it's we are the first sort of attitude about the surface or even other undersea people's good paladin's they're Morlocks as well storm sorcerers Oh like the storms oh yeah no it'd be nice and tasty but even if you're just a fighter yeah you're a fighter that leads I mean you you know you're gonna have at least a little little bump to charisma it works so well anytime you can get con and a physical another physical stat and a mentals fat I mean like anything that gets three bumps just like that yeah I like the three plus ones and I think that it'd be it'd be interesting to see more of the player race options to go that route I really kind of see it for hobgoblins you know like hobgoblins have that weird sort of like con int but you could easily do strength con and you know and and just plus one each of those so I like that again the rest of their abilities kind of like tie in to make a character that has a strong theme and is also like you might not think about it you might not you might think like the ability to operate independently underwater and have all these ability these aquatic abilities like it's not gonna matter it's not gonna come up and yet almost every time that I have included a water hazard in a dungeon in an environment or something where it's like you've got to go underwater you've got to navigate say an underground river or there's a subterranean Lake or you got across this body of water for something like it's always a challenge it's always one of those things where players are like aw  like no I don't know I don't have the water breathing ritual never use it the vigilante game that I was in near the beginning when we were still like 5th 4th 5th 6th level around that time there was a big part that was all underwater we were fighting so Hoglund there was a little some Triton's in there but there were some dire sharks that we had to fight but luckily we did have a druid yeah that could cast water breathing but of course they had sorcerers and sometimes in the middle of fights and things at least there was a couple times we had underwater things and at one point it was like yeah they're casting the spell on our water breath and you know like you really have to think about these things and think them through it adds a fun challenge to me but yeah if you don't have to worry about that but you don't have to worry about it and I consider being able to operate independently underwater to be one of those benchmarks of an adventurer that by the time there get to say tier 3 or whatever - 2 or 3 where I kind of expect yeah you guys are adventurers you need to have some recourse even if it is magic and can be taken away from you so like having a creature it's like I got a swim speed I'm amphibious plus I can talk I can communicate you know sort of rudimentary ideas to the life that we're gonna find down here and I can go anywhere down here it doesn't matter how cold it is doesn't matter how deep it is I'm gonna be fine and in that sense you've got a more versatile character who is competent in a variety of environments and that appeals to me strongly and in that sense I'll take that for almost any character concept you know whether it's a totem barbarian where it's like I'm a shark totem Triton you know and I just reskin say the wolf abilities or something like that I'm a whale totem Triton and that's where the bear comes from or even just make up others you know octopus you know totem barbarian get a grappling maybe that's that your two weapon the fighter barbarian or pretty grappling some giant squid Kraken crackin totem or it's like a ranger ride beast companion Ranger Sonoran with the dolphin ya dolphin shark Orca or octopus or any other number of weird creatures that you might want to have the more I talk about it the more I want to have an entire campaign that takes place underwater just because these are I'll do a rundown for you guys kouha TOA merfolk maro SOG one la casa which are another kind of sea devil type monster for prior editions triton seals and some types of lizard folk you'd easily see like sea iguanas or something like that it's being part of this world and like that is as even a auntie-ji you can have like more like water moccasin you know yeah all you have to do you know amphibious as a trait and that's it he's a swim speed it's so easy to do those are is many options nearly as on the surface that are available to you obviously not all the books but you know it's that is a good array of options you have all different kinds of archetypes involved you can have vast undersea kingdoms and explorations and coral dungeons expeditions to deep trenches to find you know lost ships that have been wrecked and recover things from the surface or you know traveling to other aquatic planes to treat with the people that live there or to banish you know some sort of aquatic horror back to where it came from you can do all kinds of things nearly everything that you can do on the surface you can do underneath the waves but it's it's got that added alienness to it it's got the fact what I love about like the ocean is that it's all connected you step into it and you're immediately connected through the water to just about anywhere else and it's not like say the land where there's you know you're bound to the surface right it's terrestrial whereas under water you're swimming it's it's three-dimensional the the places that you can visit the things that you can do are more expansive in that since it like really inspires me to do something new and interesting and different with these creatures as opposed to just like tacking them on to a setting and being like oh yeah there's a whole civilization underwater people out there and then like you never talk about it it does not really matter what you pick right you're probably gonna be just fine probably just fine you can imagine them being friends with like save water Ganassi and the two of them or even just like Triton's are another type of elemental humanoid you know they're they just are and maybe they're more water than then you know flesh or maybe they are more like fish people and may you give them like full-on gills and you know bug eyes and fins and they look way more or like deep ones or something than they do yeah look closer to Suhag one right yeah thank you man those are the ways I'd be the reskin they're sort of use them conceptually but yeah like I said more I talked about the more I want to just write this up yeah most definitely well in order to prep you're gonna have to know all of their abilities yes so let's start running down we already mentioned it but like getting that plus one to strength con and charisma I mean that's just a it's a good array abilities I mean did health might and appeal I mean that's you know you're ready for the cover of a magazine Fabio he was a trident I like the stat distribution their swim speed amphibious obviously required for creatures are gonna operate underwater but it's the like controlling air and water ability like sort of like their innate magic about it that to me says they maybe are partially elemental themselves obviously complains you know right off the bat being able to cast fog cloud once a day third level you get Gus to win once a day and then wall of water at fifth level yeah now question Jim yeah and this is purely it has nothing to do with the character that I've made but fog cloud and gust of wind are those just above water abilities or work or do you use those can you use those under the sea I mean I would say by their definition fog clouds probably not gonna be useful under the sea because fog is just like what vaporized water you know I mean like it's it's you know but you could say they're math abilities mastery of air and water control of air and water so fog cloud might be just a you summon like millions of tiny bubbles around you that obscure sight and you just can they just keep generating them and they dissipate or float to the surface but in that localized area it sort of creates this you know confusing whatever I you know you can see this in our own world like dolphins that round up fish my likes either flapping their tails to sort of create a lot of bubbles and confusion or like disturbing the bottom of the sea floor to kind of create limited visibility and trap fish it could also be like ink cloud where you see if it's like a squirt of just sort of ink that you know that fills the water and sort of obscures things for the minute or it could even just be like you stirring up the dust of the the seafloor of the seafloor and bringing it up to wherever it is that you are at same stats wouldn't change anything about it but you will it allow it definitely allow it yeah it would it's not gonna be a cloud of fog it's gonna be something else in gust of wind what about that a gust of wind is the same thing it can either be like you're summoning a bunch of air under water and it's and it forces the water out of the way and and creates the same kind of situation like just like a G out of water it could be just like a jet of water where it's not even air at all and you just like are shooting out a stream of water like Oh like a pool or something all right that's all I need to know I'm out I'll see you next Sunday I mean this is the way it is with like all kinds of spells I mean just like briefly digress on that in that spells will obviously operate differently underwater especially those that summon energies that are incompatible with being submerged and thinking specifically of like say fire and lightning but you know perhaps it's one of those things where like thunder damage is increased underwater because sound travels better through water than it does say air or fire doesn't create the fire smells don't create fire they create hyper boiled water cavitate the water yeah or it like flash regular flash boils it so much that it just creates a localized pocket of steam that that skalds you and then the superheated water around it rushes in to fill that vacuum and that's what's well yeah well see to me technically though that would be like thunder damage because that's what the mantis shrimp does this little it can it creates sonic boobs with its little claws that just not that stuns and knocks things out use your common sense in Prior Edition something like a lightning bolt turned from like a a you know bolt of lightning that you shoot to a an AoE fireball that does electricity and you take the damage like centered on you you're touching the water do you touch from the water too unless you know but if you're saying a vocre and can sculpt spells then maybe you can still control that kind of energy and not you know get yourself caught up in all of it even if you change the way that those damage types work underwater now honestly on this one it's common sense and the fact that the Dean these spells already give you everything you need to know to reskin them they tell you what saves to use they give you the parameters and spell it and that's up to you as the DM or player to be like this is what it looks like underwater or where this is like the specific version that might character casts because they're from an underwater people I cast Thunder ball I'm not gonna sing this song I promise moving on to emissary of the seat yeah oh you can't you know talk to fish nah you've gotta talk to them you can talk to me the same way that like a forest gnome can talk to critters you know and and I think it's this is one of those where I will play this one probably is more powerful than it is and you know for one what is a fish No why wouldn't be talking of fish I'd probably talk about dolphins and octopi and those under the seat no the smarter truth yeah I'm not gonna talk to little Guppies and minnows and things like that come on come was there a big boom lately that's about all this was there a loud noise that's about it thanks Nemo your parents are over there the emissary of the sea ability I probably would play up as more powerful than it is as a ribbon ability the ability to talk to just sort of animals and the like is not gonna break your game particularly if you're cognizant of sort of like which animals are intelligent which animals are maybe beyond intelligent and actually sort of like willing to converse and able to they're not just dumb animals they're sit around wait for some way that it will actually talk to its role playing opportunity anytime there's a chance to facilitate communication in the game world right whether it's a character knowing a language a character you know having an audience with an NPC that they'd like to talk to I would rather lean on the side of giving them too much information having the avenues of communication be too open then too restrictive and so I'd rather say like yeah you can just talk to aquatic creatures down here because that leaves the door open for me to like pass on information that the party might need to know in an organic manner that doesn't feel forced it's a way to like learn more about the setting if the player wants to and you know it's an option available to them and if it's more expansive then it's more likely to be used move it on to kind of their last ability here guardians of the depths which I think this completely makes sense I mean having cold resistance it's cold down there and the rigors of deep water the pressure and everything don't get to them which you know it also accounts for their +1 strengths you know what I mean and and their Constitution it's and the like I like how these like to me all of these abilities really feel tied to their environment like this is exactly how they would evolve acknowledging all of that what effects like bringing one of these characters to the surface of like yeah you're far inland you're not anywhere near the water now hopefully you know do whatever Ghost of saltmarsh whenever it is out will give you an opportunity to play something like this if you haven't but you're playing like say a traditional game of Dungeons and Dragons and it doesn't feature water features that much like what do you how does your Triton get on land yeah they do a running about well I hate to keep going back to it since we just watched it but I mean not every place used to be land right in your world some places might have y'all used to be at one point there's a sea there whether it's their questing for an object of power or an ancestral homeland or a family heirloom like oh my ancestors are from these mountains back you know a thousand years ago when this was an ocean and I have to recover their signet ring maybe we're given something in a will and it requires the signet ring to unlock the box but it's like oh yeah by the way it's a great grandma back in the mountains yeah it's over there this is where I would probably do a Triton far traveler as a background like you are you are a long way from home and your background is the way that like people are gonna look at you and your if you're doing the kind of greenish or blueish tinted skin you know whether you have gills or not you get dry out if you're outside it's like he's got a go jump in the river every couple days I'm sorry I would play that up like I'm more comfortable in the water it's always always taking baths always taking baths if there's a river we get to a town first thing I'm doing checking in jumping in the river but play those things up like that I mean you know your your fish out of water but you don't need to stay in the water I like that idea especially the far traveler because far traveler has those interesting features that kind of like reinforces the the other worldliness of certain people's thinking like gives you that opportunity to play an emissary or something like that along those lines I might do like lower bard and combine it with either sage or the anthropologist background from two of 9/8 late to momen I elation and now the Triton is more of a Marco Polo figure or an explorer type and they've got some magic so they can you know use and I'd probably go lean really heavily into the water spells for that and mostly though they are there to to fix the ignorance that Triton Society has about the surface world and so they are there as like yeah I'm here to learn as much as I can I'm I'm part of say maybe I'm part of an official diplomatic mission you know or maybe I'm just on my own you know it's your job to like introduce yourselves to the various courts of the land what do they know what do they know about us are they friendly would they be willing to trade are they is there a place for us on the surface is there a place for them underneath the waves that might be in the character that I play and you're sort of like there as a goodwill ambassador to this newly discovered people's yeah or something like that see I can see I can see it that way or you play it that way externally but you are the first Scout in the coming conquest you go up there find out as much as you can about them yeah see if they'd be willing to you know that's like the sinister secret in your background is you're just like a cat's paw and and it's like okay they picked you because you're naive and trusting and have a curiosity about the world and what's above it people back home know they're not interested in any of the things they say they are they are interested in something else actually and that's even more interesting here the secret cats ball and so through adventuring somebody feel like actually there it looks like they're forming for war and you're with them then you get to have the you against your own people thing what I love the most is the conceptual ground that they open up and and the fact that underwater adventures and underwater fantasy locations are pardon the pun you know unexplored depths of of gaming and you know for this crusty old barnacle gamer like myself it's the new and novel that really draws to me yes let the oceans scrub away all of the rough surfaces like the stone just like the stone let the ocean envelop you every crevice every fold the warm envelope embrace of the ocean mm-hmm so erotic so erotic and so wet if you some great stuff to link here and in the description okay are we done now
