it's time for me to live up to my family name which I just made up hey guys massacre X here it is Christmas Eve and I hope you're all doing well I'm all ready for some holiday what if hurry it's been a spate of good boy vibes on the massacre x channel as it is one of those merry times of year and a good way to round out not only the year of 2019 but the decade by how far we've come but not as far as the subject of today's what if despite the noble and quite refined air that we get from this character he was not a good boy not at all but we've managed to sort that one out using the common trope of reverting the allegiance of a character onto the side that is not only seen to be good but also what are the more marketable sides you can make a lot of money out of it and you know that to be true really we've sought to seek a different tale using a slightly different means of going about things from normal so we are asking you today on the eve before Christmas what might have happened itself turned good if you're new to this series then we must point out but the cell that we're talking about here is that the exact same perfect cell that we see in the story that tale had been told and he was beyond the phase of redemption since he had a lot of freezer to tone down and yes I know we have just done a story about freezer turning good but that took a very wild spin on things and getting all formatic there if you haven't watched it go and check it out by the way but this cell that we're alluding to is the one that was given the chance to grow from the statement was in in the sub lab of doctors euro from their bomber took it in and gave it the chance to gestate and then become its own bug man who loved hugs and became a firm friend of trunks and goten and then later the majority of the dragon team it took a while certainly but he was able to do it this is all control of your is net experience thank you in the last part our good boys SEL whom we refer to as Android 21 not related to the actual 21 was left with a pretty hard parenting conundrum in previous chapters we found out that he had become a little broody and wish to have offspring of his own and he has then made a father with his own two children mightor and Kandra for a while all was well but things start to get a little complicated when the truth about his origins becomes apparent that it wasn't explained properly or indeed at all Marta and contra were asking about perfect self and truth be told our good boy 21 doesn't know too much about his own facts of life when he really should the only thing that he can recall being told himself was the fact that that perfect I was an evildoer designed to absorb his siblings and that go on and defeated him but allowed Hercule to take credit for it and the monsters defeat and everything else essentially he was explained away as any other typical baby within the dragon team however this turned out to be somewhat of a foolish decision in the long run to gloss over their past like that was becoming clear to 21 in this family that that's no good they have no idea of their ancestry and that is the subject of today's pot in reality 21 was unable to answer his children's request simply dismissing it as not really worth their time right now there are more important matters at hand which concerned the safety of the world but its offspring word that naive mightor and confer looked to each other and don't look impressed they've heard that excuse so many times before and it's clear that they aren't going to get a straight answer any time soon it's not like their father doesn't want to though it's just that he can't in good faith before he can approach his children with a suitable answer for their very valid question 21 decides to confide with someone that to his knowledge at least knows a lot about this creature and that is the person who is just gatecrashed the past for the third time he wants to make use of the young man's time in their timeline to get some answers I mean it's not every day when the chance to find out more about your origins and your past just so happens to fall through a time warp or indeed any other day for that matter so while everyone else is occupied with the whole Goku black situation and what to do next in terms of countering the foe 21 is more absorbed pun not intended with his own mission he's busy trying to find a way to give their children a satisfying answer about their origins that won't scare them or make them feel ashamed of themselves for existing after all he could barely understand it himself he decides to approach trunks during one of the breaks he takes during his training with Goku Future Trunks is still trying to process the fact that a being that is practically identical to perfect cell is sitting down next to him right there looking curious and inquisitive he can sense that 21 is a little impatient and apologizes for the staring and the confused expression oh don't worry I've heard far worse than that in my time believe me he is of course alluding to the time so he had to struggle with the siblings as well as the constant mistrust from Vegeta on previous chapters 21 then deciced has dropped the small talk and get to what he needs to No he asks trunks how was his life since he left their timeline when he was just a little thing as the last time he had heard about him being in this year was right after the cell games the byproduct of his by-product although trunks was aware that today had spared the embryo whilst they were looking for information about the other androids when he was last here he had no idea about what had happened to it afterwards as you know he was keen to get back to his own timeline to count to 17 and 18 there he then admits to the cell lookalike that seeing him reaching his perfect form like the original still makes him feel a little uneasy but trucks tries to make his feelings not take over his better judgment 21 nods and thanks the time-traveller for his tolerance it's much quicker than he could have hoped trunks then shares the story of how in the rebuilt future he managed to take on de Bora and Barr body with shins help and how Earth's peace has been jeopardized again by the appearance of black I guess Tabora I know all too much about him I drank him one time wait what how did you do that it's what I do or at least did once 21 twins his thumbs as he shouldn't have been proud of drinking with someone 21 then not to change the subject and says that he can relate to exactly how Goku must feel right now knowing that there is an evildoer with his face just going about things he then thinks the time is right to proceed to ask trunks about cell directly but they are then interrupted by blacks untimely arrival feeling incredibly frustrated with the awful timing 21 immediately rushes towards Goku black demanding him to answer for his crimes and destruction of trunks his future also wanting to make clear to trunks that he is a good guy for realsies which is not something that black is expected your presence reminds me of something I recognize you somehow I don't know why but she posed a challenge for me once a challenge I wish to take up again 21 assumes that he's talking about the other cell but chooses not to get bogged down in matters one thing is for sure though our good boy is strong enough to give black a run for his money and a considerable deck in the schnoz with beerus realizing that this creature whatever it is is not Goku as the key is different hey bug man he says 21 turns around and looks surprised that beerus had dressed him directly in a way you are more Goku than that guy is you should take it as a compliment in an act of desperation black destroys trunks his time machine dissatisfied that he didn't get a chance to fight with Goku directly and instead had this weird impulse to fight this second-rate biological mess the feeling is mutual though but before 21 can seal the deal black gets sucked back into the future leaving 21 too much ran curse under his breath that he wanted to finish him off that's the same talking within him I'm sure of it we some beerus decide to investigate the time linked situation as it seems to be something worthy of their precious time and bomber then works on repairing the time machine that black destroyed for a future Sun meanwhile trunks decides to spend some time with Gohan and his family like he does in the original in order to regain some sense of where he is however he doesn't come across Gohan at first instead he meets piccolo taking care of Myka and Kandra who are in turn playing with pan they are still a bit afraid of trunks since he gave their father so much grief so they hide behind their grandfather piccolo but piccolo reassures them that trunks is not an enemy and point trunks towards Gohan the conversation that trunks has with the present counterpart of his mentor is pretty similar to what they had in the original story but he notes that Gohan has started training again sensing that his power has grown since they last met in truth he had dropped a lot in power but had now gotten all back again and seemingly then some Gohan attributes that chest not to the likes of the del piccolo and 21 trunks is happy to see Gohan playing with his daughter and attempts to say a proper hello to mightor on Kandra I heard a lot about you from your dad you seem pretty cool I didn't think there could be different kinds of offspring of cell with this they seemed less scared this time and it start to ask a lot of questions about time travel whilst Kandra mostly asks about trunks his adventures in the past Maitreya is very curious about the technical aspects of time travel itself King to figure out how it was possible I'm afraid you have to ask MA I mean Bulma about that I only know how to steer the thing and where to put the fuel like this eyes open wide and she is mesmerized by the idea of learning more they then get interrupted though by 21 who kindly asks his children to not take up trunks his time anymore as he needs to prepare to fight for the Future Trunks says that it's not a problem at all and thanks 21 for stepping up against black so quickly he really appreciated that quick thinking the kids then ask him about cell trunks looks at 21 who is still trying to keep his cool but the young man knows how this question must be pretty painful for him he then responds that he was indeed an evildoer but was nothing like them the kids and 21 have heard that part before though they start to roll their eyes but trunks really knows how to establish the difference here he compares cell to black who's only wearing Goku's face and that his look doesn't define what he is trunks assures them that none of them are like the monster he once faced and in at least two timelines now he is forever gone this makes contra idolized trunks as this amazing hero sort of like how kid trunks admires Papillon immediately after he says his goodbyes to the 21 family contra finds himself a stick which he starts to wield as a pretend sword meanwhile trunks goes to train with Vegeta and although 21 could technically defeat Goku black earlier he felt that the warrior was holding back somewhat and did not show his entire potential yet or at least he didn't get the chance to he decides to focus on his family and is tasked by Vegeta in staying within the past so he and Gohan could be Earth's defenders just in case black decides to attack again from behind meanwhile Goku visit Zeno and gets the reset button like in the original story but three sands then go to the future and things there go very much like they did in the original story as 21 is not involved having been tasked to defend present-day earth upon their return 21 can see that things went badly for them look at the friends who got beat up by black worries him a ton this isn't right how could black be so strong black wasn't that strong when they fought before he could have been holding back that large right also initially he scares future my a little bit Vegeta exclaims that they need additional help in order to stand a chance they are going to need 21 as a training partner as black is improving faster than they'd anticipated and the only person who has experience in fighting black properly is 21 Goku also knows that he is working with someone named sama soo a Supreme Kai 21 knots as he really wants to help trunks regain his future and show his children that they have potential to be heroes and that's where we're going to be leaving things for right now so what do you guys think how do you feel 21 could help in round 2 against Goku black will mightor and contra play some kind of role themselves leave a comment below and let's get this discussion going and I shall see you in the next video Merry Christmas and catch you later
