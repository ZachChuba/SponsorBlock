hello this is chef john from food wishes
DICOM with italian white bean and sausage stew that's right every once in
a while there comes along a soup that is so comforting so substantial and so
satisfying that it becomes known as a stew and
while it is true the rules and regulations for whether to name
something a stew or a soup are pretty casual and vague the point is this soup
as the old commercial goes eats like a meal so with that let's go ahead get
started and what we'll want to do the night before we're gonna make this is
soaked some dry cannellini beans overnight and a whole bunch of cold
fresh water and this is what mine look like the next morning and of course we
could make this with a couple cans of beans but this takes almost no effort
and not only do these come out better but they are way way way less expensive
to use which is nice when you're saving up to buy $15 face masks but anyway once
our beans are set we can move on to erasing the casing on some Italian
sausage and to do that all we have to do is make one cut down the center and then
we'll simply peel that casing off so I did that to all four and if need
someone to tell can use any sausage want I just did but a nice
sweet Italian sausage just containing lots of garlic and fennel is a great
choice and then what we'll do is go ahead and transfer those into a dry soup
pot that we've set over medium-high heat and we'll go ahead and brown that
sausage up well at the same time breaking it up into some nice small
pieces and of course exactly how small is gonna be up to but something that
fits comfortably on a spoon will be a pretty good approach and by using a dry
pan here some of those meat juices are gonna stick to and start caramelizing on
the bottom creating what we call in the business of Fond Fon D and that's going
to add some beautiful color to our stew and also an extra level of flavor but
anyway once our sausage has been broken up and we've started to form a decent
found on the bottom we'll go ahead and toss in some diced onion and we'll cook
that stirring for about five minutes or until the onions start to soften and
turn translucent and even though we haven't added any oil yet just enough
fashio to render two out of that sausage to coat and cook these onions
beautifully oh and if want can add some garlic here but my sausage was
pretty garlicky so I didn't but anyway like I said we'll cook those
onions for about five minutes and as we do that caramelize found at the bottom
of the pan is gonna get nicer and nicer and then what we'll do to release all
that goodness is once we think our onions have gone long enough is we'll go
ahead and splash in some white wine which is going to deglaze all that
caramelization off the bottom and if don't have wine around can just
dilute some wine vinegar with a little water and use that or if times are
really tough can just use a splash of water so we'll go ahead and stir in
that wine and we can also this time toss in some freshly ground black pepper a
nice big pinch of red chili flakes in one bay leaf which is pretty much
mandatory for any bean dish and at this point we will also add somewhere between
6 and 8 cups of water and the reason I say 6 to 8 is because that's gonna
depend on how thick want this and yes of course we can always adjust later
and add more and in case you're keeping score at home I added about seven and a
half but anyway we'll stir that in and then do two things we'll go ahead and
add our soaked beans which of course we've drained and we will also crank our
heat up to high because we want to bring this up to a boil
an acid starts to bubble you're gonna notice a foam come to the top which a
lot of people insist skim off and sometimes I do but I usually don't since
I'm pretty sure those are just proteins foaming up but one thing we do have to
do once it starts boiling is reduce our heat down to medium-low at which point
we'll simply simmer this for about an hour or so or until our beans are tender
and then what I like to do at about the 30 minute mark is go ahead and add our
salt and there's different schools of thought when it comes to salting beans
while they cook okay some people say don't do it until the end because they
believe it makes the beans tough whereas other people add it right at the
beginning and don't believe it makes a difference I think those other people
are crazy and then there's people like me who split the difference and add the
salt about halfway through which I've always found works out nicely and that's
it once my beans were salted I continued cooking down for another 30 minutes or
so or until my beans were perfectly tender and how I knew for sure is I gave
them a taste all right there's no guessing in the kitchen so make sure you
give them a try and if they are tender what I like to do at this point is take
a potato masher and smash about 20 to 25 percent of the
which is gonna give our students a little bit of a creamier texture okay so
that's optional but I do recommend it regardless of whether do that or not
once our beans are tender we will add the last major ingredient three or four
nice big handfuls of some chopped greens which in my case was some Dino kale but
Swiss chard would also work beautifully or something like mustard greens or even
some stinging nettles if can find him and what we'll do is stir those in
and raise our heat to medium and then simply cook this until our greens are
tender which for me was about 15 minutes or so and of course that's going to
depend on exactly which green used or if want was something tender like
spinach that's only gonna take a couple minutes so will have to figure that
out I mean are after all the mr.
Greenjeans of your sausage beans ingredients but you'll know because
you'll be tasting and checking along the way and at some point you'll say to
yourself know what these greens are tender and then once they are we only
have one thing left to do and that is make sure we taste this and see if it
has enough salt which it almost never does and if it needs more of course we
will adjust and that's it once we're happy with how it's looking tasting and
feeling we'll go ahead and find an appropriately-sized in shape bowl and we
will serve that up piping hot oh and one major thing that's missing in the shot a
big old hunk of crusty Italian bread all right preferably that baked yourself
that really does complete this whole experience and then to finish this I
like to drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil which is optional but also
mandatory and I would say the same thing about a little grating of
parmigiano-reggiano or mad K's pecorino and then last but not least a few more
chili flakes just to stay in shape and that's it or our telling white bean and
sausage soup which is so good we're calling a stew is done so let me go
ahead and grab a spoon and stir in that cheese and then dig in and that my
friends is just one of the greatest and most delicious ways to eat beans ever
invented okay this is the kind of food that warms from the inside out and
while it's very rich and satisfying and borderline decadent and certainly not
low-calorie it is also incredibly nutritious and I think safe to say very
good for both physically and mentally
whoops sorry hold on I gotta clean this drip
I have this thing about drips on the rim of a bowl which I can't explain but it's
pretty serious but anyway to summarize just a
magnificent bowl of food my only complaint was something I mentioned
earlier okay while my right hand was extremely happy spooning this stuff into
my face my left hand was like why am I not holding a piece of bread who do I
talk to about this but whether you're dunking bread Nisour not I really do
hope give this a try soon so please follow the links below for the
ingredient amounts a principle written recipe and much more info as usual and
as always
