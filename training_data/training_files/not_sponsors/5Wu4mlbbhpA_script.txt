[3,570,000 views] [Thank youㅜㅜ] So many Yongwangnims really liked it! So, we were like, 'let's hurry and do a part 2!' And we talked a lot about it. (Idea donor) Cosmic Sound oppa Gave us a good idea. To try a CM song medley. So we came to you with a part 2. Recording this... - There were a lot of things that happened...
- That's right. While recording I was really like, ugh- [Struggling out of shame.mp4] But, oppa was like, 'You may be like that... But Yongddonie is probably going to do it well.' Sure enough You were like this, too!
[Struggling out of shame.Yongddon] Really, being like, 'Hands are reaching
for them' [Soul-kkang] [Thrilling just thinking about it] (Song request) Youndoo. Do Youndoo~ (Thrilling) Trying to do it like, R&B.. [So thrilling] But we really did work hard preparing it, so I hope you guys enjoy it. If the response is explosive.. Then??? You know, right? We will come back with a part 3. Yes!
