do exactly what I do and these could turn out to be the best tacos you will ever have in your life we've made carne asada we've not made them into tacos I'm telling you this is the thing you want and I might add that my carne asada recipe maybe the most controversial thing I've ever made [Music] ridiculous it's ridiculous its carne asada whoo it takes exception to this well vegans I suppose but those aren't the people giving me [ __ ] the people giving me [ __ ] are people that say no no Sam there should never be soy sauce in carne asada I don't know I didn't grow up making carne asada I only know what makes it freakin delicious and this helps make it freakin delicious as does the brown sugar that I don't know is common in it stick or carne asada first avocado crema second cooking third eating fourth and then we're out we start with chopped up cilantro and by the way this recipes on my website cooking Gator comm will put a link below so you don't have to write anything down if you don't want to we follow that up with a tablespoon of cumin love cumin learn to love cumin if you hate it next couple tablespoons of brown sugar and light brown sugar not the super dark one about a teaspoon of kosher salt and pepper then we want the zest of one lime we can put a link to the zester zester's a really great thing I say it all the time any kind of citrus you want to do beautiful little bits of chocolate on top of a dessert on top of whipping cream this is your pal well Parmesan cheese grated over top of some pasta this is your pal and then we want the juice of that line roll it a bit to break up the fibers inside make a juicier when you squeeze it a couple tablespoons of the previously aforementioned soy sauce go with about a half a cup of avocado oil and of course chosen and this will mix you could smell what I'm smelling right now you know why this is gonna be amazing and then we'll go in our skirt steak which is what we're using today we want the whole guy covered beautifully like this like this getting really good I like all of this to go into a ziploc bag mistake gorgeous marinade try and get all of it seal it up and you're done this now is gold for you so treat it specially what I mean is just put it in the fridge give it an hour give it four hours if you can we'd probably be great right now but we want to give it a little bit more time overnight overnight fine no big deal don't need to four hours make it in the morning come home have it that night make it at lunch come home have it that night if you make it at lunch you come home you're already at home so forget it just make it that's the important part the evening of the evening of July 3rd you could make it and then have it July 4th what why doing this to me ok that's done and it's resting of course if it's gonna be for a few hours throw it in the refrigerator that's the proper thing to do we will make the avocado crema now and then we just throw a bunch at well just here watch this first thing into our blender is an avocado and I just cut this I haven't looked yet I fancy myself a pretty good avocado picker shall we the spin and oh the avocado board should hire me to give how to choose an avocado lesson look at that so the whole thing goes in just take my spoon break it up a bit this way this video was not brought to you by the National avocado board it was not while this video was definitely not sponsored by any avocado board anywhere years ago I did a baccardo video training video not training even years ago I did an avocado video on how to choose proper avocados I don't remember which board it was but they closed down they took over a grocery store at one night from like 11:00 to 3:00 to make a video with fighting off some innate ability to pick all picados when you went to the car university no I know what I'm saying is I am ilucato University I don't have another one I would show you you want to apply gentle pressure not using the tips of your fingers but the pads of your fingertips to see if the avocado yields gently when you put apply little pressure that's all it is it's science really and I'm a [ __ ] genius when it comes to off of cars so just put your beautifully ripe avocado into your thing processor blender bullet whatever you want to use to our avocado we will add about a quarter cup of nonfat Greek yogurt max could that be sour cream yeah no couldn't yes yes yes of course it could just be adding unnecessary fat max and then we follow in with more cilantro clove of garlic we will smash pull off the paper and just take this whole guy and drop him in this will also get the juice of a lime same thing we'll roll them again cut squeeze both sides in little salt and pepper of course and you know we do now max thank you slap on we do we mix we put the base on I have milk at the ready if this doesn't get thin enough oh my god no I mean milk yep everybody go two tablespoons of milk let's go back on I probably should have done that but I do like to try it by itself sometimes [Music] look so I like it a little thinner but I'm not gonna do that this is gonna be fine this would be going in the bottom of our tortillas so let's have a little taste I'm sorry it's just freaking heavenly that by itself on a tortilla incredible that with the carne asada and the tomato and onion we're about to cut up out of this world out of this world this is simple we cut up some white onion fairly small and put it in a bowl with some finely cut up tomato and I don't want this to be mushy so I'm only using really the outside and not using the wet seeded interior if I was a tomato I would not want to be the wet interior it's for [ __ ] sure and I've got a little cilantro left I'll give this just a quick little chop up for some color that will go in I'll add a little salt and pepper a tiny splash of avocado oil and we will mix and this beautiful little mixture will go on top of our tacos when they're ready okay I'm gonna get the carne my grill is hot and on we go could I be more dramatic and on we go on we go oh we go don't I don't need you to make it any more dramatic than my stupidity already does [Music] I just looked down to get ready to get the carne asada and I found three cloves of garlic sitting in front of me which tells me I didn't put garlic in the carne asada so here they are so put them in because fortunately I made one in advance because even though you would have known the difference if I'd made a batch of carne asada and then put it off to the side and said oh now four hours later that would have killed me inside so I made it in advance so it had at least an hour and a half or so of marinating I'm gonna have to add this to the other batch still we're throwing this on the grill cuz it's ready I don't want to eat and I got to leave I got stuff to do I can't stay here all day long looking at Max and chance in the slept bar I mean I want to you want to do it my Scheider's right now yeah you want to see what I look at here's what I'm looking at a little sweeping motion for you first interview will be the [ __ ] bong little wave slip on this is my view ladies and gentlemen there he is max little wave there's Chauncey we all good good let's go and on we go is that gorgeous or what yeah baby and what I'd really love about the skirts day is it doesn't take long to cook it's thin look at the color already I just do that for Max's benefit when there's flames on the grill Max is very excited and I mean that in every sense of the word weird that was weird yeah I don't know why no I said that honestly I could eat this with just a little color on it [Music] so gorgeous that marinade was going on top Wow a little too much flame slow down now go there the heat is insane from here oh I can't wait let me give this side a little more of the marinade and this is why we grill folks we grill because the oil the fat the grease drips down the flames come up you get that gorgeous charred effect the flavors the taste the texture everything and this is going to be very close to being ready this thin part is done so I'm just gonna fold it over let this thicker bottom finish and then it's coming off oh man this is gonna taste ridiculous let's see and so here's what we've got and it's beautiful and a learning point I always say cut against the grain the Canadian against how do you say it against against it's not spelled against it's spelled against cut against the grain and if you have a good look the grain goes like this so what you could do of course is just make super long cuts this way but I don't think that's the way to do it certainly not in a little taco like this so I'm gonna cut the pieces here like this and look at the perfect inside oh my god and then I'm gonna cut against the grain this way right no it's only against and here's what I'm gonna do because I'm in a very charitable mood right now I'll put a piece on here for both you and Chauncey there hasn't been a thing I've given a chance that he hasn't like heats everything and this oh my effing god am i right boys insane chance dude what did you do you've related a little dance he did a little dance you said that the other day something I gave you made you dance okay we've got against the grain seats doesn't come out of my mouth the right way we cut against the grain we got a bunch of that but now I can take my tortillas that I'm just using these I'm using flour small ish street size Street I'm using small street taco size once so I'll throw one of these guys on get it hot and then the magic happens oh don't misunderstand me it is going to be magic real magic tortilla down now our avocado crema goes on here and now our carne so of the long pieces that I cut I cut them down the middle so they're tinier bites and easier to eat not that it really needs to be because this is so damn tender oh I just got excited in every way possible and now just a little bit of the tomato onion and cilantro and that ladies and gentlemen is a near-perfect carne asada taco I mean I changed my mind after one bite but right now near perfect sorry can you just get a get a look at that perfect color in there you see that I mean jeez medium rare folks I know there's where's well-done people out there but but but you try and get them out of your lives please and if they want to cook more here's what you do you cook it to this point and then eat give them the rest and they can go do what they want
