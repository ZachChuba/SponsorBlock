All of the extras are dancers? How does a shot like this even get shot? It's so seamless now that you don't-- because your brain goes like "Oh." Half the series
one of my electricians is dressed as a lamp operators. What did you do about the
hard light? This was hard-- For close-ups and things like that? It's just hard in the
close-ups all right. What's going on Indy Mogul today I'm here with Emmy winning David Mullen, ASC the cinematographer behind the show of "Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" Maisel
is coming back next month so today we're gonna do a walk-through of the camera
choices, the lens choices, the lighting, and then also walk through a couple of
scenes and how they were actually accomplished. How was the experience of
shooting "Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" It's an extremely fun shown to work on, a bit
exhausting but fun. The big issue is just what is the period look for the
show they wanted to be vibrant - energetic and lively but still feel like
something of the aesthetics of the 50s in terms of color schemes and stuff so a
lot of it was about looking at historical reference combined with
period photography, advertisements are a big thing, movies to work out the color
schemes and things but camera wise I felt like the Alexa would give us the
most film ish quality shooting digital we ended up at Panavision
lenses and I chose primo lenses because I wanted to use fairly low flare modern
lenses because we do so much camera work that constantly looks into lights and
windows and I have to do 360 degrees shots on location that if a lens flares
too much then it could be distracting over the actors and I could control that
better with filters I just been using the Hollywood black magics for several years
very familiar with these filters trouble is that there occasionally still a shot
where you're shooting into such a bright light or bright window or light hitting
the lens that you see some weird ring or some sort of strange glow I tested
various diffusion filters the best were the Tiffen black diffusion effects
filters so I use those when I have bright lights or bright windows so
sometimes I will mix and match filters if I want more of a hazy glow and less
of the blurry glow I would I would play around with the types of filters. Amy
doesn't want tight shots so even though we're moving around in tight spaces she
wants to keep it like waist up so that tends to push you in there with wider
angle lenses we'd go 24 on the wider shots we use the 30 a lot
coverage although when we get into the performances with multiple cameras I go
to zoom lenses often. Let's break into one of these performances right now you
start with the first scene let's play the clip. Oh this is the opening of the
pilot episode of "Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" it's a flashback to the day of Midge's
wedding to Joel. ["Because fitting into this dress required no solid food for three
straight weeks who does that I do a day is perfect it's like a dream or
nightmare if you're my father."] So it sets up a lot of the tone of the show her
talking in front of a microphone being the most obvious one so we went for this
Doctor Zhivago it's winter ice palace theme look but I didn't want to light
the actors with blue light so it's a square room right here centre door like
this and there's a door in the background and those windows on this
side and there's some little windows on this side so I put a square lighting
balloon right over here. And this just floated up with helium right above her
right? I had to move it around a little because
what I've learned with top light is that if you're lighting a person especially
an actress that you wanted to look attractive you don't want them under the
center you want them on the edge you want them standing here so that they're
slightly front toplit rather-- So some of this light can kind of come here and
fill in those facts not to toppy because the balloon went this way her
parents are sitting back here and her friends and family are all farther from
the center of the balloon I had to hide a few Lekos around the room. So these
you probably put them right here and they're bouncing into the ceiling and then
bouncing back down. Yeah, it's also four chandeliers basically doing the corners
of the room and then they added some chandeliers on the stage hidden in the
beam of the stage I just I hung two daylight key no flaws so they put a
bluish soft top light on the the band. And this is just natural
daylight coming in? You know I might have had a little bit of HMI bounce to add to
them as the light change because I did have some mix of Sun and then no Sun
knowing that the next sort of flashbacks would be warm I wanted to keep this on
the cold side so you know that was the basic approach to the wedding they
basically said they didn't want a golden honeycomb sepia tone look for this show
even set in the past so I have to be very careful about what scenes I choose
to be warm that's why if I have a lot of warm scenes in the show I will try to
punctuate it with a seam lit with some blue light I'd say most of time is a
single-camera show because we move the camera so much yeah but when we get in
these crowd scenes and performance scenes where she's in front of a mic it
becomes a multi camera show where we have two to three cameras running just
trying to get as much as we can within the time we have
okay so montage that opens episode 4 which is the day she moves out of her
apartment it match cuts shots of her the day she moved in with the day she moves
out and at some point I just committed to feeling like the day she moves out
she'd be kind of cold and overcast and the day she's her happy members should
be warm and golden so knowing that I knew that even though we matched the
angles there would be a shift in color when we crossed dissolved from the past
of the present but then we climax with a shot that had to be completely seamless
where were we she were circling her during a New Year's Eve party and then
as we're circling her suddenly the room is completely empty and it's the day
she's moved out and then now the apartment is completely empty in the
state I'm Amy said when we Circle her I wanted to transition to the present and
not see the transition I wanted to be as invisible as possible let's yeah wait wait wait we're doing I
told everyone that one more time okay a party so this was shot before lunch yeah
and then right here we've repeated the move and so how are you going to hide
that transition issues why change the color change even things like I said you
know if she's wearing one outfit and one seen another and the other you're gonna
see the outfit change you're gonna see her hair if it's good you know what she
describes essentially as a morph right so we're gonna morph from one shot to
the other and make it as invisible as possible but then you have to start
thinking what's going to change her clothes are gonna change your hair it's
gonna change the walls are gonna change it's a moving shot so I try to have the
moment a transition happened the moment there was a blank wall behind her head
so you wouldn't see the furniture magically disappear in the shot you have
the perfect moment happens to be a rage and so we end up having the redesign her
party dress so that it was a similar in design to her moving date outfit so you
wouldn't see sleeves disappear like go from a sleeveless dress to a sleeve
dress the two outfits are similar enough her hairstyle is similar enough but even
then I still had to deal with the fact that we go from a night scene to a day
scene even though it was a day soon and she would be lit more from the windows I
had an overhead soft top light for the night party scene that I kept on for the
day scene and we actually shot the day scene right after lunch because the
visual effects supervisor was worried that we would have too many changes if
we shot them on different days and it's something that normally would do with
motion control to have a perfect match dissolves no way to do this with motion
control so I had to be a Steadicam essentially we shot to the past shot and
then we played it back on the Steadicam monitor with an overlay so the Steadicam
operator Jim McConkey could line up the walls and the furniture and the
fireplace behind her head as best he could and then after he sort of practice
it enough he just you didn't do every take with an overlay the visual effects
Leslie Foster Robson had to steal bits and pieces of each take to get the
mantlepiece and everything to line up it wasn't just a simple straight morph but
it's so seamless now that you don't use your brain goes like Oh
that is crazy here we go in the pilot you see this big Steadicam move like the
Goodfellas where you're out on the street and you follow someone you end up
going through the door you see the whole room you see a band playing on stage and
you follow Mitch all the way up to this bar counter here a lot of people today
like soft lighting you know it's more flattering we shot the Gaslight
originally in the pilot in a black box theater space that was in these Village
Gaslight you know it was a real historical place and we had reference
photos but the reference photos were all like shot with flash photography they
have no feeling for what the lighting might have been like I have to like the
audience have to like the bar area and have to light the stage but it
essentially it's a raised seating area mm-hmm and there's a stage area with a
piano mm-hmm this room has these kind of acorn lights they're just like a six or
eight of them in the room that sort of give you a general warm yeah but they're
dimmed down so they don't really do much other than put a little dim fill light
on everyone all through the room there's a there was a grid you know pipe grid
that I could hang from a me was very concerned that she didn't even though I
had all these lights in this room that she didn't want the room itself be too
bright she wanted the stage to be bright and the bodies to be in the dark
I needed some lights on the audience because partly we have dialogue in the
audience sometimes but dimmed way down so I tried to keep him backlit sort of
just etched out the question was when she started performing is do I put a
follow spot dead center or do I do it from the corners you know 80 to 90
percent of the series it was always this one here so we had a leak oh and half
the series and one of my electricians is dressed as a lamp operators what did you
do about the hard light in terms of this was hard yeah it was just hard well
for close-ups and things like that's just hard in the close-ups alright Amy
wanted to do a 360 degree crane move that was not a dead overhead circle but
she said it was more like a ferris wheel ride that was high at one end and low at
the others of the camera is is doing this weird loop from high to low as they
dance this is a flashback and it's not a
fantasy so I thought well it's a dance number he takes her dancing it kind of
cool if though there was some colored lighting but I can't justify it it's not
a fantasy all right this happened around it was real
well after we were scouted the same he said could we have the light just
changed like to some colored lighting like you guys were on the same way
normally we got camera circles yeah the best way to like people is from the
center of the circle so then the camera's not shadowing them but the
trouble is the circle has been created with a crane arm doing this so I knew
the arm of the crane would cross the center and I couldn't like them from the
center so I had to like them from under the high point of the crane wherever the
camera is the highest is where the light is hitting them so hopefully the arm is
not throwing a shadow so this is 7th Avenue I think and then so the diner is
here in the middle and so we had a whole scene in the diner and then they come
out and he stands the middle of street and she's on the sidewalk and as a kiss
week attach the movi to the technical crane so you guys are literally alive
rigging it and a magnet system so we attach it with a magnet to the technic
crane and we put a safety chain on it so the Technic rain is here on the sidewalk
like this so the move goes high here and then it swings around and then drops
down back to here again low so it's the arm swings through the center of the
circle cameras looking back at the arm yeah you know to like this for a dance
number where the light actually changes from white to pink at the start of the
shot I have a one Condor with white light lighting the whole block and then
next to it I have another Condor with a pink light on it that fades up and way
over here I had another Condor just to put some fill like this direction on
them it's the key here that ones here that yeah the light on this Condor is
still lower than this camera position so the light itself is getting under the
lens and lighting them so so it lights it from underneath if they had been the
same height then what happened is this high point I would have had a big shadow
of the camera on on everything here so this light has to be lower than this
camera at this point the episode Amy likes to hire dancers to
play extras some of these shots are so complicated that we need extras that can
time themselves to the camera so she'll bring in our choreographer Marguerite it
makes sense it makes perfect sense they're dancing to a beat they're
dancing to a rhythm the shot is so fast if you wanna the story point is that she's been after
the first season where she gets confronted in the altman's she gets
demoted so we begin the second season she's now been demoted to the
switchboard room in the basement is said to be choreographed for a couple days
they were practicing in the set and then we saw her her cyl and then had to
figure out how to move the camera with her and we know it going with the movi
on a stick it's he's holding it on the end of a
pole but he's still holding there with his arms
yeah that's Larry McConkey and Jim macaques on the wheels operating while
arias on the pole because a movi move is really a two-person job
two people are in sync with each other we started high and we we push down on
the basket immediately tilt up fast yeah and then follow the letter basket around
until we enter the room and as we enter the room the question was which side of
the heads do we do the hardest thing and go between the heads and each person had
leaned out of the way of the movies I had to have art department install these
light bulbs along the switchboard so they would have light in their eyes and
I decided to gel the fluorescence above them with some blue green gel so they
would have this kind of cyan quality and then the light bulbs have created a
color contrast again because otherwise the only light was the fluorescence in
the center of the room which was throwing a shadow on their faces how are
you not worried about the the movie blocking the light glass the other
problem is like I was worried I would see a shadow of the movi crossing every
light bulb on their face because these are the labels here they're cuddly it
didn't each person has to get it away of the camera but didn't get right back
into position again she's smoking the whole time - David what on and this is a
case where I had to switch the filters because I told you that sometimes with
lights in the frame you get a weird halo from the Hollywood black man yeah so I
had to use the tiffin black diffusion effects filter because you're shooting
these like yeah as I passed each light bulb they were so big and frame and I
got this strange halo glow from the filter he's interesting but it's also
distracting I don't have the audience to look at the LEDs yeah sometimes you get
a weird glowing and your eye goes to it and then
looking at the actor they're looking at the strange halo it was like it's
honestly like the Super Bowl of camera movements yeah it's like you have the
best talent with the best tools with the wildest craziest vision choreographed a
dancer and save it thank you so much for joining us seriously the best being able
to learn a little bit about the behind the scenes process I know Mazal comes
back soon too as well summer syncs December 6th okay so one of those places
coming back number six I first of all I can't wait to see it as well because we
have a crazy shot in the first step to southern calling me asking me how again
