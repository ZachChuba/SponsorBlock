[Music] trouble for Bernie Sanders today after a new poll shows many Americans are taking issue with his age is the senator too old to be the next James Bond from the onion an onion Public Radio I'm

today that shows an increasing number of Americans believe Bernie Sanders is too old to be the next James Bond the poll said that 6 out of 10 Americans are skeptical of an octogenarian carrying out the duties of mi6 his most daring spy and even more said that they weren't positive that the Vermont senator could last for more than one film installment in the iconic franchise opr political entertainment reporter Marci Hammond has been covering the new poll and she joins us now hello Marci I think this is the question on everyone's mind should Sanders be concerned that his age might ultimately keep him from shooting bad guys and seducing gorgeous women while wearing a tight-fitting tuxedo I think this poll should worry Sanders definitely people just aren't confident he's physically up for the demands of being double-oh-seven from brawls atop high-speed moving trains constantly getting thrown through windows to being tied naked to a chair and having your balls whipped a lot of people just think it would be too much for the senator to handle but to be fair the role of James Bond isn't all physical in fact one could argue it's primarily mental and largely ceremonial well that's been a main counter-argument from Sanders supporters when his age is discussed they are quick to remind you that being James Bond isn't just about hand-to-hand combat with an 8 foot tall man with steel teeth but mostly about planting explosive briefcases by her enemies restaurant table or simply just walking the beach shirtless but is that argument enough to ease the fears that Sanders no longer has the strength to hold on to a damsel in distress with one hand while holding on to a rope attached to a helicopter flying through the air with the other not as much as Sanders would probably hope the polls showed that beyond concerns about Sanders physical well-being nearly 50% of Americans worried that his mental acuity would slip with age and result in him possibly forgetting complex fault codes or blanking on where he left his gun during a critical mission I'm sure his heart attack in late 2019 doesn't help either right and the Sanders camp knows that that's why they've been putting out videos on social media over the past few months of Sanders leaping across building tops and injecting himself from cars zigzagging through Rome at dangerous speeds they want to show that the senator is up for whatever mission mi6 sends him on now couldn't they also bring up the fact that at age 57 Roger Moore was the oldest James Bond of all time when he filmed a view to a kill and he's generally regarded as one of the best bonds ever true older can be better but even if they managed to whip out a script and rush into production right now Sanders will be well into his 80s by the time the second film came around I think it's the sentiment of a lot of people that if Bernie really wanted to be James Bond then his best bet was in 2016 when no time to die was casting right I'll be curious to see how this all shakes out personally I think it's time a woman plays the role of Bond I know I wouldn't mind watching amy klobuchar punch rami malek in the mouth that would be pretty entertaining that's o P arse Marcy Hammond thanks Marcy well it's the big question that has plagued scientists for decades but today it's looking like we might finally have some answers earlier this week a team of researchers at Miami University released an historic study explaining why Doritos bags have their bright distinctive coloring to help shed some light on their extraordinary findings were joined by OPRS Morgan to Maude's hello Morgan hi Leslie no I've always wondered this myself so tell us why exactly are Doritos bags so colorful well to put it simply Doritos bags develop their signature neon hue in order to warn potential predators that consuming them could kill them over time through evolution and natural selection they acquired their loud coloring to notify scavengers that the chips contained inside them contain high concentrations of dangerous poison the consumption of which could potentially be lethal fascinating were researchers surprised to discover this yes it actually debunked a lot of long-held theories on Dorito pigmentation before this study many thought that the Doritos were using their coloring either to attract mates or to camouflage themselves similar to how sprite uses its transparency to blend in with its background it wasn't until the last few years of the study that researchers were able to rule out these possibilities and discover the truth that the brighter the bag the more toxic they are here's how the study's lead researcher Boris Petrov explained it varieties like Jack branch dip hot wings or Doritos collision blaze and ultimate cheddar are contained in incredibly bright and elaborately patterned bags this is in order to send the warning to predators that eating them will certainly lead to instant incapacitation and put one at an extremely high risk of death Oh yikes keep those ones away from me so what researchers say this has been an effective survival strategy for Doritos overall yes Doritos have been able to spread to nearly every corner of the 7-eleven ecosystem thanks to this but again according to Petrov this method isn't entirely foolproof most species are smart enough to correctly interpret the signals and avoid dangers others however like humans lack the intelligence to do so and are actually attracted to the fluorescent coloring now they in turn will eat them and end up doubled over riddled with nausea and extreme pain and in some cases dead this is why we always say that although these chips might look beautiful remember don't get too close it's for your own safety ooh good advice there Oh pr's morgan DeMott reporting Thank You Morgan Thank You Leslie is there something interfering with your just because these stories are at the end of the show doesn't mean they're any less important we just have a lot less to say about them here's what else you need to know today climate experts are warning that global warming could cause a dangerous increase in songs of the summer a new report released today estimates an annual increase of three to four post Malone tracks by the year 2024 alone in Des Moines Iowa a police officer on desk duty was placed on unpaid leave after brutally beating a filing cabinet drawer that wouldn't shut when the officer told it to and lastly a new report found that everything is slightly worse than it was yesterday and yes you guessed it it's going to be even worse tomorrow and that's it for the topical today I'm Leslie price if you enjoyed hearing the news today don't forget to Like and subscribe wherever you get your
