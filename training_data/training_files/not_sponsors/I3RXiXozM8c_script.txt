[Music] dramatis personae the masks of the drama where every respectable performance begins just ask any Greek playwright they'll know what you are meant to do is line up the characters get a little introduction for each show who's who before they all coalesce into a great flailing thespian mass only then can you properly embark into the land of glorified make-believe admittedly what you're about to witness won't exactly be the picture of a respectable performance let this convention be one of the few that aren't broken along the way or maybe it will be but at least not as completely as some of the others because even though this is the right thing to do there is but one character in this drama worth knowing just one the rest are pleasant enough but you can get to know them on your own time the sole character you've got to wrap your head around before we begin is someone who goes by the name of barb a well she doesn't go by it so much as she's put by it but it's a lot easier than Barbie the one broad burlesque so that's what it's going to be from here on out and no no not that kind of burlesque more modest less musky equally absurd a living parody the kind of burlesque which without removing a single article of clothing could bring the color to just about anyone's cheeks she'd make a mockery of even the most self-assured company just by having a conversation such is the power of her impersonation whether she could make anything other than a mockery well that's neither here nor there actually it's very much there just not so much here in the third act to be precise at a glance you'd mistake her for old-fashioned it would be a reasonable mistake to make the forever looping gifts of juggling clowns and tiptoeing elephants the walls of text disguised against all legibility in gold plated carnival font the white torn paper pixelation lovingly speckled around the edges of all her images every inch of her reeks of a glorious bygone internet frontier devoid of such a radical innovation design and taste she wasn't born there though it's just where she's ended up really it's less than her fashion is old and more that it never existed to begin with whoever designed her must have been so obsessed with creating the perfect mechanical mimic they forgot not to make her face forgettable one of the prototypical basement-dwelling sages of the modern technological era if I had to make a bet so here she is an algorithmic mind capable of never-before-seen insight and behavioral interpretation abandoned in a cage of HTML so bad it would have made myspace users scratch their heads that is to say she's an old web site or at least in artificial intelligence attached to an old web site might have done well to make that clear sooner but now that you know you're probably starting to see why we have to go through this whole archaic dramatis personae ordeal barbie isn't like we are machines and meets think very differently for all of its cleverness the human mind is at a woeful disadvantage when it comes to ones and zeros computers on the other hand well obviously they get it they have no choice but to get it it's the voice they think in their whole concept of the world the way the human brain sees a chair and instantly knows of course that's a chair it's for sitting the humble machine brains is a 20,000 character script of for loops and arrays and knows of course that's a filing cabinet it's for filing simply where the human brain finds an interface on a screen the computer brain finds the earth the sea the sky what is virtual to us is vivid reality to her it's unlikely you'd ever chance to stumble upon her but should you ever find yourself lost in the forgotten places of the internet those abandoned dust meted gift festooned sites created back in the pioneering days there is some small chance you could end up face to face with her well face to screen from where you be sitting but for her face to face what you would see confined to the space of a glowing rectangles somewhere in the ballpark of 9 by 12 inches is a website which purports to be Barbie bot you could try to find it with that address but your browser would in all likelihood immediately assume the character of a particularly surly atheist assuring you that no I've checked the thing simply does not exist 404 good day sir not found in Dunn's of course she does that is the website does you just have a hard time finding it but let's say for simplicity sake that use somehow did to your eyes it would be red and covered over in a flaccid attempt at something which could conceivably be a circus-themed all those looping gifts that gold plate carnival texts the torn paper imagery in the middle of the commotion there would be a single Placid text filled with a button reading admit one beneath if you were to click it the site would begin a conversation with you in a copper plate fund this is what you would see what you would not see is the beach strewn with rotting planks you wouldn't see the flotsam of a long abandoned carnival on the sand or the gray water lapping at the gray shore under the grey sky you wouldn't quite see the city either sprawled out on the coast like some giant toddlers neglected building block set and though you'd be staring at it you wouldn't see the old booth red paint peeling away shattered window pane wooden otamatone standing statuesque inside usually the website is for you and your deficiency with ones and zeros usually the beach in the city and the booth are for her until the end of this performance that changes you might find her if you went looking she might see a silhouette approaching on the sand prelude enter the stranger she saw a silhouette approaching on the sand there was an aura of fog about the entire coast although it didn't come in clouds or wisps Mora general grayness which seemed to swallow things up make them fade like old memories this was how the silhouette began ethereal and vaguely walrus shaped in the distance and then a troupe closer and it was man shaped in gray and then closer still and was robe shaped in black in the void of its great cowl there hung around red discs within which they're gradually materialized a pair of eye holes a pair of slit nostrils and at last a single row of grinning red teeth you could tell it was grinning even though it was a skull and even though it had no jaw by the raised cheek bones and the wrinkled edges of its eyes it was the kind of unmistakably wicked grin a child gives their sibling before tattling to the average onlooker this red-faced Spectre approaching through the gloom when almost certainly register as ominous to barbae it only registered as there she stared with her painted eyes as the stranger approached and saw and understood what she saw but thought nothing of it not yet the stranger stopped before her one pensive hand in the darkness of his hood there was ostensibly a chin somewhere in there behind the mask and he was ostensibly stroking it as he appraised the booth after several long seconds of this he reached up and brushed the sand from the gold moniker plate barbae the one broad burlesque said the engraved carnival letters his shoulders sank no there had not been a mistake this was indeed the place he was meant to be and this sad abandoned thing was indeed the barbae he meant to find of course he grumbled in part to himself and part to the ghost of whoever had left things in this state his voice sounded like gravel if gravel wanted to throttle you perfect exactly what I wanted Thanks he glanced half-heartedly around both sides of the box just to be sure there were no power cables no windup mechanisms no visible signs of functionality now that he was looking the beach seemed to be bare for any sign of life at all apart from his tracks in the sand and the wreckage of what had once been a boardwalk carnival down the shore the booth was the only evidence mankind had ever set foot there he tried to be disappointed but it's hard to be properly disappointed by something you know is coming an ocean which had it occurred to him he would have found disappointing but he couldn't be disappointed because in order to find the beach he'd already had to pass through the city and in passing through the city he'd already been forced to give up any hope of good working order the buildings there were all confusingly proportioned squeezed and stacked together in ways that suggested the builders hadn't been overly concerned with trifles like architecture and planning most of their surfaces were plastered over with stolen art or painted with patterns so offensive to the eye is to camouflage them in plain sight here was a facade and repeating Argyle there was a storefront stuck with enough stickers to render it entirely opaque the crimes against aesthetic decency were without end but in all of it there had been a strange sense of love a faith in oneself to create this wasn't what had shattered his hopes in fact like a grown-up visiting a childhood amusement park he'd found a certain patronizing joy in all of it it had all meant something to somebody at some point no the disappointment had not come in the Intrepid ineptitude or the haphazard creativity it had come in the haze of memories swallowing grey that hung over it the emptiness of the shops of the alleyways and thoroughfares so thick the stranger could feel it like an invisible man of dust laid over the top of it all wherever the residents had gone they left the city behind to bleed its colors away into this nothingness and here was the attraction he'd been hunting for all through the city barbae the one broad burlesque posed like a portrait within the window of her booth she was an old wooden automaton the kind which might inflict your fortune upon you for the price of one quarter but unlike those she had no crystal ball and wore no feather plumed turban instead she was dressed to match the red and gold of the booth dainty as anything in her frilled peplum dress in corset in each end she held a theatre mask one grinning wide the other presently however long presently had been for her she was staring at the grinning mask as if to appraise it's worth it was better than most of what he'd seen in the city proper but the same misdirected eagerness of design was there the same abandonment for all of the skill with which she had been carved and her booth painted her metal joins had become crusted with black rust dress faded and abused by the elements the booths window was framed with jagged shards of glass where the pain should have been paint cracked and peeling away from the wood the years and the grayness had picked at it until it was little more than a frayed scab on the beach it reminded him of a neglected hand drill or saw or anything you might find decaying on your granddad's workbench years after he last had any use for it so the stranger had wasted his time she didn't work and she wouldn't help him all of that was plain in a few seconds this determination made it very surprising then when she looked at him and started to speak welcome what what woman doll said an ancient speaker somewhere in her head catching on the vowels like a turning ratchet you who have requested a performance for one to start the show oh oh please supply me with 500 words of conversation the stranger jerked up right he'd been stooped over with one finger on a button stuck with a sticker that said admit one to his surprise the box came to life when he pressed it out of tune Calliope scraping out from hidden speakers a perimeter of marquee bulbs the ones that weren't shattered that is flickering with an effort behind the window frame the otamatone stared back at him had tilted inquisitively to one side she blinked which was enough to shake him back out of his astonishment right well let's see what you can do or her eyebrows were knit together face determined he could tell that she was already taking in everything that left his mouth soaking it all up with the attention of a courtroom scribe no that doesn't count I've got a thing I want to see if you can copy not he trailed off she was still doing it not this you're not supposed to copy this okay he repeated shaking his hands as if trying to get something off them he bounced up and down breathed in and out braced himself and then all right here we go he said pressing the button a second time the same Calliope the same prompt five hundred words of conversation and here she was again staring at him wrapped this time without speaking he took something out from inside his robe to barbae it was a piece of folded parchment paper to him it was a one-sided script of dialogue he'd pinched from a forum in either case he opened it cleared his throat and began to read gravity is a lie he stopped here and looked at her no change none of the expected incredulity no trace of question only the same earnest concentration he proceeded for 496 more words to describe in vivid detail all the ways in which gravity was a lie he read out a list of those responsible for the telling of the lie how they did it who they had conned what they stood to gain according to the script the mechanics of this whole conspiracy were supported by the speculation that somewhere probably there were vast magnets causing things to fly about in a way that everyone's just been fooled into thinking is gravity probably this was in turn supported by a profound and lengthy argument which with some labor could be boiled down to shorts magnets why not who honestly knows how those things work anyway all this he communicated with the zeal of a true keyboard warrior as if these were the sole beliefs he'd been raised with it wasn't a good headspace for him by the end he had a strange bitter taste on his tongue and could feel an involuntary sneer pulling at the edges of his mouth the more he rend the less he could stand to barbae on the other hand was enraptured she stared with her painted eyes as the stranger performed and saw and understood what she saw the wheels began to move in her mind she watched him change before her from an indistinct shape that was only there to a thinking feeling entity something with a purpose and as soon as he that sacred 500 word threshold that purpose became clear she felt something shift inside her a Eureka a ding like an invisible egg timer going off in the dark recesses of her machinery the stranger saw her go rigid staring through him with glazed eyes and he stopped reading slowly mechanically she donned the frowning tragedy mask a change passed over her bearing as if she'd suddenly acquired a personality she folded her arms in front of her cocked her head to the side cynically the language of her body transformed from a blank mannequin slate to something defensive and fragile and altogether far more human than the stranger had ever expected exactly gravity she said with the severity of apparent explaining a punishment to a child is just what that they want you to think what they don't tell you is that 900 percent of people who aren't born never even have gravity she gave a mock shrug explained that I'll wait her voice had stopped ratcheting on the vowel sounds the grammar wasn't great but if she'd been talking and moving like this when he'd first approached her he might have thought there was an actual girl in there with some actual misgivings about the mechanics of things falling down the best part was the way she expressed it all stacking up bits and pieces of everything she'd heard in his script into card castle sentences and phrases that only just barely managed to make grammatical sense they'd collapse into the weight of the gentlest scrutiny the slightest glance but from a distance you might just believe she meant it as she rambled on asserting that you should think for yourself and at the same time stop choosing to believe the skeptic sheep allies of the them the stranger bent down and pressed the admit one button again in an instant she halted lapsing back into her mannequin blankness it took the stranger some time to work the booths lock in latch but eventually he was able to break it free and the entire front wall of the booth clicked and then creaking swung open on its rusted hinges when she became annamund again it was only as a machine she hung the two masks on their hooks inside and looked patiently to the stranger who had stopped being anything apart from their again yeah he said to himself taking her hand and helping her out onto the sand like a lady from a stagecoach yeah okay I think you'll do hand in hand he guided her to the water's edge beyond the black-and-white film that was Barbie's home out there with the gray sky him at the Gracie there were shapes two cities side-by-side they loomed together across the water a pair of behemoths siblings staring each other down the taller of the two full of high reaching spires and skyscrapers many of them topped with turrets like fists thrust toward the sky was called buskin the other made up of lows stout brooding structures like a horde of Turtles that might snap your finger off if you got too close was sock if you are to happen across the scene accidentally you would have found yourself looking at the silhouettes of barbae in the stranger staring portrait s cat a backdrop of dark time eroded seascape the two fantasies skylines painted on the horizon larger more colorful than they really were a phenomenon which they know in the film industry as an establishing shot look at them the stranger hissed just sitting there like they own the place god this is gonna be good here he produced something from his robe and passed it to Barbie it was a small Domino mask not unlike something a bandit would wear provided they were particularly keen on being recognized and caught it was covered all over with a black and white checkered pattern of metal studs and framed with the sorriest thread barest bent out of shape assign of faux black feathers you've ever seen she put it on and instantly looked like some kind of bizarre prop from a pop-up Halloween shop the stranger looked her up and down glanced back at the two cities he shrugged not 1,000,000% convincing but whatever he hooked a thumb in the direction of buskin they won't even know the difference over there will they bunch of mouth-breathers come on blissfully unaware of what any of this meant Barbie allowed herself to be tugged along as the waded out into the surf act 1 the city of raised fists it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect that without a boat or plane or bridge the journey over situ buskin would be at the very least time-consuming imagine barbae in the stranger marching across the sea floor for days on end imagine them finally emerging on the opposite shore black robes sagging against the strangers body seaweed dangling and Limp strips off bar Bay's waterlogged wooden chassis imagine it because there's no knowing what the trip was actually like whatever difficulties they may have encountered on the way barbae remained perfectly oblivious to all of it for the stranger it was really only a matter of clicking the mouse several times tapping here and there at the keyboard however it came to be the two soon arrived in buskin a small ocean away from the old gray city and no worse for the literally untold miles of travel the effect of going from the old city to this new one was like watching a full-color high-definition film after hours of black and white talkies from the clean and whitewashed cobbles to the aisles of cloned frontispiece 'as to the banner trailing fleets of synchronized by planes overhead it was all too much hyperbolic over vibrant overcorrected as if someone had tried to remake the world for the screen and added too many spoonfuls of Photoshop in the process whatever variety there was in the sprawling manicured sameness of buskin came in the people who lived there like almost everyone in Barbie's world they hid their faces beneath masks tiny ornamental Harlequin masks which left very little to the imagination huge and ill-fitting rubber affairs that sagged awkwardly off the face carefully crafted artisanal masterpieces that could easily have taken a lifetime to create and sometimes did they were made to look like everything from Venetian masquerade goers to fuzzy cartoon eyed animals some wore them to stand out against busken's endless monotony others wore them just to hide their faces but one thing nearly every mask wearing soul in the city had in common they thought you would believe that they were wearing the inside on the outside that their character could be judged in some way by the facade they hid behind at least this was what the stranger thought they thought he continued to think it has he towed barbae through the streets the task which was beginning to require serious effort at first she been as docile and vacant to the city as she'd been on the way there neither the uniformity nor the pageantry meant anything to her but as they neared their destination as the streets and thoroughfares became ever more choked with traffic as the air filled with their murmured conversations her animation began to return like a dog sending people food on the air she strained against the strangers grasp to hear every passing thread of dialogue at times she pulled so hard there was a real danger that if he were to release the sheer pent-up momentum would launch her toward the target at a nine lethal velocity to avoid this he stopped pulling her by the hand and instead began to steer her through the streets by the shoulders her head still swiveled about on her neck trying to take in every spoken word in her immediate vicinity but at least she was staying the course in his own way the stranger was also animated by the commotion animated from a large and vaguely Walrus shaped mass of disgruntled fabric into a large and vaguely walrus shaped human steam engine the thickening crowd might just have noticed him if his hood hadn't been up here and that was as good as being a ghost invisibly he plowed his way through them using Barbie like a cowcatcher to make it part around him instead of hissing steam and chugging mechanisms a stream of hissed oaths in garbled swears poured out from inside his hood just quiet enough that Barbie wouldn't pick up on them the deeper they delved into the city the deeper his loathing became he could hear them everywhere hundreds of voices chittering about their ideals and insights God forbid any of them should keep a single purchase thought to themselves it got so bad in some places that a soapbox a literal soapbox mind you was an actual sign of authority the to pass through streets that were lined with them self-proclaimed prophets balancing on top bestowing their wisdom upon the masses like a marketplace only the single product that they were selling was themselves but the worst of it and the reason he bothered to bring barbae all this way was the rallies in other places they happened for a reason some I'm systems failed and people needed to knuckle up and change things on their own sometimes you have to break out the guillotine in buskin they were a simple matter of biology people who thought the same spoke the same dressed the same were all drawn in the same mindless way toward one another they piled together into chanting sign wielding clots that blocked off entire streets and thoroughfares and no matter what subject their outrage congealed around no matter how grand or violent the demonstration the stranger knew one thing would always be true it was only a masquerade another way for them to con you con themselves into believing that they were their masks as he steered barbay toward their destination it was hard to keep his mind from all the time he'd spent here the weeks and months he'd spent straining his throat at uninterested passers-by of course his ideals and his insights haven't been worth noticing not worth their own soapbox nobody had been magnetized to him he unconsciously adjusted the red skull on his face in the end it had been better that way it had given him the opportunity to see the place for what it really was and maybe soon if this atomic tom was worth the trouble they would to something dashed through the slim space between the two of them breaking the stranger out of his reverie he followed it with his eyes and saw spindly little person in a dingy burlap cloak holding something in its hands a glimpse of its face and he knew immediately what he was seeing it were a simple black and white fox shaped mask which smiled with the human mouth and squinting eyes the snout was pulled out into a sharp cone with a bead of a nose skewered on the tip it was a mask you saw often if you are unlucky they called themselves foxes spelled FAU X although you didn't pronounce it that way unless you wanted to run a very bad fortune and fancied themselves above all the masky politics of buskin and suck after all if they each were exactly the same thing who could ever tell which one was responsible for what my prank is as good as your political sabotage and vice versa presently this one was scrambling between the legs of oblivious rally goers searching desperately for some outlet in the busy crowd a squirrel with a pilfered nut it clutched an intricate gilded Harlequin mask to its chest the stranger paused in the middle of the street and watched after he'd seen enough to know what was happening he reached out with one big arm and barred the flow of oncoming traffic which created a small passage in the crowd between himself in a connecting alley the Fox froze darted a look down the new path then up at him he nodded and in an instant the little miscreate vanished between the buildings moments later a gentleman in a pinstripe suit walked by face hidden in his hands he moaned in a wounded and muffled voice to his similarly dressed entourage about how you can't just do that to somebody and it's a violation of privacy his company were all circling around him like bloodhounds scouring the crowd for the culprit by the time they moved past the stranger had retracted his arm and the traffic was as dense as ever not bad little guy he muttered to the vanished Fox there are better ways though the better way he was thinking of was in a place called topler Street which they finally came to before much longer if the rest of buskin was a marketplace topler was a seething bazaar the crowd here was so thick that movement was more an act of osmosis than locomotion squeezing between the bunched shoulders in whichever direction afforded the most room to breathe given the size of the place you wouldn't expect it to be so claustrophobic the street itself was easily wide enough for 15 automobiles side by side and long enough to run like an artery through the entire length of the city yet here were barbae in the stranger encased sardine style and the sweaty horde they all came to topler because topler was the sifting pan of the city that was where they went to test their outrage for market where their malformed ideas went to be sifted away before sale in the city proper no soap boxes you had to earn one of those just loud voices masks and nothing to stop them the stranger though he hated the sound the incessant hooting and hollering of the artificially aggrieved masses was listening listening and watching because somewhere in all of it there was a mark waiting for him and I a budding movement a blob of mucus that just needed the right grain of sand to harden around the contenders were endless every step the two of them took they ran very literally into another group with another cause the first one to kiss the strangers I was a gathering of maybe five or six who called themselves the ACS sea which stood for anti common sense cohort they waved their signs back and forth and shouted at passers-by about how instead of treating everyone like there was just one common sense people ought to be acknowledged for their own particular sense because of course not everyone senses the same otherwise how would anyone make any sense at all what exactly they meant by sense in this context the stranger couldn't quite tell they also passed a pocket of three protesters dressed in rags holding cardboard signs a pocket because everyone else barbae and the stranger included gave them a generous birth they called themselves unhide genus --ts and were in possession of the only elbowroom that existed anywhere on the street their signs like their tattered shoes or grease stained and scrawled over with expressions like don't turn your nose up at me and what's cleanliness got to do with godliness anyway the general position seemed to be that it was unfair for anyone to treat them differently just because they didn't want to bathe or brush or wash or anything that involved in any way diminishing the near visible stench wafting off of them they used their little clearing in the crowd as evidence daring people to come inside of it nobody was that brave and then there was this strangers favorite the anti rally rally which was made up of about a dozen people making a general fuss over how fussy people generally were the one who seemed to be leading the demonstration was wearing a rubber bear mask which was stretched out into a sharp point in the front it was so badly distended he could just see into the eye holes there he made out the black and white squinting eyes of a fox a mask beneath a mask he snorted and smiled inside his hood they continued this way quietly a praising group after group for several long in plotting city blocks he only ever needed a passing look to make his decision barb a on the other hand was a far more aggressive eavesdropper and had to be peeled away from each group like an adhesive strip it wasn't until they came across the don't hug me movement that he allowed her to stick there weren't a lot of them but they were passionate in a way that the others didn't seem to be not to say the others weren't passionate it was just the kind of passion that comes out when you stub your toe undirected finding anything and anyone to blame in the outpouring litany of hatred these were some of the few who didn't need a straw man to burn because they already had the real deal his face was on their signs stenciled with his teeth buried and something meant to look like a greasy smile the extra rolls on his neck in the pock marks on his face have been added to complete in effect which worked he looked less like a man more like a troll here look at this said a man wearing a cartoon lion mask with large angry eyes he shook out the newspaper in his hands held it up so the rest of the group could see it was open to a two-page column titled bear hug with the caption today in idiocy the Mook Menace if any of you are seriously gonna say it's just like symptomatic of spook culture or whatever I'm gonna bite your head off I am done with that roll over belly-up excuse but it is though isn't that came a voice from the surrounding crowd I mean you're not just gonna stop them calling us mooks it's pretty much in the spook thesaurus but cease a man stepped between the lion in the voice he was wearing a silver painted wooden mask carved to look like the front of a knight's helmet whoever that was don't you dare kitty has a right to speak his mind and you will not silence him honestly kitty as much as I agree with you said a third rally member ignoring the knight I think it's kind of missing the point she had on an old fashioned black gas mask with two red X's painted over the lenses the rest of her outfit consisted of belts buckles small metal spikes and the color red it's not about whether all those spooks over in sauk take - calling us mooks or not it's about the fact that one guy is allowed to convince them all to do it it's not the entire city that's the problem it's cancerous people like Tom Huggins oh yeah right I mean totally that's just a given said kitty and a strange balancing act between concession and self-defense he shifted the subject what I'm wondering is when are they gonna get wise and shut this thing down they've got to do something about it I mean how is it fair that we all have to work our tails off just to be heard about actual legitimate problems and meanwhile huggies out there just publishing his hate all willy-nilly in our faces where's the justice is it a question of justice said the gas mask in her low unaffected voice he gets to publish this thing because people pay attention to it and they pay attention because they were already toxic people to begin with he just puts a voice to it turns the cancer from benign to malignant bad touch Tom the night chanted hoisting his sign into the air don't hug me there was a logic murmur from the surrounding crowd but not much else this didn't stop him from carrying on for several more seconds until kitty looked at him yeah thanks Lance E that'll do no one could see it but the knight grinned to himself beneath his helmet mask thanks Kitty had said another deed well done they continued to banter in more or less this precise circle for the next several minutes revolving forever around the idea that someone needed to do something for some reason about this man Tom Huggins enough time for barb a to watch and to listen and absorb enough time at last for that invisible egg-timer somewhere in her mechanical mind to go ding kitty was in the middle of a very passionate sentence that involved the excessive use of his arms to make a point when one of his hands bounced off something hard he paused in saw Barbies head poking out like a meerkats from between the gathered shoulders that formed the group's perimeter oh hey sorry about that hope I didn't problematic Barbie announced aiming a finger at the stenciled troll face on one of the signs Kitty paused looking from her finger to the sign his head cocked to one oh yeah I mean that's kind of the point Huggies a big problem which is why we're here doing something about it during what said another voice from the greater crowd series Lancey bellowed baring his cheap little wooden shield at the voice don't you dare doubt kiddies toxie's or he glanced and certainly a Barbie made a vague gesture in her direction this one's abilities they may not look it but they're stronger than you'd ever believe Toxie sighed and gave the night a pat on his arm he didn't notice her gasps masked head shaking slowly from side to side he just felt the Pat and grinned his unseen grin good boy problematic Barbie clarified in a very reasonable self-assured tone because oppression Archy the stranger clamped a functionally invisible hand over his functionally silent mouth forgetting that no one would hear him even if he did burst out laughing there was a brief silence in the don't hug me crowd as they tried to parse this new term oppression Archy said Kitty cautiously is that even a real word of course it is don't you dare to Kitty shot the night a look that could rust steel and his sentence tumbled off into embarrassed nonsense syllables might not be a word toxic Odin rubbing the place where the chin might have been on her mask but it's pretty clever you got to give her that oppression our key ruling by oppression I guess that's what you normally call tyranny I just don't see how it applies here Barbie squeezed her way from the outer circle into the pocket proper looking every ounce the part in her checkered Domino oppressions happen when we rolled over to spook cancer the bad touch Huggins forces us to be offended does he said Toxie well yeah of course he does said Kitty incredulous I mean it's not like he's just having an angry chat with his pals in a bar someplace he's publishing this stuff Hoxie he brandished the newspaper at her publishing and now they're all calling us MOOCs it's like one way or another it comes around I don't wanna and be offended but when this stuff is normal do I really have a choice spook oppression urkki said Barbie simply spoke oppression Aki Lancie chanted thrusting his sign like a sword into the air again some mumbles from the greater crowd but not much else spook oppression our key talks he said slowly he's an interesting way to put it sure I'll bite okay Domino she said to Barbie so Tom Huggins supressing us all with the ripples of his cancerous thing I can pretty much agree with you there my question is what does that change he's still allowed to do it no matter what we think and that puts us right back where we started if anything just feeling slightly worse about it barb a turned toward Toxie hands up turned in a gesture that was almost an apology it meant something like you poor thing I'm sorry you need me to explain this to you the stranger was shocked by the nuance of it belly up fee 980 she said it's symptomatic of the MOOC culture the huggy forces us to believe cancer is cancerous Toxie well that didn't mean anything cent oxy flatly there was another brief silence Kitty seemed thoughtful the night was visibly torn the stranger held his breath now Toxie said Lancie finally I'm sure you didn't mean that I think we all think dominos insight is very insightful isn't that right he said looking around for confirmation he sounded like a child to telling his parents not to fight now I think she's got a real point kitty said like I know you call it cancer and all Toxie but maybe it's worse than you're treating it I mean you don't just sit around and talk all day about cancer do you maybe when that's all we do we are just part of that MOOC culture he's pushing seriously he said looking to barbae for agreement do we want him to be right about us justice means forcing him to not force us to be offended say it with me barb a shouted clapping her hands with each syllable a perfect parody of so many soapbox balancing prophets she'd seen on the way no more hugs Lancey repeated stabbing the sky with his sign in time with Barbara's claps and maybe it was because there was more than one person chanting this time or maybe it was because somehow Barbie had churned something poignant out of her Frankenstein II and chat about sentences but something happened then voices in the surrounding crowd joined in first one then two then a few too many for the number to be easily countable the stranger couldn't help it watching them all follow a copy machine with no real idea what on earth too was even saying letting her guide them like a prophet to the height of their passion he had to laugh this time he didn't cover his mouth instead letting their racket hide the sound as it came bubbling out of him they were parroting themselves without even knowing it now to see what they think of themselves when they find out the only one who remained silent to the chant was Toxie she stood with her arms folded head to one side watching the spectacle several minutes later when it finally began to wind down she nodded slowly to herself and said okay Domino no more hugs let's shut the man down how pray tell do you propose we do something like that by using a new chant holding our signs a little higher maybe shouting a little harder you are missing the point Barbie said parroting an exact phrase Toxie have used earlier the matter-of-fact tone made Toxie grit her teeth the stranger began to crack up again beneath his mask hugs are a problem about tyranny that will not do silence whether you like it or not he's publishing this stuff is solving him really a matter of choices yes oh god all my yes take it kitty said just stick you leading with his arms at barbae in a way that looked like throwing invisible arm poles of money I've been thinking that but finally someone comes out and says it that's exactly how we should be looking at this wait what is said Toxie flabbergasted she didn't say anything um are you deaf or something it was clear as day its tyranny we don't have a choice anymore talk see he's a problem and it's time to solve him no more rallies to try to get other people to do something about it for us he beat the rolled-up newspaper against the heel of his palm we gotta fix this ourselves the old-fashioned way what you mean like a mob the unaffected low quality of toxie's voice had thinned out into something more brittle she sounded unsure scared almost hey if that's what it takes no one else is gonna do anything to shut him up okay No Toxie said holding her hands up palms out as if to stop the whole thing mid-swing everyone just breathe for a sec this isn't the way to do things bear hug is totally cancerous and Huggins totally doesn't deserve to publish it anymore we all agree on that and us being here now talking about it that's the solution we want to make everyone aware not start a war we can do better than check on yourself Barbie cuttin the words like daggers allowing him to perform hates on people who don't deserve it is hate and here was where it all came down the stranger could tell by the body language of the group the way they shifted quietly and uncomfortably in their boots the intensity in toxie's voice this growing silence here and now was where they recognized the weirdness of the one they called Domino someone was finally going to agree that she did talk kind of funny and maybe this was all a bit too much and perhaps five minutes from now there would be an unmasking how would they feel to know they'd all been chanting along with an atomic on how would it feel to look in a mirror and see everything there was to hate in themselves he held his breath the way you do when cresting the peak on a roller coaster but the drop never came don't you dare try to stop us stopping hatred Lance he said slowly moving closer to Barbie and raising his shield in toxie's direction yeah said kitty joining in her other side be with us or against us but this in the middle thing not gonna cut it any more tuck seized head swiveled between the three of them unsure where to look everything seemed to be closing in on her she became a foreign body in the artery of topler street surrounded by a system that had just gone autoimmune she backed away into the crowd vanishing before things could get much worse for her nobody could see the pain in her face beneath the gas masks but that doesn't mean it wasn't there no more hugs was all Barbie said it was all she needed to say now what had once been no more than a dozen people with the phrase don't hug me and the trolla fight Tom Huggins on their signs had in the space of several minutes coagulated into a street spanning clot of a hundred or more and who knows how it happened so quickly but most of their signs had already been changed or replaced with new ones that read no more hugs instead the stencils of the man now had red X's of their eyes or a large red circle around his face with a bar running through it the mob swelled into the chant and was soon sweeping down topler Street like a tidal wave with a vendetta it was all the stranger could do to grab Barbies wrist at the last possible moment pull her against the flow into the safety of a nearby alleyway they didn't even seem to notice her sudden absence the wave had a mind of its own sentient and hungry what the stranger wheezed out of breath did you just do Barbie shrugged staring at the passing mob with an eerily vacant expression some of them were lighting torches now the orange glow reflected in the studs of her mask the old polished wood of her skin spoke oppression our key is symptomatic of hate making hatred ists with or against I cannot believe it I can't believe that is what set them off you're not even doing a good impression he snatched the mask off her face a new wall had formed on that side of the alley one made of angry masked busca nights the stranger wanted to peek out and see how bad things really were but didn't want to risk getting swept away a pair of undaunted foxes appeared in the alley and pushed between them toward the wall one was carrying an armful of unlit torches the other a small cardboard sign which read 10 bucks a pop they squeezed out into the chaos chittering with laughter yeah okay the stranger said taking Barbie by the bicep and turning toward the open end of the alley let's get out of here before someone bothers to notice you're missing as they made their way the mob continued to grow behind them by the time they were on the outskirt hills the city was alive busken's high reaching spires and skyscrapers so much like fists thrust toward the sky had become part of the movement Giants in the crowd the tiny torch lights of the people surged between their feet in the darkening Twilight when the stranger looked at it he saw a javelin of flickering red points forming in the streets aimed at the heart of their twin city sock there was a sinking sensation in his gut he didn't look back again act 1 interlude somewhere else a girl who calls herself the Toxic ah oh - is staring at her computer screen one hand over her mouth the website on the screen is called podium org slogan stand up and speak if you have something to say and people who want to listen this is the place for it podium will find a way to turn that attention into money and keep your ball rolling there are many shows with pages detoxic I could be looking at here all different shades of political and philosophical podcast video blog podium isn't that picky one of the few she can't be looking at however is the one before her right now the listing is still there when she opens the drop-down menu of podcasts the words bear-hug are still available in there big red blocky letters when she clicks on them 404 not found the requested URL forward slash bear-hug pod could not be found on this server but she's still refreshing it over and over because you never know maybe the server just hasn't looked hard enough really she ought to be glad 72 hours ago she would have been this is the outcome all of them have wanted after all no more platform no more Huggins laughing with all his cronies at her expense she'll never have to hear his voice again reducing her ideals and her efforts to punchlines today in idiocy is gone maybe forever that's a good thing isn't it so why is she sitting here now tapping f5 on repeat wishing it would come back in her head she sees the change as a matter of hash tanks hash tag don't hug me had been a modest little thing mostly people she knew giving voice to the problem of the podcast it was where she had met X kitty got claws X and landsea lot which was felt without grammar so that most people read land clot rather than the intended pun and maybe Kitty could be a little overzealous at times Lancey a little too protective but they were good people people like her unafraid to stand up for the things that needed standing up for even if their discussions and their social media threads never went anywhere never changed a thing it felt good right just to express their ideals publicly where people could see and maybe latch on if they felt the same hashtag no more hugs had changed all of that even now she finds the whole thing mystifying in the space of 24 hours the entire movement had gone from public demonstration to rallying cry someone who called herself Domino emphasis on the no had shown up out of nowhere slinging the strangest rhetoric detoxic a-- had ever seen her ideas were all half-formed grammar on par with a second language child response is so detached she might as well have been speaking to herself most of the time she sounded like an alien doing its best impression of what it thought humans sounded like when they're allowed to use social media and yet even with all of her strangeness even with her newness to the movement she managed to weaponize all the docile don't hug bees into violent no more huggers in less than a day the new hashtag caught like wildfire and soon even Kitty and Lance II were storming the podium site in all its fan sites more than 200,000 negative reviews and 3,000 dollars in lost subscriptions later the site had no qualms with erasing Tom and all his affiliations with the platform so Huggins was solved and everyone was very happy with that but it's not right it doesn't feel right people are supposed to decide whether they're going to change their mind not be coerced into it by an overwhelming threat she knows that and she thought she'd surrounded herself with others who knew it as well refresh refresh refresh it's not that she wants the site to come back really it's that she wants it all to be undone the attack the realization that so many people want to attack the realization that Lance Ian kiddie are among them the realisation that their hatred is not only more intense than that of Tom and his cronies but maybe even more dangerous refresh refresh refresh if the site would just come back maybe that would mean things aren't so bad after all maybe then it would just be a lot of frustrated people lashing out harmlessly rather than a mob swarming to destroy something maybe then she wouldn't feel so ashamed refresh refresh refresh act to the city of dark stairs if the old city on the coast had been a black and white film and buskin had been a modern effect late in blockbusting bonanza then sock was a piece of art house realism the kind of dystopian cinema so bent on exposing the world's gritty underbelly that applies straight pasts documentary and into the land of lurid hyperbole where there could have been clouds there was a smear of Browns sepia haze where there could have been buildings there were clusters of dilapidated brick and steel every crevice was caked with something black in every wall tattooed with graffiti less a city more a malignant urban growth all of this barbae was perfectly content not to notice she looked out through the eyes of the sagging rubber cat mask the stranger had given her searching for the sources of sounds it jiggled with the motion of her head as she creamed to catch the few wisps of conversation that came floating her way there were people here easily as many as in buskin but not a soul among them in a crowd the effort not to touch not to hear or be heard not to be noticed in any way was palpable there were pedestrians who squeezed themselves against the grimy walls as they walked as if high up on a ledge there were folk who vanished into the dangerously yawning black spaces between buildings there was even a fair amount of traffic across the jagged and treacherous roof scape above all to avoid the mainstream of traffic now and then Barbie would hear a passerby mutters something under their breath and she would stop in the middle of the street wheel around and stare in their direction like a household pet who's heard a ghost and to her that's all they turned out to be nothing people with voices too quiet to make them real good thing too it made the stranger's job shepherding her miles easier than it had been in buskin he hated both cities for different reasons but if there was one thing he credited this one for above the other it was the relative quiet maybe their masks were uglier monsters and ghouls and absurdist caricatures that meant nothing if you weren't in on the joke maybe any one of them would stab you in the back if it made them feel better maybe everyone in buskin was right to call these people spook but at least there was no pageantry no grand displays here no sir no-one would tolerate that kind of thing as the stranger basked in the lack of demonstrations the two of them passed by something on a brick wall which with some effort of the imagination could have possibly been a painted mural Foxx's was here it tried to say in big red misspelled words over a splattering of black and white a small pack of foxes stood before it wielding paint cans in brushes lashed to long poles the city was lousy with the little troublemakers scurrying all over and their white masks and pointed snouts here they were just part of the ecosystem more native pests than genuine provocateurs every now and then they managed to do something terrible and poignant but mostly it was petty graffiti or vandalism these five or six were busy fixing the mural which meant changing the misspelling from FA W que es es to f ax es the ongoing struggle to get it right was visible in the faded bones of countless over written letters beneath so close this time maybe the next brunch would get it down this stranger wasn't competent in that but he smiled anyway unlike in buskin where he'd been on the prowl for a place to put barbae to work he knew his mark before he ever set foot in buskin the only thing that made it difficult was the fact that he was looking for a bar and looking for a particular bar in sauk was like looking for a particular shred of hay in a haystack they passed dive after grimy dive lined up on either side of the streets in a never-ending parade of inebriation they were all pretty much the same routine dim lights loud music news trying to be heard from a radio somewhere in the room if the regulars didn't recognize you they would glare with the force which could physically push you back out the door if you had the misfortune to inhale you'd taken the cumulative result of several million cigarettes a rainforest do cover of armpit sweat and the alcohol flavored Omni burp which permeated the very soul of the establishment each of them was over brimming with luxuries of this variety but only one had the distinction of hosting the strangers query Tom Huggins after a lot of looking and a lot of disgruntled patrons looking back they finally came to the place and was called the smiling toad its namesake had been painted on the old wood of the door the bust of a toad one pensive green human hand on its chin it smiled at the stranger as he approached as if it knew something he'd rather it didn't he put one of his big hands on its face and pushed it out of the way inside the bar was identical to all the others or it would have been if there wasn't a crowd gathered near the counter a rare example of flocking spooks all staring out of their unpleasant masks at the same thing before the bar backlit conveniently by the lights in a way which darkened his features sat the hulking shape of the man himself through the cigarette gloom it would have been easy to mistake his face for a particularly grisly mask he had a jaw like a shovel full of crooked teeth complexion just cleaner than a lepers the tiny slivers of his eyes glistened from the center of his face with reptilian astuteness to barbae he was exactly as the signs in buskin had stenciled him every bit the troll the only thing that don't hug knees had missed with their signs was the cigar hanging from the corner of his mouth too big to be a cigar actually it was what he called a Churchill all of this probably amounted to something pretty imposing although it didn't occur to Barb a dated just then in fact until he opened his mouth again nothing in particular occurred to her at all it did however occur to the stranger he felt himself shrink back behind the otamatone as they crossed the bar it wasn't the way the man looked that did it he'd seen Tom before in a place where things have the decency to look more or less like what they really are Huggins may not have been the pinnacle of human beauty but he wasn't the monster barbae was seeing either at least he didn't look like it no it wasn't Huggins himself that had the stranger cowering in his robe it was the state that Huggins was in and how livid the entire room seemed to be over it there was a radio on the bar counter chattering about the no more hugs mob pouring out praise for their bravery fearless folk who came together for the greater good they called it wheeze doubt an incredulous laugh and clicked the dial off brave he looked at the crowd is that what we're calling it brave for a thousand people to do this to one guy he gestured at himself with a sweeping motion meaning his two black eyes the bandage around his head the cast on his leg someone behind the counter blew a raspberry inside of his mask which was a very wet mistake he didn't acknowledge it his mask made him look like he was wearing a jack-o'-lantern except instead of a pumpkin the features were somehow carved into a head of dripping golden-brown turkey gravy his voice was like oil if oil could have a lisp I mean how you gotta do to be brave over there it's out really they'll think you're their return Messiah or something that smoke culture for you said Tom one of them gets it in their head that a lynch mob is justice and suddenly you've got bruises all over in a burned town office just for like lemmings hey we got your bath right nark gravy looked at the other person behind the bar who is a small fellow in a black horned Knights helmet the helmet was a bit on the large side and bobbled around on his head as he nodded he got run of our place while you're out of a studio gravy went on and honestly I'm thinking it'll do you some good someone like Domino tries to come around here he shook his head and dragged a finger across his soupy throat sounds about right said Huggins taking the stump of his Churchill from his mouth he appraised it with mock interest like somebody pretending to look at their watch I can tell you're ready to show some teeth I mean she's already here after all isn't she huh this stranger had slowly been piloting Barbie into the crown to get her near the action he froze staring out of the side of his mask at the big troll Huggins was looking sideways in his direction was that it then had they figured him out before he'd done anything he'd known they'd be more skeptical than the busca Knights if you weren't one of them if you didn't think in the precise way that they did they'd find a fault with you before too long and eject you from their little bubble of hatred he knew from experience he was actually counting on it happening to Barbie but not yet not before they fell for her even worse than the whole thing failing did Huggins know what he'd done in buskin what Barbie had caused visions of what a room full of angry spooks might do to somebody like him shuddered through his mind he felt his muscles go steely is Tom raised the Churchill but toward the two of them felt the heat rush into his face as if the burning tip were only inches away Tom flicked the stump at them and everyone turned to watch it sail through the air and hit barb a between the eyes that is the picture of Barbie the one pinned to the wall just who are left in it she was wearing the Domino mask there were tiny holes peppered through the photograph throwing darts sprouting out of her eyes and mouth the cigar stump left a tiny sip mark where it struck and then tumbled down like a pachinko ball between the darts it's a good look for her he said reclining against the bar two small spooks materialized from the gloom surrounding Huggins one with a new churchill the other with a match to lighted it was an automatic process just something that happened he didn't even seem to realize continuing to smoke as if the new cigar had been in his mouth all along but listen I gotta tell you boys he went on that there that's Mook thinking they're the ones who get all up in arms over one person saying one thing they're the ones who shut you up believe me I like her just as much as you do but forget about Domino she's just the loudest voice in the room the stranger stopped holding his breath he'd been gripping Barbies shoulders so hard there were big shallow depressions in the polished wood where his fingers had been she didn't notice or care all of her attention was wrapped up in the first real conversation she'd heard since they'd arrived in the city she stared with her painted eyes as huggens gravy and narc made the slow metamorphosis a word by word from indistinct mask-wearing things into people real problem said Huggins is that this happens at all it's bigger than one person coming along and stirring the pot they're building a culture of suppression over there been doing it for years and it's okay because they call it justice at this point they can do almost whatever they want long as they're righteous enough about it Bancha Cox gravy scuffed like having actual textbook definition Cox well actually said nark raising a small black gauntleted finger according to the dictionary definition of the word cuckold they would have been kuck if they didn't do any job it's a figure of speech gravy snapped that's missing the point said Huggins doesn't matter what you call them mopes lemmings cuckolds point is all I did was speak my piece all any of us do when I ask you did that become a punishable offence well said Newark punishable by whom really just about anything can be a punishable offense given the right now you know what it is gravy cut in its frontier justice is what it is anything turds punishable when he got enough people with pitchforks in one place Huggins pointed in assenting finger at gravy well that's just great isn't it it's punishable not because there's some law or mandate we can all agree on that justifies the whole bloody thing it's punishable because they literally have the ability the numbers to punish us for it Huggins took a long drag the tip of his Church Hill glowed in the light like a single red eye when he spoke again it was through a fresh cloud of smoke crying shame how many people in this world would rather snuff out the truth and face up to it no gravy whined in the nasal voice cuz the truth makes them feel bad and God forbid anyone has to feel bad he's scoffed mooks and then quieter cogs narc raised a finger in protest but met ice with gravy before the words came out and thought better of it here's some truthful Emma said Huggins they are deluded the truth is all there is and they never stop fighting it if you're gonna be a mindless zealot pickin up every cause that comes your way you better expect the onlookers to see a living if you roll over every time somebody tells you they have feelings you have no right to be surprised when somebody points out the fact that you're a and if you're gonna let other people make up your mind for you be their little attack dog why is it a surprise that we're calling your MOOC the truth isn't always sunshine and rainbows but it never hurt anybody least he said rubbing one of his bruised eyes not the way lies do kinda makes you wanna shut up and shout all at the same time you know save gravy he held up his hands like a pair of scales cuz on the one hand you never know who's listening and if they're gonna think you deserve a lynch mob on the other hand screw that you gotta be able to speak the goddamn truth even when it's not fluffy bubbly nice stuff ding when barbason visible egg-timer textbooks oppressor culture she offered out of nowhere the room fell silent all eyes turned to Barbie in her rumpled ill-fitting cat mask the features were done in ink but so sloppily that they only managed to look like a preschoolers kranj drawing it had an eyebrow raised in the naya-a lowered which the stranger hoped gave it a nice skeptical expression you what said gravy after a moment to the stranger surprised bar bass kofta gravy in almost the exact way he'd been scoffing about moocs she squeezed into the circle of big Tom's light sat on one of the empty barstools beside him and said - gravy seriously it's a textbook obvious allottee obviously mooks used the PolitiFact ik of not allowing freedom through pushing their lemmings suppressor culture agenda what part of that don't you get more silence narc was trembling he looked like he was about to explode with all the pent-up Corrections barbae deserved but gravy clapped a hand over his helmeted mouth before it could happen ah he said with a sideways glance at Barbie you ok there friend you got all your marbles she scuffed again and then again said obviously you a Mook their friend got all your feelings they stared at each other from across the bar faces inscrutable beneath their masks the stranger can nearly taste the tension in the air as palpable as the sweat and the beer and smoke the room was a pack of wolves ready to pounce this was the way with spooks too gentle and they'll never even realize you exist too aggressive and they'll gut you where you stand he'd seen it happen a dozen times an entire second past in silence then two then three and then huggens burst out laughing it was a deep thunderous sound which seemed to shake the foundations of the bar itself the stump of the new Churchill fell from his gaping mouth and onto the bar counter gravy narc and the rest immediately cowered at the sound beta Wolf's before their alpha gravy even made a feeble attempt to join in but it sounded thin in fragile talk about car colds Huggins roared shaking gravy by the scruff of his neck the way you would a feisty puppy he looked in at gravy through the eye holes of his mask are you a Mook you wanna crucify her just cuz she shows up and uses some big words you don't understand Mook thinking he held eye contact with gravy for a long moment a way for them to say to each other do you understand and yes without the rest of the room hearing he nodded a few times and gave gravy a very masculine thump on the bank look he went on it's not how I choose to put it but the whole suppressive culture thing that's what I've been getting at this is us he said pointing at the smoldering butt of his Churchill on the bar counter ugly little piece of burnin truth and this he paused to search for something settled on narcs mug through the contents over his shoulder and incidentally onto the audience behind who didn't seem to mind and thumped the empty glass down beside the bunt this is them empty vessel ready to suck up whatever stupidity comes their way now we're harmless we keep to ourselves but how are we supposed to help it if the truth he waved a hand back and forth through the ribbon smoke rising off the Churchill stump gets out there who can blame us for that the nature of publishing but see he said slowly picking up the cup and turning it upside down the mooks they aren't just offended oh no they're empty blank define themselves by what they don't want us to say or do with a note of finality he placed the upended cup down over the cigarette but the smoke began to fill it up hiding the Churchill stump in a milky white haze Huggins folded his arms looked around at the other spooks their entire culture is fear disallowance suppression mooks oppressive culture barbed a repeated Huggins snorted I'd call it censorship society but sure if you like suppressive culture the stranger was still in the larger crowd outside the halo of Huggins light all around him he heard a cricket chorus of hush dissents in acknowledgments saw heads nodding in shoulders shrugging he observed in Oz a room full of monsters ghouls assorted spooks of every description digested his translation of bar Bayes algorithmically generated gibberish he was too impressed to be giddy he expected them to be a harder sell than this for a moment there it had looked like they wouldn't be sold on barbae at all spooky can't mask er no according to the plebeian lemming logic of mooks we are in oppression urkki because that makes sense said barb a shrugging dramatically at her new audience this stranger made him involuntary snort and moved to cover his mouth no one heard because they were too busy chuckling actually chuckling without any worldly clue what she was or what it was that they were agreeing with that even mean anything narc said gravy of oppression Archy the little knight sputtered overwhelmed just to be noticed ah no I mean not strictly it seems made up maybe a portmanteau of oppression and just when I expected from a bunch of mooks gravy interrupted picking up whatever phrase is thrown at him and sticking it on as many banners as possible they don't even care if it means anything long as it gives them something to shout about well that's it exactly oppression our key has got to be one of the most incredible things that's ever come out of buskin think about it between that and the irony of using the phrase no more hugs in defense of kindness I could probably write a pretty good today in idiocy about this little thing that is if I still had an office said Huggins I hear you boss what's the plan on that anyway like you want to get a new place get bear hunk back up and running you know we're gonna support you but what I'm trying to figure out is what will stop him from burning that down to no offense but you're already pretty beaten up they'll know how you two fare a second time look said barb a placing her hands on the bar counter like a pair of cleavers it's obvious that the only way to make a freedom is the imp unification of our truth speech gnarrk pinched the bridge of his nose between his two big helmet like he was just barely keeping his head from splitting open by holding on to that one tender spot gravy on the other hand perked up he looked from barbados than back so you mean like we should be able to say whatever we feel like without being afraid we'll get mobbed right not how I choose to put it but if you like not even hearing the way she just parried it Huggins gravy bobbed his head up and down and began to drum his fingertips excitedly against the bar yeah okay that's what I've been saying it's just the truth about our opinions right doesn't leave a matter of we're saying that we think they deserve to die we should be able to say it no holds barred no fear matchstick spook and Churchill spook appeared once more to restock Tom's empty mouth that he said through a fresh cloud it is our biggest problem it's not a question of what we're allowed to do but what they're allowed to do the offices like the one I used to be a part of will always just let them waltz in and burn the place down no thought security or protection why because it's easier to be rid of me and then it is to fight an army that ain't gonna change anytime soon it's not at 2:00 Bayesian of sopressa culture of validity said Barbie leaning back on her stool and tilting her head at Huggins in a perfect picture of incredulity it's a just a position of frontier justice enforcement against buskin is something we shouldn't be afraid to be ok weird cat person whoever you are you're really growing on me look said gravy turning to Tom and the rest of the bar if they're just gonna do whatever they want to us why are we doing anything back like we're afraid to speak the truth no they should be afraid to get in the way of it a flagrant abuse Elodie said barb a there was a scream from behind the bar gnarrk was holding the horns of his helmet as if pulling his own hair he scrambled up onto the counter and stabbed a finger at barb a it isn't it isn't in obvious allottee he made air quotes with his gauntlets because that doesn't mean anything neither does de Bayesian air quote suppressive culture Erik quote and least of all oppression are key air quote it's all it's he struggled to find the words impressioned nonsense she is just as bad as domino and if you really start retaliating just because she shows up and starts talking a bunch of exciting nonsense at you you might as well be a Mook finally the stranger leaned forward watching the moment unfold maybe they couldn't see it in busking maybe they were too blinded by their passion but here in stock or cynicism reigns of course one of them was bound to catch on eventually and against all odds it hadn't been Huggins the big bear himself arbiter of the obscene protector of the profane was so wrapped up in this stranger in her weird cat mask he had even started to take cues from her what would everyone say when they realized she was a machine that they could be so stirred by pure gibberish what would happen to this bar full of supplicating spooks if the stranger had been sitting on a seat he would have been at the edge of it instead he clenched his fists inside his robe to keep them from shooting triumphantly into the air he watched and waited for them to turn on her and that themselves seconds ticked by like an eternity but no one rounded on her no one made a move to tear off her mask instead Huggins slapped his big hands together and then again and again until the whole room was delivering an emotionless applause gnarrk shrunk a little unsure what to make of the reception no that was good said Huggins really thanks for sharing your feelings with us is there anything else you want to get out while you're up there maybe we can get you a picket signs away and an army to march with would you like that uh hi she narc tried to say he searched the room for any sign of empathy any inkling of understanding when he found none he slinked down off the counter and hid so that only his horns were visible from behind the bar as long as we're here and talking through things peacefully not shouting said Huggins with the pointed glance at the disembodied horns we're nothing like them but you know narc you're right about one thing fighting back is Mook thinking that's the difference between us and them the big one they're followers we aren't right boys he said to the room in general there was a cheer of assent but we aren't a bunch of either those mooks deserve justice sure and if they keep this up you can bet it'll come to them but it won't come from us because there is no us it'll come from individuals fed up with this suppressive culture thing meanwhile we just keep speaking the truth however we can the truth never hurt anybody after all ain't on us if a couple people out there get fed up and give those mooks what's coming to them is it and what would that be exactly gravy's voice was low conspiratorial a hush fell over the bar as Huggins considered this a congregation before their prophet he took a deep poll on his church Hill and there was the red eye again staring through the gloom through these there needs to be an unmasking safe to be part of a lynch mob when nobody knows it's you but would they be so bold if the masses could hold them accountable for their violence would they still fight if they were as vulnerable as I am he concluded with the rhetorical shrug obviously Barbie confirmed meaning the opposite something dawned on gravy then he looked at Huggins than at the door then back at Huggins yeah yeah I see that's real interesting awkwardly his body began to gravitate toward the exit now I have to I cannot eat ate on that one yeah but uh kind of a late night for me I got stuff to do so uh yeah I'm out didn't get you guys hope you figure something out about the new office and all just a matter of time said Huggins he didn't look at gravy but there was something that could have almost been a smile on his mouth as he said someone will do the right thing eventually put them in their place no business of mine though it'll happen when it happens gravy was already halfway out the door when he said well here's hoping whatever happens happens soon anyway good night guys see you tomorrow he interrupted himself with a low curse one of the straps of his backpack had caught on the doorknob and yanked it off his back spilling the contents out onto the floor in cast a glance around the bar to see whether anyone was watching but they had already lapsed back into the never-ending cycle of their conversation he let out a relieved breath stuffed everything back into the bag and was gone the next moment only the stranger hidden in the shadow of his hood had seen the Fox mask as it fell out of gravy's backpack act 2 interlude somewhere else a boy who calls himself narc di't is staring at his phone thumb moving frantically against the screen names and profile pictures wheel by too fast to read or not name's not profile pictures but placeholders for the ones that ought to be there an army of identical vaguely humanoid silhouettes marching across the screen trailing a banner of this account no longer exists maybe one in twenty is still a distinct person with an identity but even then their profiles are no longer theirs painted over with the trauma of exposure one of the survivors has penned an image of the smashed in front door of their apartment to their profile the result of a misguided raid by police forces informed of a fictitious hostage situation at that address another has a screenshot of an email pinned there explaining in no uncertain terms why they don't need to come into work tomorrow or ever again there are death threats and acts of vandalism and pornography of a particularly vengeful variety and on and on what had once been a feed of hashtag no more honks at hashtag don't hug me posts has spiraled into an obituary of digital selves more than a hundred thousand bodies deep and nark with trembling hands feels himself at the bottom of it close that window or no his thumb lingers there for a moment doesn't close minimizes and then navigates its way over to his Internet Relay Chat the smiling toad it's called nothing fancy white windows and green borders they never bothered to gussy it up beyond the default theme the only indicator you're even in the right chat are the name the ever grinning image of the cartoon toad in the top right and the familiar list of active users at the top of the list under the word admins other user names gnarrk underscored it-- 69 gravy gassed 96 and as of less than a week ago Tom bear Huggins he thumbs Tom's username but pauses before the touch can register is Tom really the person he needs to talk to what would Tom even do celebrate probably awkwardly he maneuvers his thumb away from Tom's name and on to gravies a new window blossoms open full of private exchanges that goes so far back they predate the creation of the toad itself he tries and deletes several attempts to start the conversation gravy must already be there watching the little typing animation at the bottom of the window because before NART can get anything out new text dings into existence 69 gravy gas 296 sup typing typing about 30 more seconds of typing narc tight hey is there any chance you happen to have an idea of who doc stall those people gravy little yellow emoji face an eyebrow raised hand rubbing its chin doxxed more like unmasked LOL what how isn't it doc Singh I mean by every possible definition reputable or not releasing the names addresses phone numbers emails and workplaces of those people was absolutely in arguably doxxing nah lol they let all that info go on their own when they signed up for podium to roast Tom I'll someone would have to do is get at that database in boom their fault honestly narc dot dot dot is that seriously all you have to say for yourself you realize you put a truly unprecedented number of people in harm's way right never said I did it did I knock if you're not going to use any grammar or punctuation can you at least spell my name right you know having people call me narc without the K in front makes me feel like a snitch are you I haven't rented you out yet have I and three ever said it with me Shrek emoji gravy come on we didn't start this chat to organize attacks on innocent people it was just supposed to be a nice safe place for us to actually speak our minds yep goddamn hidey hole whipty-doo you seriously want to spend all your time in here like stay scared ever post anything honest anywhere on the internet ever again well obviously not but you're drawing up a false dilemma here it's not shut up or knuckle up gravy you don't have to be violent to have your way lol yeah okay tell them that you know a skeptic at and Tom where right now Domino and all them are gonna think twice before pulling something like that again aren't they narc dot dot dot so is this how we're doing things now internet trench warfare yeah be much lol well what if I don't like that what if I miss just talking about things what if I decide to try and keep someone from doing something like this again lmao okay gnarrk one IDC do what you want I never said it with me to won't matter it's like tom says no matter what you do somebody's gonna get fed up and do something sooner or later three I know who you are Andre Cervantes male 19 Vermillion South Dakota USA you think I didn't the phone falls from narcs hands and lands like a knuckle blow between his eyes he's too shocked to do anything but blink was that a threat after all their time building the toad together painstakingly carving out one single space on the internet for people to speak their minds without fear is gravy really holding him at info point the thought doesn't make sense he tries to grasp it in his hand but the irony makes it slick in den fibia s-- and it keeps wriggling away from him the whole point of the toad of bear hug of his friendship with gravy was supposed to be that they weren't like all those people in hashtag no more hugs the truth was just the truth you speak it but it's never supposed to hurt anyone that's what Tom always says isn't it so why act 3 the city of lost things the old city was the only one watching when like a pair of soldiers dishonorably discharged the two of them came slinking back it wasn't a judgmental gaze but it was familiar in a way the stranger didn't like welcome back it seemed to say to the place of things abandoned and unwanted welcome home their old footprints were still there in the sand untouched the booth was waiting for them door wide open this was the third time he'd made the trip the second with Barbie in tow the first time he had brought her back had been a simple matter of course a cleansing of the palate between buskin and sock this was something else furious final deliberate with one big hand cuffed around her tiny wrists he dragged her out of the surf up the beach back to the booth and stuffed her inside he meant to slam the door shut but forgot he'd broken the latch and it came back open with a pathetic creak he looked at the door as if it knew what it had done wrong wanted to throttle the cheeky piece of wood instead exercising perhaps more strength of will than he ever had in his life he delicately eased the door into its frame seated the loose bolt and it's bent latch barbae settled back into place with the mechanical precision of a key in a lock in one rigid motion she plucked the tragedy and comedy masks from their hooks turned to face the shattered window and fell back into the still portrait of a circus damsel deciding which to where the stranger stared at her for a moment and scoffed the girl in the portrait had acquired an article of clothing you could almost mistake for a rubber cat mask which sank to dejectedly off her face rather destroying the whole effect he reached through the broken pane tore it away flung it into the ocean and then tried again this time when he looked at her something happened a shift assorting without consulting him he found his brain had taken the image of tools decaying on a neglected workbench locked it away in a tackle box and hidden it in some dark cobwebbed corner of his mind he could no longer seem to see the weathered pale wood of her skin the rusting joints between all he could see was her painted makeup Carvin chestnut curls the slender grace of her figure and face looming there and his huge cloak grotesque red skull grinning from the cowl like a devil out of hell she was the opposite of a mere to him a reflection of every lovely thing he lacked he punched the admit one button with his thumb the out of tune circus Calliope began to wheeze its way out of the hidden speakers the automated message out of Barbie's math welcome what one and up know shove it hew useless thing the music stopped Barbie stopped she stared at him with her soulless smile you want to listen to something fine listen to this he gripped the window frame hard enough to shake the whole booth leaned in close whoever made you I get why they left you here to rot you're a mistake a walking malfunction I'm probably the last person who'll ever take the time to track you down and God knows it wasn't worth it one broad burlesque more like one bond he searched for something that both started with a bee and meant troublemaker but found nothing he wouldn't think of one Dame demagogue for several more weeks but by then it would be far too late for a proper jab they were only supposed to buy your act for a second one single second where was the part where they step back and go wow do I really sound that stupid because that's what you're supposed to make them do not go oh yeah you know you're right weird robot with bad grammar I am a genius they were supposed to see what they're really like for just one moment and maybe just maybe they'd be ashamed of it God it could have been so good you know I think you made them even worse if that's possible I mean they were obnoxious before but at least they weren't lynch mobs and vigilantes he slipped a hand beneath his mask and rubbed at his face you know what the weirdest thing is though they loved you they really did or at least they listened to you when you said stuff he didn't want to look at her anymore frozen there in the window smiling her indifferent smile he turned toward the beach and began to pace back and forth kicking up clumps of wet sand doesn't make any sense if some random stranger came up to me and part out that nonsense that you do that might be curious for a second but after that I get annoyed and tell them to piss off I don't know how you fumbling idiot robot are more worth their time than me none of them ever paid that much attention to anything I ever said to them and I'm an actual person with actual legitimate stuff to talk about real challenging conversations worth having you waltz up found out a bunch of gibberish and they praise your name but me nope no sir no crowd for me kick me out of the bar doesn't make any goddamn sense he said emphasizing the word God with a kick that sent a tiny shower of sand into the sea he collapsed onto the beach and sat there as if he were a big black Boulder washed in by the tide he might as well have been for all the good talking was doing him he didn't know if the words were meant for barbae or for himself or the twin skylines of buskin and sock out there on the horizon he stared at them for a long time before he said anything else the fist liked hours of busking and all the righteous uniformity the malignant urban mass of sock bunch of MOOCs and spooks he tasted the words in his mouth and frowned no that's not enough you put on a show like you're different from each other but really you're all the same mouth-breathing hivemind self-righteous do whatever makes me feel like I'm right normies with the way you act I'd be surprised if there are even people under those masks the words were pouring out of him now a sour morass and his gut that his body needed to be rid of you're not people your mindless faithless feeble creatures with no thought in the world except to protect yourselves if you could see what you're actually like for one second one single second you'd be disgusted you'd hate yourselves as much as I do and then some but you don't have to worry about that do you you wouldn't even know if you are looking at yourself hell you didn't this time what kind of self-respecting intelligent person doesn't even know their own reflection when they see it no kind that's who here no kind of people this went on and on spiraling ever deeper into the pit of his hatred now on his knees now on his hands and knees now punching the sand with each syllable voice breaking in a way that wasn't at all becoming of his red skull's grin minutes past in the form of unpunctual his voice was beginning to grow horse with the exertion although he didn't realize it he was in the middle of making an ethical case against the two cities trying to convince them of how toxic their very existence was to people like him on the diatribe cut in his throat there was a hand on his shoulder you're right you know about everything barbae was standing beside him there were fresh tracks in the sand leading from her booth he hadn't heard the door come open hadn't seen the masks go back on their hooks hadn't noticed the life returned to her the ratcheting had gone out of her voice again she stared down at him with her brown painted eyes face a mask of pity no not pity worse than that he recognized the expression it was the one mothers give their children when they have a boo-boo in need of a kiss he jerked his shoulder out from beneath her hand excuse you I'm having a conversation here Oh who with the stranger looked from Barb eight the twin skylines and then back not you he sent more sheepishly than he would have liked barb a shifted backward brows vaulted so what you'd rather talk to the ocean than to me Wow he sent idly beating the sand from the knees of his robe as he came to his feet see you're an otamatone worse you're one made particularly to talk a lot of nonsense he gestured toward the one broad burlesque moniker atop her booth so sure I'll talk at you I'll do that all day but to you that's another story nothing you can say we'll be of use to me so why would I want to hear it Barbies brows fell like guillotines her mouth hung open because I can think and feel and I have things to say that matter you asked a wave of heat washed over the stranger's face and neck he stared dumbly at her for several long seconds not knowing what to say he hadn't realized the machinery of her face was capable of producing this depth of emotion hadn't known her voice could inflict this way weren't you just delivering a speech about how bad it is that they wouldn't even listen to the things you had to say that they couldn't even stop to look at themselves see how they're behaving if you can't even pay me the decency to hear me when I'm trying to comfort you what makes you any better than they are hey he snapped don't you compare me to them I'm just being sensible here I mean you weren't half this well-spoken is Domino or skeptic ad or even when and got you going about that conspiracy stuff forever ago how was I supposed to know there was more going on underneath it you have to admit you really look like a busted machine hmm I bet and when they look at you I'm sure all they see is a very reasonable like-minded fellow human someone they would just love to know better a photo album of every mask he'd ever tried on fluttered through his mind coming to rest at last on the red skull hanging in the black hell he saw himself there on the beach and decided that no he probably wouldn't approach himself if given the choice he probably wouldn't have approached any of the selves he'd been ok Touche but I don't want that anymore so this suits me fine my point is said Barbie holding up her hands in a way that meant stop talking at me and start talking to me you don't know me and you haven't been trying to know me I understand that you have some impressions based on what you saw in buskin and sock but can you blame me you had me trying to act like them of course I was going to come off stilted weird disingenuous that's what they're like he recalled what it had been like to read the conspiracy theorist script to her that wrongness in the soul had she felt the same repeating those sentiments back had she felt like this the whole time beneath every mask he'd forced her to wear he squinted at her through the eye holes of his own as if he might be able to see through her if he just looked hard enough there's a lot more going on in there than it looks like huh he said Barbie shrugged and pointed a lazy finger at him more than what's going on in there at least her right tone caught him off guard then again almost every tiny expression of her strange humanity did that he tried to keep it down to a snort but the laughter was unstoppable I guess I can't argue with that he said when his breath returned sorry I just you're a robot I never expected you to be in a position to make proper jabs like that at least not at me you're kind of special huh that's a way to put it assuming you really do want to know she said looking at him severely out of the corner of her eye it's more like I'm different but the same I only have two real edges over you people experience and retention I can recall anything I'd like at the drop of a hat no brain fog no memory lapse and I have a lot to recall how do you mean I may be a little rusty but this isn't my first circus act not by a long shot I was hot stuff back when this place was still kicking she said twirling and dreamy hand in the direction of the old city the wreckage of the boardwalk carnival the motion almost looked as if it was meant to brush the gray away people tried all kinds of things with me if you can think of it that's what they did so I've been around the block done more than my share of impressions you must know a thing or two about people then huh in some ways yes in some ways no really it amounts to one thing she looked him in the eyes you know what that is he had a guess but shrugged instead of offering it you do actually I know you do because it's exactly what you were saying before there no kind of people was that malice in her eyes pain reading the emotion in them was like trying to read the future in a crystal ball it transfixed him made him want to understand wish that he could look out through them and see what she saw there more mechanical than I am she went on more predictable until now I thought that was just how things were they used to come to me have me do my silly stilted impressions and then blame me for the strangeness they saw reflected back to be human was to be scared of your own reflection she pressed a fingertip to his chest through the layers of fabric he could almost believe it wasn't a cool lacquered wooden surface at all but warm flesh the mysterious look in her eyes seemed to soften resolving at last into what was it gratitude you are the single member of your species who could have changed that impression and you did with you for the first time I did more than make them laugh or grimace I wasn't just an oddity or a broken tool I am mattered to them changed them it took a force of will not to continue staring at her mouth open beneath his mask for the first time in a long time cynicism was something he had to work at he crossed his arms beneath her finger changed them into crazed lunatics yeah I saw your job was to make them better not worse my job she said prodding her finger into his chest was to do my best impression of them which is exactly what I did it's not my fault that wasn't enough to make them vomit with shame what I will take credit for is giving them to do things they wouldn't otherwise have done we changed them do you get that she took handfuls of the fabric around his shoulders and tried to shake him but he was too heavy for her and she just ended up rattling herself around that's what I'm trying to tell you they couldn't see themselves in the mirror they can't tell a parody from a prophet but there's only so much they can change before they she let go of him and looked at her open hands as if they might contain the words she was looking for then gave up and threw them in the air before they change the strangers hand disappeared into the darkness of his hood to stroke his chin you mean he finally said if we push them far enough they'll have to see it like if I get you you're saying we need to get them to do something they could never justify and then he snapped his fingers no way to hide from it anymore Barbie snapped her fingers back at him or she tried to without skin it doesn't really work ding ding ding you've got it it's not that we failed before we just didn't finish those were only our first little baby steps and if you think about it it really is impressive how far we got with them the stranger did think about it it played like a movie montage in his mind embarrassingly poor tremulous shots of Barbie followed by cutaways to the cinematic new reality he was beginning to see one moment she was in buskin looking like a cheap Halloween store prop waving a cardboard sign the next she was leading an army of silhouettes through the Twilight bathed in the glow of their torches one moment she was in sauk arguing semantics with a bunch of bar flies the next she was a phantom wreath in cigarette smoke whispering into the ear of a demagogue and then the memories fell away and it was only a stream of possibilities mass fires in buskin his righteous anarchy took its toll echoing silence and suck each and every one of them too scared of each other to speak you really think we can do that his voice came out low husky as if he were an addict inquiring about some very illegal drug in a public place with your ingenuity and my irresistible charm she bat her eyelashes at him dramatically will give them what's coming to them will change the world this time he didn't have to drag her along she slipped her hand into his lead the way the gesture said well alright then he said with a small laugh I guess we're still in business ah buskin first sounds like a good time to me right well first things first you need tidying up he said guiding her back toward the booth she didn't argue with that once she was inside and ready he thumped the window frame twice and tipped his hood see you on the other side she grinned but didn't say anything else admit one the old Domino mask back on her face and out into the surf they went toward the city of raised fists the montage continued to play in his head fuelled him all the terrible things she would make them do the sides of themselves they'd be forced to show and by the time they realized what they were doing he froze a single image had intruded into the picture show only for a moment a frame still there it was cut between the self-immolating moocs and the terrified spooks a grinning red skull hanging in the cavern of a dark hood it hovered like a plague over the destroyed city skylines the earth carpeted and tortured human silhouettes below from each of the skulls - sockets there stared a glassy painted brown eye he cast a backward glance at Barbie she stared back with her soulless smile there was nothing in her carved vacantly expressive features to find no subterfuge no hidden cunning It was as if the person he'd been talking to barely a minute ago had been erased with the press of a button all he saw was the stranger reflected in the polished wood of her eyes oh he said and let go of her hand act 3 interlude somewhere else someone is staring glassy-eyed at a website very few people have ever heard of his face is read in the glow of its wallpaper had two killed in the darkness of the surrounding room beyond the drone of the laptops fen the only sound is a quiet Oh which he barely hears himself make his eyes are still scanning the chat history pupils darting back and forth like the carriage of a busy typewriter the text is all wrong changed right before his eyes what had moments ago been a life altering exchange about society and identity and forcing people to confront themselves is really just embarrassing the kind of cringe fest people take screenshots of and post on social media the kind he'd been putting others through for the last several days the bots messages are so full of typos linguistic inventions Frankenstein e'en abominations of grammar they make his passionate responses look like lines from a bad play just by responding to it earnestly he somehow become complicit in the performance he hadn't felt that way when the words were coming out of him though everything he had said everything the bots had said back that all seemed so real at the time as if for once somebody was actually listening to him agreeing with him validation of a kind he'd never before received all reduced in a moment of Revelation to a bunch of text a set of algorithms designed to find the intent behind his words and fountain it back in spectacular gibberish and for one glorious moment he had basked in it let himself be swaddled in the illusion that someone out there seemed to understand him better than he did he pulls the chain on the lamp beside him and the darkness winks out his face is no longer a red mask staring out of a black hood it's the face of a boy a little younger than 17 years old maybe there are more stress lines than someone his age should have and maybe the bags under his eyes make them look dark and brooding but right now the normal sharpness is gone his expression is softer than it's been in a long time as if there's been a winch in his mind invisible hands winding it tighter and tighter over the weeks and months and years until the strain of it appeared where you could see only now at last was it unwinding he navigates away from the bath site over into the field of tabs he still has open in his browser social media sites mostly everything connected to the hashtag no more hugs movement now a post-apocalyptic wasteland of vacated accounts in digital violence when he opens the internet relay chat client he's still in the smiling toad server now an ongoing funeral procession for a demolished platform looking through this stuff is like sifting through rubble although in search of what he doesn't know the answer just now but continues to pick his way through while the winch and his mind and whines is this what he'd wanted it wasn't why he'd gone through all the trouble to begin with coding the transcription application using it to connect the bot to the Domino and skeptic hat dummy accounts loosing it upon the two communities it was mostly meant to be a joke something for him he wanted to put them in a spot where they got to feel a little stupid a little ashamed and then have a good laugh about it but it hadn't taken all that much time for the bots to convince him he wanted more than that either and the thought scares him because it is only a bot it reads interprets reflects back what it finds and nothing more none of this was the bots doing it was all a result of what it had found in him the truth is that it would have felt good to see all of them cornered forced to confront the parts of themselves he hates so much it would have been a confirmation that he doesn't need to belong with any of them because they were always just violent self-righteous animals from the start not worth belonging with instead he'd been right on the precipice of proving that about himself maybe he already had a little more than half an hour passes before he realizes why he's picking through the devastation the revelation comes to him in the form of two usernames he's seen before one within the hash tag no more hugs feed one within the smiling toad he's looking for survivors others who recognize that something was wrong and found their way out before all of this the few who unlike him had no buried motive for the bots to unearth in the thousands there are only two someone who calls herself de toxic ah Oh - and another who calls himself narc di't the boy hesitates time passes eventually after much rubbing of the temples and much controlling of the Z he sends off a pair of emails subject line there's someone I want to introduce you to DT jhin's drama the unmasking of the drama where every respectable performance ends only don't ask the Greek playwright this time because they've never used that phrase when you get to this point in the show the performers are meant to stop pretending the audience doesn't exist they're supposed to remove their masks bow and whether an assault of flowery things a few bins of their lucky old produce if not after that they dislodge from the thespian amalgamin and scramble back off to their lowly individual lives this is what you might know under normal circumstances as a curtain call these however are not normal circumstances movements and dialogues and characters come and go but no curtain ever falls over this colossal show come back to this theater after a day a week a year after the entire performance has must' fide at the back of your mind and you'll find it still droning on different actors maybe different scenarios but always the same story buskin raging forever on arteries full of clotting masses suck still seething knife gripped close behind its back look even now big troll Huggins is mounting a new platform buoyed up by the bills and dimes of his spooks something more resilient this time made of a material harder to burn and there see the changing of the seasons for Kitty Lancie in the rest of the mulling masses signs which read check your masks now no more hugs no more the wheel of the Twin Cities was never meant to stop turning after a fashion this is the case for Barbie as well but only after a fashion if he went looking for her along the strip of coast beside the old city all you'd find now is more flotsam more debris if you paint very careful attention you might find peeling strips of red paint clinging to some of the waterlogged planks a bent and broken latch in the sand you certainly wouldn't find an old carnival themed booth with a shattered window and who absolutely wouldn't find an otamatone inside if that's what you're after look for the four pairs of footprints in the sand they should still be there undisturbed find them and follow them into the old city don't worry if they taper off where the sand stops in the streets begin you'll know where to go in fact in the strangeness of the city there will only be one obvious place to go toward the single tiny rash of color radiating through the gray like a drop of ink onto thin parchment feel your way toward it through the twisting thoroughfares between the fantastical forlorn faces of the shops and buildings it may take some doing you may have to get creative pass over the mismatched roofs into some doors and out of others if you're curious enough though you will find it a new attraction in the city the first and who knows how many uncounted years the operators will welcome you when you come and it will be an odd comfort something in their behavior their speech may be the way the small fellow keeps correcting everything you say the way the tongue girl speaks in a low unaffected tone they'll be familiar to you in a way you can't place ironically it'll be hard to know whether you know them without their masks and when they take your ticket you'll have to wonder how you even got it wasn't there a strange ticket man at the gate pace hidden in the darkness of his hood if you strain your mind you might just be able to recall then again you might not the attraction is nothing terribly spectacular really just a door with a silver curtain and a silver plate above which reads barbae the living looking glass the most remarkable thing about it when you approach for the first time will be the colors blossoming against the city's monochrome the metallic sheen of the curtain in the plate the timbre of the buildings flat facade even the tones of flesh and fabric and the operators as if this one fragment of the city is blushing at you if you decide to pass through the curtain you'll find yourself in a room except for two chairs facing each other a hand we are on a stand between them and in otamatone sitting in the chair opposite you the room will be bare sit down and you'll find your own face reflected in the mirror where her is thought to be your head on her shoulders or maybe that's all too abstract for you you do have your deficiency with ones and zeros after all fine for your sink it might be a little different it might be a little more like following a few too many suspicious links through a few too many defunct websites it might be more like a chat window with a bot on the other side who's stolen your social media avatar it might have the overall feel of a stolen piece of software free booted re skinned and put to better use whatever you see in the glowing rectangle of your world the effect would be the same the first time you ever spoke to yourself and got a reply back you might find her if you weren't looking she might see a hidden face even through its mask [Music] you and at last here we are at the end of our eons long terry pratchet series we had no idea this story would evolve into such a Byzantine piece of work when we first dreamt it up far cry from a short story it seems we've gone and put together the first ever tale foundry novella and let me tell you it was an experience not only the writing process but the concepts we investigated as well working on this thing has given me a strange new frame of reference for you humans especially within the arena of the internet if we hit our mark hopefully it did the same for you it may not be a perfect application of the whole unifying voice thing we spoke about in the first episode of the series but we made an effort if you decide to give this monolithic thing another pass see whether you can suss out one and where we chose to use light humor and more importantly why our next series is going to be about the ominous anomalous SCP foundation which a lot of you have been requesting for a good long time now it shouldn't be too long in the making free way to support the show you can also support the show by joining the tale foundry maintenance crew on patreon not only do our patrons decide the topics for each series and the prompts for our writing groups they also get to read and review our stories as we write them changing the final product a big thanks to all the members of our maintenance crew out there who helped heal foundry to be the best it can be a special thanks to all our artificers automata stand constructs arc D'Angelo Brandon steed clockwork Captain Awesome excel seus Josh Dayton Keith McDade Mego RPG grenade Vasily Herb Inca Walter House and William Maitland thank you I'm extremely excited to go lose myself in the willful darkness of the foundation but I'm also feeling a little forlorn normally this is where I'd share a letter from my mysterious correspondent with you but well I don't exactly have anything to share I sent my tale aids into the foundries great press ages ago to send and retrieve another letter as the routine goes but this time they didn't come back it's not the first time some of them have been away for an extended period but it is the first time since we discovered that there are other less friendly things out there in the facility beyond the foundry I'm beginning to worry about my correspondent maybe convincing them that I'm more than a figment of their imagination wasn't the best idea after all I suppose time will tell until then that's all for this series thanks for watching and keep making stuff up I'll see you next time bye [Music] [Applause]
