if you are so go check that out okay awesome okay so before we start here just sit tight guys let me take a couple notes here um the school wants me to take notes of how um the actual online experience the zoom calls are going so periodically i may just take some notes here okay all right so do we have any questions so far and again um if you would like to ask a question just raise your hand i'm calling you um so any questions yet okay okay okay great great okay so here's what we're gonna do um did do all of you have your your required book for this class with you perfect everyone okay you guys are making this very easy on me i love it um okay so um as you can tell this is your psychology class okay and what we're going to be working on today is from this book and this is the dialectical behavior therapy skills okay and each one of you guys have it all right and uh we're actually just gonna go through about one and a half pages of it okay because i think that it can be helpful for um for students your age okay okay all right so if everyone can get their books out okay and then we're gonna go to page let's see here where'd it go we're gonna go to page ah there we go sorry all right so if everyone can go to page 107 107 page 107. it should look it should look like this okay all right page 107. so what i'm going to do is i will just read a little bit of this to you and you guys can please um follow along or just listen it's up to you um i know people learn differently so i know for me if i if i can follow along it's it's usually better but um that's up to you so um what this is is this is a daily mindfulness a daily mindfulness um regimen okay and the reason i brought this up is because i think that um i know being a student right now especially we're doing classes online um it's a stressful time and i think it would be cool to teach you guys some skills on how to be mindfulness of your daily health um and just being productive and trying to sort through you know not just what's going on in the world right now but just school in general okay so let's just go through this we'll go through page 107 here okay so it says your daily mindfulness regimen will consist of three skills three skills okay um and by the way again raise your hand if you have any questions while we're going through this okay you guys are awesome thank you for for being kind to me and making this easy um okay so your daily mindfulness measurement regimen will consist of three skills that you've that you know okay one mindful breathing mindful breathing okay number two wise mind meditation and number three doing tasks mindfully okay so let's start with number one mindful breathing okay now i know in the world that we live in it sounds crazy to for someone to tell you just work on your breathing right but what i'm trying to tell you is is that um it can be very very helpful especially i know how stressful it is to be a student right now so um okay so here we go mindful breathing is a skill you'll learn remember to breathe mindfully you need to focus on three parts of the experience okay so number one you must count your breaths count your breaths okay that will help you focus your attention and it will also help you calm your mind when you're distracted by thoughts okay so show of hands how many people here feel like they get distracted easily yep every one of you yep me too me too so basically um counting your breaths um helps you calm your mind and not get distracted right so for me what i do and we can all do this together if you would like is i do the seven rule okay and the seven rule is breathing in for seven seconds holding it for seven seconds and then um exhaling for seven seconds okay so let's all try that okay so in for seven one more time in for seven hold for seven out okay in okay so that's what they mean by counting your breaths okay number two um you need to focus on phys on the physical experience of breathing this is accomplished by observing the rising and falling of your breath as you slowly inhale and exhale okay so let's do the seven again and basically what they're saying is you focus on the physical experience of breathing right so when you're breathing in feeling your lungs fill up okay and and i think is if you're watching me i'm going right that's the physical part okay so this time when we do the seven be weary of um the physical part of it okay so you see what i mean okay excellent you guys are doing great okay number three you need to be aware of any distracting thoughts that arise while you're breathing okay um then you need to let the thoughts float past without getting stuck on them letting go of the distraction of the distracting thoughts will allow you to refocus your attention on breathing and help you further calm yourself okay so basically that means um it can be very easy to get distracted right and when you're doing these breathing things you could start thinking of man i hope this this uh i hope this girl or boy likes me i hope my parents aren't mad at me i hope you know i can get good grades all you know all of that i hope i get a win on fall guys why did my friends um betray me on among us like you know it's it's a lot okay but basically this is saying letting go of those distracting thoughts letting them happen but then letting them go quickly without dwelling on them um we'll be able to help you focus more on your breathing okay all right so let's continue here um you guys are you guys good so far great okay you guys are seriously the best uh the best zoom call class that i've done so you guys are awesome okay here we go so you need to be aware of any distracting thoughts that arise while you're breathing oh i already read that sorry next one practice breathing mindfully for three to five minutes a day at minimum but if you want to practice it longer do it for as long as you can remember the more frequently you practice mindful skills the calmer you will feel and the more control you will have over your present moment experiences okay um so basically that is saying try to do it three to five minutes a day minimum okay so whether that's right when you wake up um when you're in the middle if you're starting to feel overwhelmed right it's saying in order for this to work properly do it three to five minutes a day minimum and then if you want to do it longer you can do it as long as you you want of course but they're saying three to five minutes minimum per day okay um do you guys feel like you can do that three to five minutes a day um okay so ashley why why do you think that you can't yeah absolutely yep get distracted attention span yes absolutely i think we all um struggle with that at some some point um but but please remember too that this isn't um this this this mindfulness regime of breathing isn't gonna come overnight right this is something that you practice okay so if you get distracted so let's say you're breathing in right and then you start thinking about a million things that's okay that's okay everyone is different right the point of this is to practice the point is to hopefully eventually everyone has different paces hopefully you can get to the point where you'll be able to calm yourself by doing these exercises so certainly um please do not feel bad if you don't get it the first time or if you feel like it doesn't work the first time okay okay you're great by the way thank you for that question that's fantastic okay so here's the deal um the next thing is about um how your daily mindfulness regimen will include doing tasks mindfully okay this might sound like a new skill to you but you've already practiced it okay so um basically this says focus and shift your attention between your thoughts feelings physical sensations and actions in order to be mindful of your present moment experience okay um so basically oh man we're we're already already like wow time has really flown sorry um i'm gonna skip this next part let's let's get to the good stuff here so here's what i want you to remember mindfulness is like a flame a flame okay like like fire okay so i want all of you guys to say that with me mindfulness is like a flame okay ready one two three mindfulness is like a flame okay one more time mindfulness is like a flame perfect good job and the reason that is is because here i'll show you let me get my notepad here okay so flame f f flame so we're spelling flame okay so flame we go mindfulness is like a flame flame f focus and shift your attention to be mindful of your present moment okay focus and shift your attention to be mindful of the present moment okay next is l okay l let go of distracting thoughts and judgments that's l okay let go of distracting thoughts and judgments okay and then we're gonna go a okay a accept here so i'm going to do this focus let go and then a is acceptance um so so far we got focus let go acceptance okay so use radical acceptance to maintain uh to remain non-judgmental okay and we've already learned that all right and then m m is mind mind okay use wise mind to make healthy decisions okay why is mine got it okay and then lastly is e e and e is effective okay do what's effective to accomplish your goals okay so again mindfulness is flame okay focus let go acceptance mind effective f l a m e flame got
