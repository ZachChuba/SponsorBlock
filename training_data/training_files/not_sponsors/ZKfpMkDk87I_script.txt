This is it, what should I say
I’ve never had this kind of feeling before It seems like it’s pink
From head to toe Fun Fun, Why are you
Being like this to me, so bold There must be something
Between you and me I’m weirdly attracted Even if I look around left and right
There is no color like you It’s all black and white bebe
It’s all the same bebe Take a step forward
And shake my bored heart Ooh bebe I’ve been
Waiting for a totally different man Please love me with the
Color that only you have my love Shake my heart up down
With sweet words Draw love with
Transparent colors my love Colorful in my heart
I want you come to me My world is colored
With your color I’m a little bit shy
To show you my feelings My uncomfortable world
Has become softer with you Anyone would laugh at 
Me being in love, so funny You are my drama
The genre is melodrama Mellow hello 
A marshmallow in mouth I only know you, my only Celeb   The perfect style I want
It feels like that’s you All right Who, other than you
Who can it be other than you, You are my Yoo-hoo The mint colored lines
That melts me It feels good even if I know it You are stuck, like a magnet
We are like S and N on a magnet Even if I look around front and back
There is no color like you It’s all black and white bebe
It’s all the same bebe Take a step forward
And shake my bored heart Ooh bebe I’ve been
Waiting for a totally different man Please love me with the
Color that only you have my love Shake my heart up down
With sweet words Draw love with
Transparent colors my love Colorful in my heart
I want you come to me Paint your love Everybody
With red lipsticks on Paint your love Everybody
Color me love It feels good
I have a good feeling All right(X5)
Show yourself to me Please love me with the
Color that only you have my love Shake my heart up down
With sweet words Draw love with
Transparent colors my love Colorful in my heart
I want you come to me
