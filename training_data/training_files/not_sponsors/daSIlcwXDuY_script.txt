[Music] bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla when Wizards of the coast first announced that historic the new non-rotating format that's coming to magic arena in the fall would be getting cards from throughout Magic's history added into the game along with that I was ecstatic I had actually lost most of my interest in arena right around the time of their releasing electric fire cats and Battlemaster into the game which coincidentally seemed to slow down the once slick client into a more sluggish experience I was disheartened by the continued signaling that the overall strategy with magic arena was to stick a vacuum cleaner in our pockets and then suck until all that came up was lint so I went and played popper on magic online and I had fun and I thought oh my goodness what if magic online outlasts magic arena hey a less-than-stellar standard didn't help either this is why formats like modern and Commander and yeah popper are so important to the larger game of magic because you need an ecosystem of more than standard and draft especially when in arenas case you don't even have real draft but a disappointing bot draft where the bots are drafting daft picks you see in paper magic when standard cools off I can grab a game of modern or spend Thursday nights playing commander and it keeps me in the magic until the new set comes out and hopefully re-energizes standard arena came out when standard was hot an arena therefore was also hot but as standard cooled there wasn't much else to do on arena and while yeah we're gonna get brawl soon but that's just standard commander with rotation hitting something like half of your arena collection is no longer gonna be playable and standard and when you consider all of this the reason I'm saying all of this is just to emphasize that well this historic format it better be good I might argue that a hot wildly enjoyable historic format is kind of critical for magic arena's long-term success and you all know me I love non-rotating formats I love playing with older cards that's why I love Commander in modern and popper and legacy etc so all of a sudden Wizards of the coast who had been saying don't ever expect modern on arena and who had flat-out said no we aren't adding old sets to arena they come right out of nowhere and start asking us hey what old cards should we program into arena for historic warm coil engine brainstorm dark confident may be Lord of Atlantis I asked no well either way look I really did kind of flip my lid with that announcement at first anyway I guess what I really liked about this announcement of older cards being added to arena in just a few mere months is that it kind of sets a precedent old cards old mechanics these are things we know we can add to arena could this lead to a modern master set in the future where we draft packs keep our cards and play them in historic might we even see things like a power cube on arena imagine a power cube on arena after all the reserve list does not even apply to arena so everything is seemingly on the table again I was elated but then I realized my elation was more over an excitement about what the announcement opened up in the realm of possibilities and less about what it meant for the reality of historic itself just what do these older extremely powerful cards being added to the game and the format mean well for the game in the format let's start with warm coil engine as an example of the potential problem this historic direction might be taking us so think with me here what does it mean when you take the current arena pool that's going to be historic and then just drop warm coil engine into it it'll be hands-down one of the thought the best six drops in that format which means most decks are probably going to run it probably going to run a playset of it I mean it is vastly superior to just about any other finisher currently available and it can go in literally any color deck so warm coil gets added and suddenly the format that was supposed to be the place to play with your old cards that can't be used and standard anymore and can't be dusted or traded away suddenly that place becomes the format where your old cards just aren't as good as these new special cards that are being put up for sale warm coil engined are confidant and dozens of other powerhouses from the past who knows maybe we'll get ven dillion clique or noble hierarch lots of old cards are being added to the historic format but not as a part of any larger organic set they're just being plucked out of all of the sets and sold to us and those are the cards that you need to be playing and yes paying for and you'll be paying double if you want those cards scratch that you'll be paying double for these newly added cards that you're probably going to kind of need in order to play in that historic format competitively anyway a recent quote explaining the need for double the price of historic cards is so that players have the most fun playing this game ah yes there's just nothing as fun as paying twice as much as what you're used to for digital goods that also means that any cards that are rotating out that you haven't already grabbed say shocked lands will be two wild cards each instead of one so snap them up now or you'll have to pay double fun but hey this is big bucks for wizards again which is then going to incentivize them to follow this pattern program in another dozen historic cards and enter the profits and its profits more in line with real world modern in that these historic cards and decks will always have that artificially inflated value except there is a difference which is that I can sell my modern deck or trade cards from it I could also get years of play out of it and its cards whereas these sporadic injections likely wreak havoc the format doing what Wizards of the coast seems to always want out of their non rotating formats which is creating a constant need for changing decks a pseudo rotation and it's critical to keep in mind that throughout all of this historic was supposed to be the place where we had a reason and a purpose for our old rotated out cards but these injections kind of defeat at least in part that purpose it's covering up the fact that half your collection is about to rotate out in a system that has no dusting no trading you just need to refill everything all over again as far as standard is concerned and then have this process repeat itself next year at the next rotation the best thing for the long-term health of the game and system would be to have either a dusting or trade system but failing that the next best thing would be instead of releasing bursts of a handful of magics greatest hits to acquire for double the price to just release classic sets as you would any other set letting people flash backdraft collect cards redeem wild cards at the regular rate and have historic work its way backwards and there's no rush yeah it's resource intensive to program in new sets but you know what this doesn't have to be done all at once pace yourself take a breath work on the friends list and max support and get rid of those cats that are causing the lag we already have almond cat and Cal adesh fully programmed on arena and half of shadows over innistrad is also programmed in so do the slow drip it's a lot of work and a lot of time and a lot of energy to program in those cards but again there's no rush start with almond cat maybe even three to six months after historic hits let us draft it in a flash backdraft in between standard sets perhaps and redeem wild cards at the normal rate and play all of this that we acquire in historic then take a breath do Cal adesh next er you know what maybe skip Cal adesh finish off that shadows block let shadows over innistrad come out next see how the format looks you want to spice things up maybe lorwyn remastered is something that you might look to offer in the future in time to come but you have that time and I want to be really clear on this adding old sets to historic to arena this is a really good thing but just dropping in random cards to the historic format is a poorly thought-out implementation pursue instead flashback drafts take your time work your way back where it's ad older sets look to one day offer original innistrad or perhaps in asteroid remastered on arena not just hey here's Liliana and snap caster enjoy and charging double for the format also greatly hinders entry into the format and that hindrance increases exponentially with time stop trying to dictate how people enjoy the game you know what if a lot of people are on arena playing historic and you're like well I really wish they were playing standard be happy they're playing arena it's the same game and if you've got the same wild card Redemption then just leave it at that sacrificing long-term stability for short-term profits is ultimately going to harm long-term profits build a format instead to last but that is of course just what I am winning on about today what about you I want to hear what you think of the historic format do you even want old cards at all do you think historic should just be moving forward from what we have on arena with no old cards added ever would you like to see one set from Magic's past two sets from magics Past going backwards added every year back to origins back before or do you like what's being announced and agree with the idea of two wild cards for historic cards let me know your
