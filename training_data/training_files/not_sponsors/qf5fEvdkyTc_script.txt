hi i'm eric gloss and i'm phillip molina and avengers in-game was the best of emotional roller coasters roller coasters that redefine quantum physics and kill your best friends can require two people to break it down because those roller coasters are not safe there is so much movie to break down three hours of satisfying nods to marvel past an even subtler layer of meaning hidden in the visual and background details and little sneaky winks from the filmmakers to reward obsessives like us for re-watching the movie over and over and over and over again which we already have done and we haven't slept we are going to cover it all scene by scene and spoiler warning in case you know we've already predicted anything too right and your life is already ruined sorry if you somehow haven't seen the movie yet what's it like to have your mind still intact must feel nice avengers end game opens on the farm home of clint barton hawkeye m.i.a and infinity war and now facing his turn at heartbreak his opening line is an archery lesson to his daughter lila played by ava russo real-life daughter of co-director joe russo he says you see where you're going now let's worry about how you get there hearing this over the opening image of an arrow tip reflects in game's deeper meaning as a story about destinations and trajectories in this coming time heist a term coined from a guy that clint last saw clinging to one of these aero tips identifying the destinations will be a lot easier of a challenge than the meticulously precise trajectory that they must bullseye to succeed at it so already here we're noticing some nods to past mcu films hawkeye wears an ankle monitor which he and scott lang both had to wear after their involvement in civil war because they're the two family men and they couldn't get on team cap they couldn't go on the run and abandon their families also this exact target that they're practicing on appeared already in clint's barn in age of ultron and clint calls his daughter hawkeye which is actually kind of crazy that name almost never gets said out loud in the mcu it's like he's ashamed of it but it does indicate that maybe lila barton might be being set up as a future kate bishop legacy figure ah but not so fast because you can't really fire an arrow in your pile of dust all of clint's family lila his wife laura his sons cooper and nate they all dust away and if you're listening closely the sound mixers work in some ominous rumble of thunder that accompanied the snapdramath and infinity war in wakanda oh god oh yes i'm calling this aftermath i will never call it the decimation moving on to the marvel studios title which erased all the dusted characters who used to be there like black panther and star-lord and groot and left only these six original avengers they also erased ant-man which is kind of rude because dude wasn't dead but he was just in the quantum realm to the survivors i guess that is as good as being dusted but not to erect and the music here is dear mr fantasy by traffic and that's a song that must have been on like the zune that yondu left for peter quill back in guardians vol 2. the lyrics though perfectly reflect what we're asking tony stark to do in this movie dear mr fantasy play us a tune do anything take us out of this gloom make it snappy please don't be sad if it was a straight mind you had we wouldn't have known you all these years tony is our mr fantasy and rescuing the universe from the post thanos gloom with a snappy move of his own all from the mad scientist who maybe if he had had a straight mind all those years ago we wouldn't have known you all these years these 11 years that we got with him so stark and nebula are on board the benetar they're drifting out in space away from titan they're flicking these folded footballs not only does this foreshadow start flicking ant-man later in the film football will essentially be the name of the game in the movie's third act with stark's gauntlet as the football being passed from avenger to avenger on this huge rush to the goal line though with all this unnecessary roughness it's more like rugby nebula ends up winning this game a first for her considering she always loses against gamora throughout their youth when they would have to spar for thanos leading to her becoming a walking pile of scraps in the infinity gauntlet comics nebula has a massive victory in this comeback against thanos and this in-game film shows nebula's first on-screen victory then tony records a goodbye message to pepper and his helmet saying they've been stranded for 22 days one day for every mcu movie which would have been a nice way for him to pass that time but he probably didn't have access to netflix stark also made a similar helmet recording for pepper and iron man 3 and here he begins it by saying not to post it on social media which is both a meta comment to fans to not spoil endgame on social media but it's also a callback to the opening of the first iron man i don't want to see this on your myspace [ __ ] god that is such an old movie now tony ends the message by signing off saying it's you it's always been you which is what he told pepper when he made her ceo of stark industries in iron man 2. it's you it's always been you and as he says this tony slides his thumb along the helmet's eyepiece as if wiping away a tear the helmet is scarred and damaged on its right side foreshadowing stark's appearance at the moment of his death mortally wounded from his gauntlet snap on his right side captain marvel then rescues tony and nebula and from watching this movie alone it's not totally clear how carol danvers knew where to find him and if she just stumbled upon him or something the post-credits scene of captain marvel did show her arriving at avengers headquarters on earth and that scene wasn't in this movie so maybe just carol learned from rocket where the benatar's homing signal was and tracked it that way sure also that would mean that thor was not interested in saving them who knows when she then tows them back home though tony is now struggling to stand part of that is because of earth's gravity since titan and space have lighter gravity than earth but also tony has become like incredibly frail and it looks as though i'd hoped that the visual effects team is the one who digitally thinned him down a lot and that created a really interesting contrast beside cap you gotta remember chris evans was also digitally thinned down in the first captain america so this is visually right here linking tony stark with the brave sacrificial hero steve rogers what he started as and kind of near the end for tony but we're going to actually get to more on stark and cap's opposite end points later inside avengers hq the screen shows other mcu snap victims including oh my god dr eric selva your favorite the thor movies remember in the dark world he had that loopy blackboard it actually featured several theoretical physics concepts that ended up being true in this movie things like shrew dinger's cat referring to the quantum theory in which an unobservable thing exists in multiple states until we look at it just like the multiple realities that this movie's version of time travel creates or the way our brains were like oh okay but also like wait huh as we watch this stuff someday i'm sure they will call it schrodinger's loki you'll see why stark reignites the debate he had with cap and age of ultron bringing back up this image of a suit of armor around the world and them losing but losing together that scene in ultron was the origin of endgame as the title of this movie we're the avengers we can bust arms dealers all the live long day but that up there that's that's the end game sounds like a good title so rocket now is wearing this slick blue suit which is a nod to the blue button jumpsuit he wore in the 2008 guardian comics by dan avnet and also andy lanning he explains that thanos using the infinity stones created it's my favorite part of the movie actually it's real subtle an unprecedented energy surge we know that the stones emit gamma radiation right which gave bruce banner his powers so this wave of energy could have a side effect that resulted in boom mutants all over the universe being introduced in the mcu right now it's right here i said it was my favorite part of the movie that's not true i love this movie in a bunch of different ways but x-men could happen now it's possible nebula explains that thanos's retirement planet is called the garden which is another example of how the mad titan is being depicted as a spiritual figure right an infinity war thanos said that after gathering the six stones he would finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe he's like the old testament god in the book of genesis who created slash destroyed everything in six phases and now resting on the seventh with this garden kind of serving as the movie's garden of eden paradise so then thor greets captain marvel but on the table before him are hawaiian sweet rolls and beer it's athena from the creature comforts brewery and then later he drinks tropical from creature comforts so right now we've already got this indication of how thor has been carbon loading into his depression leading to the melted ice cream appearance he's got going later also then they fly off on the benatar through a hexagonal wormhole in space that's the same kind we keep seeing we saw it in the guardians movies and in captain marvel that's how they get to titan two and then there's this close-up of capsule i as the stars streak past it's actually similar to the eye close-up that's in the stargate sequence in film nerds know this 2001 a space odyssey but it's also in the opening shot of blade runner cap looks at a compass showing a photo of peggy carter his longtime love from another time cap keeps her in this compass as a way to symbolize the way that she was his moral compass and the way that she's kind of a north star guiding his thematic journey in this film when cap sat at her bedside and went her soldiers she told him the world has changed none of us can go back all we can do is our best and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over it's interesting now to see how those exact words inspired cap and endgame to find a way to go back before the world changed and to start over then on titan 2 thanos has now retired as a just sweet old man farmer hanging his armor up as a scarecrow just like how thanos actually spends his post-snap retirement in the comics there's a shot of his injured gauntlet grazing the weird corn stalks that actually feels like a nod to ridley scott's shot in gladiator the warrior maximus is returning home he keeps dreaming of that but then ultimately when he finally gets that it's because he's died so really it's just like thanos's death here that we're about to see because of course the avengers crashed thanos's dinner which is real rude and then they realized he used the stones to destroy the stones nebula says my father's many things a liar is not one of them and the movies actually keep making that point thanos never actually lies in infinity war he told gamora but i never taught you to lie and in guardians vol 2 quill tells nebula you know you'd think an evil super villain would learn how to properly lie thanos never actually needed to teach his daughters to lie because also it was a fail-safe against them ever being able to betray him and his refusal to lie makes him way more fearsome since every threat he makes is a literal promise then thor goes for the head and killing off thanos early like this is really a false victory now sure it's exactly what we wanted thor to do and sure there's a satisfaction to the thud that brolin's head makes as it's brolin on the floor but kind of like seeing brad pitt given to his wrath and execute the bald villain of another spiritually based story sev then number seven then like john doe death is what thanos wanted here and now the heroes are in an even bleaker state the movie then jumps five years into the future the screenwriters marcus and mcfeely wanted to evoke that what reaction that viewers have to surprising time jumps and tv shows like in fargo and in lost this allows them to actually start over and reimagine each avenger and surprise us with how they each respond to lost differently post-apocalyptic new york is totally covered in fog with boats moored at liberty island and cap later says that he spotted whales out in the hudson river since you know fewer boats have made the water cleaner and marine life has been less hunted but actually if you re-watch that shot you can see surfacing whales right there in the water cap sits in a grief support group featuring a big cameo by co-director joe russo playing the first openly gay character in the mcu describing a depressing date that he went on russo has played lots of different characters in all of his marvel movies the surgeon who faked nick fury's death and winter soldier the psychiatrist dr brassard in civil war and bert the photographer in a deleted scene from infinity war the group actually is led by another cameo by jim starlin author of the infinity gauntlet series and co-creator the thanos character and we move on to san francisco where scott lang's ex-con van left stranded after ant-man and the wasp is now in storage but the unit number is 616. a nod to marvel 616 the number of the base reality in the marvel multiverse from the comics actually we saw spider-man into the spider-verse amazing film the original peter parker was from earth 616 and now the mcu is establishing the existence of multiple realities in this live-action universe then the quantum tunnel spits out scott and he alerts a security guard played by ken jeong if you weren't sure if it was him yeah it was him the russo brothers worked with jiang on the sitcom community and there's actually another community cameo with event nicole brown later in the movie they've also cast community uh actors danny poody and also jim rash in past movies but here's the thing jeong's character the security guard he's reading a book by j.g ballard called terminal breach it's a 1964 collection of short stories one of which is titled endgame ballard is known for his post-apocalyptic fiction and considering the times it kind of makes sense that people would be digging this kind of literature the black death of the middle ages which wiped out half of europe that actually similarly led to the popularity of dark and really morbid themes in literature and art scott finds this memorial set up in the park with names of victims that are of course all easter eggs one is roberto de costa aka the mutant sunspot from the x-men comics really the first firm acknowledgement of the x-men characters in the mcu there are also just like a ton of names of crew people who worked on various marvel films and tv shows but there's really too many dimensions so let's just like snap through them all [Music] that's good and then snapping back oh what was it like down there milk and back at adventures headquarters natasha holds a conference call while making a sandwich cutting it diagonally which maybe is a nod to nick fury who in captain marvel he revealed he refuses to eat sandwiches diagonally maybe natasha cuts her sandwiches that way as a force of habit to keep fury's flurking hands off her lunch also during this call okoye mentions an underwater earthquake which could be establishing the existence of namor and atlantis in the mcu they're at battle with wakanda in the comics of various times so we could be setting that up right now also carol danvers just gotta call out cute new haircut not loving it but hey you do you it does reflect the look that she has in the comics and also when she turns to roadie and she gives them that longer look than normal saying be careful that actually could be a nod to the romantic relationship between captain marvel and the actor don cheadle in the comics or wait no war machine and on the chair beside natasha some ballet slippers are visible this suggests that natasha's probably returning to her ballet training from her youth in the kgb perhaps as a way to keep her focused and centered maybe as a form of self-discipline scott lang shows up with the van babbling about time and the quantum realm and how the past five-year period actually felt like only five hours to him janet van dyne if you remember hinted at the existence of time vortexes in the quantum realm in ant-man and the wasp and don't get sucked into a time vortex we won't be able to save you this leads them to the new home of tony stark everyone's on farms stark's fulfilling his retirement dream that he mentioned back at the end of age of ultron maybe i should take a page out of barton's book build pepper a farm hope nobody blows it up pepperidge farms oh my god it's the whole time his daughter is morgan the name he brought up to pepper early in infinity war she wears a blue iron man helmet which tony says he was making for pepper joking that she never wears anything he buys for her he's foreshadowing the later reveal of pepper's new rescue armor revealed in the final battle then tony compares scott's time heist plan to the plot of back to the future and when scott says the rules are to never bet on sporting events or meet your past self those are obviously things that marty mcfly does in back to the future part two the whole end game plot though is actually structured pretty similarly with the heroes sneaking around their past selves in the background of scenes from past films falling in love with their mothers it's real amazing the screenwriters actually said that they brought in professional theoretical physicists they brought them in to consult on this story and they told them that real quantum physics do not follow hollywood rules one of those physicists might have been david deutsch from oxford whom stark name drops here quantum fluctuation messes with the plank scale which in turn triggers the deutsch proposition davidoish is one of the world's leading proponents of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics which proposes that alternate histories and futures exist which is really the basis of the version of time travel in avengers endgame deutsche moving on to the reveal of bruce banner who has now merged his brain with the brawn of the hulk kind of like eric he's adapted from the professor hulk version of the character in the comics the screenwriters said that while working on civil war they were inspired by the old marvel what-if comics and dreamed of pursuing wild hypotheticals for the avengers and endgame like what if the hulk is a smart celebrity what if thor is fat what if hawkeye becomes a murderer and also the broader what if of just what if the avengers lost there's also a few more cameos here the kids who asked for autographs from hulk are joe and anthony russo in disguise or no it's actually their denis and nephews the older one actually cameoed in winter soldier too as the boy who recognized cap in the museum stark looks at a photo of himself and peter parker notice the certificate from stark industries is upside down because this is just a fake photo to convince aunt may that peter's internship was legit there's also a nearby photo of howard stark tony's father hinting at howard's appearance later stark cracks the code of time travel by running a simulation on an inverted mobius strip this movie's version of i guess folding a napkin in half and poking a pencil through it and stark puts his daughter to bed love you tons i love you three thousand adorable because morgan is referencing the fact that a ton equals two thousand pounds so she loves tony three thousand truly her father's daughter but he said love you tons which would be four thousand so she's like she's a kid she's a child dark also rejoins the team and says scott's hilarious age fluctuation was the result of the epr paradox that's actually the einstein podulsky rosen paradox it's also connected to the idea of schrodinger's cat basically that subatomic particles change when they're observed and measured so scott meddling in the quantum realm made it too chaotic to control so stark's solution are these quantum realm wristbands that allow you to move through time rather than time move through you stark tells cap i just want peace flashing him a peace sign it's a nod to their past rivalry and it's also not actually the opening scene of iron man yeah peace i love peace be out of a job with peace stark seals the deal by returning caps shield restored after its damage in civil war but even more interesting stark also removes a reddish orangish briefcase from his trunk leak set photos revealed that this briefcase was labeled barf for stark's binary augmented retro framing memory tech and civil war we don't see stark explicitly barf in endgame but he might have used it to help the avengers scan their memories about their encounters with infinity stones in the past or to help record his post-mortem goodbye to pepper and morgan that projected out of his helmet later so moving on to the new asgard colony located in townsburg norway this is the same location that odin actually fought the frost giants in the first thor movie and it's the location of the church where the tesseract was hidden in ragnarok odin sat on these norwegian cliffs telling thor remember this place in the comics says guardians established a similar colony on earth a floating city though of asgard near broxton oklahoma which is real creepy to citizens of normal oklahoma we get confirmation that the other asgardians led by valkyrie were spared by thanos in the beginning of infinity war and then we meet my favorite character in this movie fat thor the best response to the gratuitous shirtlessness that chris hemsworth has brought into the mcu more than anyone else he lives with meek and korg from ragnarok core gets voiced by ragnarok director taika watiti and he wears the same pineapple shirt that watiti wore at comic con korg plays fortnite and asks thor to scare away a troll named noob noobmaster69 i am going to fly to your house come down to that basement where you're hiding in and rip off your arms and shove them up your butt maybe it's just me but doesn't this kind of seem like a nod to the furry flabby roommate ehrlich bachman in silicon valley who defended richard from the neighborhood bullies you get in your [ __ ] house and you get me five adderall or i'll split your throat yeah that might be a reference they're making in a disney movie speaking of psychopath natasha finds hawkeye in tokyo and as she flies in half of the city's buildings have the lights off reflecting half of its residents being gone hawkeye has taken on the ronin incarnation finally of this character he's a lone japanese warrior he kills the yakuza boss akihiko a yakuza villain from the marvel comics he and clint face off in a long unbroken sword duel and the filmmakers were able to pull this off because akihiko is played by badass japanese actor sanata hiroyuki who has played a ton of yakuza and samurai roles all over the place including shenzhen yoshida in the wolverine back at hq banner scott and rody debate the rules of time travel in this movie they reference past time travel stories like back to the future terminator time cop handsome leap hot tub time machine but the first reference is star trek which actually was a direct inspiration for the plot of endgame the screenwriters said it was kevin feige himself who tasked them to bring time travel into the endgame story and feige has compared the story to the finale episode of star trek the next generation which featured multiple alternate timelines all having to converge together to save the universe rudy suggests killing thanos as a baby a nod to the baby hitler premise which we saw play out in deadpool 2 but banner explains that time travel in this movie does not result in a ripple effect change to your own timeline it creates a new branch timeline alongside the original timeline which remains unchanged so after a successful test with clint the gang comes back together stark calls thor lebowski because dude looks exactly like jeff bridges playing the dude in the big lebowski bridges also though played obadiah stain in the first iron man and thor being the dude now is also kind of a call back to the guardians marveling at his amazing physique in infinity war he is not a dude you're a dude this is a man the adventures then brainstormed their time heist leading them to revisit the plot of past marvel films so amazing including thor the dark world which thor drunkenly had been making fun of the dark elves ooh scary there's that photo of jane foster and that's actually the same image from the first avengers when coulson explained why she wasn't in that movie they realized that three stones were in new york at the same time the space stone and the tesseract the mind stone and loki scepter and the time stone in the sanctum sanctorum in the aya vagamoto necklace located over on bleaker street actually originally the screenwriter said that early drafts featured tony stark going to asgard instead considering the ether and the tesseract were both briefly there at the same time apparently tony was going to be an invisible stealth suit and then have to fight heimdall who would be able to see him there also rejected ideas to go to morag when it was still underwater or to go to the triskelion and they said that someone was just going to hop in their car and drive to dr strange's house yeah eventually joe russo just said hey this is avengers end game why don't we just go back to the first avengers and everyone's like shut the front door and real quick the side details of this brainstorming session are amazing hulk eats this ice cream flavor a hunka hulka burning fudge remember that was the ben jerry flavor a favorite of wong in infinity war a hunger hulk burning fudge is our favorite that's a thing and uh yeah nebula just can't use chopsticks apparently so cab gives his pre-mission speech and they throw their hands in and it creates this really cool visual that they really focus on from that above shot tony stark's original arc reactor has that same design that their fists are making over the time travel devices platform platform sure all of that is actually foreshadowing that original arc reactor's return in the funeral scene it also foreshadows the weakness that tony's old-school arc reactor contains which present-day tony actually is gonna exploit also that hands-in shot is similar to the cover of the issue of the new avengers in which the marvel illuminati used the infinity stone to reassemble the infinity gauntlet so the avengers then zip down into the quantum realm flying through time vortexes or textes they resemble wormhole tunnels that each split off in different directions reflecting the branch timelines that these disruptions of the main timeline will cause okay let's break down each stone mission one by one first let's talk about the time stone which they retrieved by going to the battle of new york from the first avengers film in 2012 but banner hulk finds the ancient one in the middle of this battle on the roof of the sanctum santorum confirming that sorcerers were actually helping in this battle of new york just behind the scenes kind of protecting their own turf just the roof of their building now you might be saying that the ancient one was not the guardian of the new york sanctum before strange remember that was master drum but maybe drum was just on the ground level here and the ancient one was giving back up on the roof and yeah everyone wants to see tilda swinton again the ancient one knocks banner out of his hulk body into the astral plane just like she did to steven strange when they first met in commartosh and even though it's four years before strange will even become a sorcerer the ancient one is aware of him and his destiny as sorcerer supreme since remember she does have the time stone she probably uses it to see into the future so i guess if the ancient one made anyone else aware of strange's future general importance that might explain how hydra considered strange a person of interest in 2014. bruce banner stephen strange anyone who's a threat so the ancient one draws a big timeline and explains to banner how removing the stones causes the timeline to split into branch realities her theory of timeline meddling was actually established already by mordo back in doctor strange temporal manipulations can create branches in time but banner then tells her that strange willingly surrendered the time stone to thanos and a little light goes on above the ancient one shining off her forehead we all got excited because suddenly all of our theories that doctor strange had a mysterious plan involving timelines were kind of confirmed except they weren't exactly what we predicted but they were very close the ancient one said she was unable to see past her death but she trusts that future strange will know more about the complexities of timelines than anyone else could next the reality stone in either form in asgard back in 2013 during the events of thor the dark world loki jane foster and thor's mother friega reappear from that movie freak asks thor what's wrong with his eye and he says that it was injured in the battle of huracan which is a callback to when he and sif recalled the battle of hurricane in the dark world i remember you celebrated the battle of hurricane so much that you nearly started the second there's actually another really cool mcu easter egg in asgard here but done it without you mwah okay back to asgard when thor reconnects with his mother he drinks the same asgardian liquor that he and calf shared with stan lee in age of ultron this was aged for a thousand years the barrels built from the wreck of grund hill's fleet is not meant for mortal men neither was omaha beach plunty stop trying to scare us and after rockets steals the ether out of jane the asgardians chasing him shout stop rabbit apparently rocket just looks like all the asgardian rabbits it just means that asgardian rabbits are like pretty jacked they're really big dudes uh next the space stone and the mine stone are in avengers tower and is back in the battle of new york in 2012 one really cool thing about this sequence is the way that it connects the dots between the end of the first avengers movie and what it came after we've always wondered some details here for instance he previously had just shown up randomly with like this mouth gag on which could have been uh for a bunch of weird reasons but actually was because it was slapped on him by thor after loki wouldn't stop impersonating the other avengers like cap setting up loki's later cap impersonation in the dark world then agent sitwell brock rumlow and secretary pierce they all show up and they're all secretly part of hydra so when they take loki's scepter sitwell mentions bringing it to dr list which finally explains how he came to have the scepter in the beginning of age of ultron cap of course then retrieves it in the callback to the famous so good elevator scene from winter soldier but he avoids the fight completely by just whispering hale hydra which is actually a reference to the comics where cap is actually potentially a member of hydra and has a similar little speech bubbles yeah that awkward time in caps history we all just forget about in the lobby thor says that they are headed to lunch a nod to the shawarma post-credits scene after avengers and tony has ant-man restaged the armor infiltration from civil war on his past self knowing that in 2012 that was before he got his arc reactor surgery in iron man 3. and that old school arc reactor would make that version of stark vulnerable to sudden cardiac arrest as he was in the first iron man movie but stark is such an expert in the timeline of his own armor generations that he knew an electric shock from thor's hammer wouldn't kill him because remember in the first fight of that movie with thor the lightning just supercharged his suit in every mcu film the new iron man armor fixes vulnerabilities that were exposed in previous films kind of like that nanotech armor infinity war was just a way to prevent ant-man from being able to slip in the cracks as he didn't civil war but tony's knowledge here of his own history allows him to exploit a previous flaw in his own system so then capp uses the same tactic to defeat his past self and score the mind stone the two caps have the great fight with the younger one saying i could do this all day which the old man is rolling his eyes saying uh i know but present cap breaks the headlock by saying bucky is alive which yeah that's the mcu equivalent of save martha but actually it's not just that because present cap is actually remembering his fight with crossbones in civil war when romelo distracts him and breaks his concentration by bringing up bucky now your buddy your bucky what did you say martha stark almost got away with the space stone but his pastel forcing hulk to take the stairs caused hulk to smash through the door and hit present stark later in the movie stark says that the past has a way of messing back with you so present stark also walks away from this medlin with a few bruises thanks to his past self getting back at him 2012 loki snatches the tesseract and portals away creating probably a new branch timeline most likely but this forces start to think back on the last time the space stone and extra pin particles were in the same place and he realizes that in 1970 his father howard stark worked with hank pym at the shield base at campbell lehigh in new jersey that is the camp where steve rogers trained in his first movie and where cap realized hydra had corrupted shield and winter soldier that base got destroyed then so stark and cab jump again and here we see the final stan lee cameo he plays an anti-war hippie who drives past a military base shouting make love not war but actually the bumper sticker on the car also reads nuff said which was one of stan's catchphrases also cap's stolen uniform has the name roscoe on it roscoe simons was the name of the character who briefly took over the captain america mantle when steve rogers became nomad in the comics meanwhile tony's stolen blazer features the old school shield logo from the comics this whole time high seems to borrow a bit from the christopher nolan movie inception which is a similar group heist that featured perfect timing and layers within layers and here in this deepest layer while stealing the tesseract tony stark has a cathartic reunion with his father much like the father-son catharsis at the bottom layer of inception howard stark finds tony saying that he's looking for dr zola a reference to zola the hydra operative who secretly corrupted shield and cap finds peggy carter's office reminding him of his wonderful north star in this movie and then he goes into hank pym's lab where he passes the original ant-man helmet from the comics and he steals some pym particle vials now we'll break down all the complicated timeline ramifications another timeline but we should note that it's not really clear whether cap ever returns these hank pym particles so these missing vials could be the source of hank pym's distrust of howard stark could you turn me into your errand boy and now you try to steal my research howard's driver is actually edwin jarvis the origin of tony's jarvis voice and the ai that would later become vision he's played by james darcy who actually plays jarvis in the agent carter tv series and this is actually the first character to cross over from marvel tv to the films sorry all those promises to the netflix actors and moving on to the power stone on morag the planet in the beginning of the guardians of the galaxy in 2014 natasha kicks in orloni which is exactly what peter quill did to that thing in the opening credits of guardians and we once again hear red bones come and get your love from the volume one mixtape but i love this so much and it's also back to the future reference uh just being able to see things from a different perspective now and that perspective has nebula and roadie hearing quill singing it out loud from a distance but they can't hear the music it's in the soundtrack so it makes them look like even more of an idiot they were able to grab the orb from the temple easily enough but nebula gets stuck behind because her network gets crosswired with past nebula who along with gamora was still a child of thanos here when the sisters realized that thanos has found the first infinity stone gamora expresses a hesitation well it's the first of six her subtle doubt here masks a hidden concern about thanos overall plot which will later justify pascamore's sudden decision to switch sides and while learning about nebula's connection with the avengers past thanos calls them unruly which is a nod to the post-credits scene that revealed the mcu thanos in which the other described the avengers this exact and way cannot be ruled and also i'm going to die suddenly when ronan stabs my neck and finally the soul stone on vormir which nebula earlier described as a dominion of death at the very center of celestial existence her use of the term celestial could be a nod to marvel's celestials they're ancient godlike beings whom we know from the collector's story and guardians of the galaxy and they have a history with the infinity stones red skull told thanos that the soul stone has a special wisdom unique to the other stones perhaps the celestials establish the soul stone on vormir with a stone keeper and this blood sacrifice all to make it extremely difficult for anyone to gather all the stones as clint and natasha head to vermeer clint says we're kind of a long way from budapest referencing the backstory between these two alluded to in the first avengers movie you and i remember budapest very differently in captain marvel nick fury mentioned only ever working in cities that begin with the letter b leading some speculation that the black widow solo movie could be a prequel with hawkeye and fury finally showing us whatever they all happen in budapest and when these two meet red skull he greets them as natasha son of ivan clint son of edith remember red skull greeted thanos as lars being the name of his father the fact that red skull greets clint as son of edith barton his mother could be a nod to the comics where clint was abused by his father and was really more connected to his mom perhaps red skull as the keeper of the soul stone has some insight to see which parental figure really defined your soul and identity natasha says she never even knew her father named ivan so some are saying her father could be ivan vanco whiplash from iron man 2 but i don't think so ivan is also one of the most common russian names also after a heartbreaking but kind of badass struggle natasha sacrifices herself so that clint can get the stone restaging the same pose and the exact same music of gamora's death in infinity war natasha dying here means that the gamora of this timeline never needs to it's a life for a life balance as all things should be that brings us to the end of the second act and as we're looking ahead at this third act we realize there is so much more that we want to break down so many easter eggs so many connections to everything else and this has been a long video it's a three hour long movie we're breaking down so we want to give this next act it's due diligence and really the third act of the movie is pretty much its own movie all on its own so we're going to break it down in a separate breakdown it's going to come out tomorrow if it's not up already we're gonna explain the insane amounts of easter eggs and marvel cameos how this new thanos makes the thanos from infinity war look like a saint and how the hell cap left this timeline or timelines like i bet you're wondering did he have to interact with red skull again to get the salsa back can you put this also back who knows
