my name is ESO and in today's video we are going to be discussing who exactly is the best follower in the Companions guild in Skyrim the Companions guilt actually has the largest collection of followers in the game to choose from there are a total of seven different characters we can pick from and not only are they powerful warriors but you can also ask them for training in many different skills and then simply take the money back from their inventory after adding them as a follower effectively getting free training from each person and I'll go over exactly how to do this in the video but first a word and start playing Elsword right now now a lot of people don't actually know you can have two companion followers at one time instead of just the normal one follower that the game is usually capped at and I'll go over exactly how you can do this in this video as well as comparing every single companion follower to discover which one is truly the best now if this sort of video interests you please make sure you subscribe and press that Bell icon and then YouTube will let you know every time I release a new Skyrim weekly guide or you can check out my playlist below for every single build secret and unique weapon in Skyrim so if you didn't know the Companions guild is located here in Whiterun in the heart of the city the hall is actually an upturned boat and after you have finished the entirety of the companions quest line and the final quest which is named glory of the dead you'll be able to recruit all of the followers we're going over in this video let's start off with reiha an imperial warrior who will level with your character from level 5 to level 25 where she'll stop leveling completely this basically means there are better options past level 25 but at this level she will have 330 health 50 Magica and a hundred and 30 stamina she specializes in heavy armor one-handed archery and block as her primary skills she also is effectively a tank character with an aggressive personality to boot now you want your tanks to be aggressive because then they're always going to run in and attack the enemy first getting the aggro away from you so you can focus on dealing the damage if you're playing a squishy type of character but ultimately considering she doesn't level past level 25 it's going to always limit her use to us though you can recruit her as a member of the blades or even marry her next let's talk about Tovar torva is a nord warrior which means he already has a natural 50% resistance to frost making him useful in the land of Skyrim which pretty much predominantly has 4 damage Nords also starts off with a buff to their block lights armor and one-handed skill of five points and ten points to their two-handed skill given them a further edge over everybody else now as far as personality goes if that's important to you he is the drunken misfit and and he can be quite entertaining sometimes however he like Korea is also capped at level 25 and has a health of three hundred and thirty fifty Magica and a hundred and thirty stamina he also specializes in heavy armor one-handed block and artery and has an aggressive personality making him a decent tank as well they're definitely slightly better because he's a Nord next we have Nevada Anna Jada stone arm what's a fantastic name she's a female Nord which is great if you just prefer a female companion though with a name like Nevada Stoneham I'd rather keep my distance between the sheets unfortunately she is also cats at level 25 however she is actually our worst follower yet in terms of her stats for a warrior character to be honest her stats don't really make any sense she has the lowest health of 266 and a stamina of only 98 and then for some unknown reason she has a hundred and forty-six Magica which makes absolutely no sense because she doesn't use any spells or know any magic and she really doesn't get any better once you take a look at her specialized skills being Bach one-handed and and speech and pickpockets very strange and pretty useless in fact the only reason your wants and the Jadus stone arm as a follower is to take advantage of her ability to train you in the block skill she's actually an expert block trainer meaning she can train you up to level 75 in the block skill now this is obviously super useful because block is a really really boring skill to train yourself so to do this little trick all you need to do is ask her for training in the block skill then pay her for level of training and then exit and talk to the Giada and ask her to trade items with you you can now just take your money back effectively making training free and then just exit ask for her to train you another level and repeat this step by step and so you have finally leveled up the maximum of five times after you've leveled five times you can simply exit and level up your character you can now talk to her again and she'll now level your blocks kill another five times for free just repeat this method over and over until you reach level 75 block now if you do have the unofficial patch installed this is actually patched but you can just install it because obviously it's a mod next let's talk about a 'thus the only dark elf in the companions guild and Dumba's or dark elfs have an innate 50% resistance to fire now this is obviously nice but it's nothing special since fire spells are a lot rarer than frost damage in Skyrim so ideally if you want to tank character you want them to be a Nord not a dark elf a theist is also capped at level 25 and I promise this is the last follower that's capped at level 25 but at that level he will have a health of 330 a magical of 50 and finally a stamina of a hundred and thirty he is also specialized in heavy armor one-handed block and archery like all the other warrior classes however he will also train you in the one-handed skill up to level 75 because like Nejad a stone arm he is also an expert trainer you can use the exact same method to get free one-handed skill level ups from the sky and obviously this is invaluable since so many players use the one-handed skill so we've gone over all of the level 25 capped followers and Tavor is the best out of all of them as a level 25 tank but now we will go over the best followers beyond that level 25 cap ones that you're actually going to use much later on in the game now rather usefully the remaining companions are all Nords so they all have a 50% resistance to frost they're also all werewolves and they will level with you from level 8 to level 50 making them all really really good follower choices let's starts out by discussing Farkas at his level cap of 50 he will have 600 health 50 Magica and 350 stamina he is however tagged as a blacksmith class which makes him rather pathetic other than his level 100 heavy armor skill and one-handed skill which would make him a good tank but for some reason his block skill is only level 20 he does however have a pig focusing skill of 100 with rythme makes no sense at all so Farkas really isn't that great as a follower compared to your other options that we're about to go over the only good thing about Farkas is that he's a master of heavy armor and he'll train you all the way up to level 100 for free using the trick we spoke about earlier next though we have Vilkas now Vilkas is Farkas Farkas Azure my god that as a tongue twister Fox's brother who is capped at level 50 but Vilkas has one of the highest health stats in the game of 635 he has a magic eye of 50 and a stamina of 215 Bilkis is considered to be a warrior and has some of the highest combat stats in the entire game he has a heavy armor skill of 100 a block skill of 100 and a two-handed skill of 100 of the son reason an archery skill of 98 which is really good his only drawback is that he's level 70 in the one-handed scale this pretty much makes Bilkis though the statistically vest level 50 two-handed warrior in the entire game and arguably the best tank since you can still block with the two-handed sword lidia however is slightly better stat with level 100 block and one-handed as well meaning she can use a sword and shield more effectively than Vilkas but I will talk about why that doesn't really matter at the end of the video when we talk about enchanting your followers weapons and also funnily enough you can actually have Vilkas as an extra companion in addition to any other follower of your choice but I'll also get to that at the end of the video as well first let's talk about a lair the Huntress what a absolute babe of a human she is also capped at level 50 and at this level she will have 465 health 50 magic ER and 385 stamina which is the most stamina in the entire game of any follower at level 50 she can also train you up to level 75 archery for free because she is an expert trainer as for her skills Ayla is considered to be a scout class so she actually has level 100 archery and level 97 snake unlike pretty much everyone else in this video who only has level 20 sneak making her the best follower for a sneaky base character who doesn't want to instantly get detected though to be honest with you when I'm playing my character I usually don't mind if my tank gets detected because then I can stay stealth and carry on getting lots of sneak attacks but she also has a light armor skill of 100 a one-handed skill of 75 but a block skill of 50 which is okay it's not bad but to be honest she's probably better off just jewel wielding weapons to achieve the maximum amount of damage so in short the best sneaky character in the Companions guild is Ayla the Huntress and the best tank based two-handed warrior in the Companions guild and indeed the entire game is Vilkas now funnily enough as I said you can actually have both following you at once let me now explain how to do this firstly you're going to get a lover Huntress as your normal standard follower secondly you need to do this after you finish the final quest for the companion storyline name glory of the dead you will then be able to talk to both Vilkas and Farkas for additional side quests after completing a few of them they'll eventually talk to you about a more personal quest it's called purity you can get the quest from either of them basically whenever you talk to them it will suddenly come up as a speech option and you'll be able to help them out with that quest the quest involves accompanying them back - yes Gramma's tomb to cleanse their beast blood however if you just accept the quest and then never actually finish it they will permanently follow you around forever and not actually count towards your maximum follower count because they're just quest followers so you can actually do this with either focus or Vilkas obviously Vilkas is the better choice and then you can just recruit another follower like Ayla the Huntress or Lydia or Serrano or whoever else you like to take up your normal followers long now it's worth noting that if a follower does only have like 300 health and level 70 one-handed skill don't let it put you off actually using them if you like their personality because you can't just give them an enchanted weapon and armor which increases their health and damage further in fact if you follow my other guides on how to use the restoration potion glitch in order to in shown your armor and weapons you can actually get weapons and armor that have a million armor and over a million damage pretty much making any follower in the game the best and invincible and doing ridiculous damage thank you so see you guys in the next video have a fantastic day and good bye
