about squarespace after the video so let's get started hey guys how's it going welcome to my channel today we're going to be doing some soda rebranding now if you're new to my channel and this is like the first time you're watching and i got very lucky and i showed up in your youtube algorithm hey welcome i recommend you subscribe down below if you want to see more videos from me if you do end up enjoying this something i do on my channel is redesigning popular logos and i kind of wanted to tackle some soda ones now i didn't grow up drinking soda my mom didn't really let us have it so i'm not really into soda but i know a lot of people are so i wanted to redesign some soda logos that are kind of either their iconic cult favorites they're ones that i don't really care for their branding or their logo and one that's kind of a classic that people generally are pretty familiar around the globe so for those three i have selected the first one i'm gonna be doing is sprite which i feel sprite is kind of just like a really popular one i feel like people know it all around the globe so i have sprite next i'm gonna our liquor store only had a giant leader is this no this is a two liter of mountain dew i'm gonna be doing mountain dew because i don't really care for this uh logo or the packaging at all i think it's like really dude bro esque which i know is like a good part of their demo but i want to revisit this a little bit so ignore my giant bottle of mountain dew and then the last one is going to be pretty much a cult favorite which is fanta so that was really a lot i'm sorry so between these three i think i have a pretty good range of different creative directions that i'm going to be going i want to give them a brighter young more modern approach yada yada you know my thing so i wanted to try these so before we get started i wanted to try some of these just so i can kind of like be more familiar with them because i really just i don't drink soda i love like plain sparkling water i love seltzer but i don't like flavored sodas like this so i can't tell you the last time i've had mountain dew i have no idea what it tastes like i've had fanta a few times and then i've had sprite a few times but i'm not really a fan of any of these i don't i think they're just too sweet so i have my cup cool okay so let's try sprite first please don't explode okay [Music] oh that's pretty good yeah it is lemony lemon lime i don't really like the bubble size and soda they're like really small bubbles i think and like a sparkling water like a top of chico the bubbles are bigger i don't know if that makes sense to other people but so we tried sprite now let's try mountain dew i want it to [Music] explode i don't think i'm gonna like this one that tasted just like sprite am i going insane it's like a slightly less sour sprite that's weird okay well i don't really know what the difference is between these guys i do know that i enjoy fanta yeah i like that it tastes like like just like a carbonated sunny d which i did have a few times as a child yeah i'm into that i feel like these two together would be pretty good all right so now that that is out of the way before we jump into designing i just want to say that i am a graphic designer i do do this for a living i went to school for graphic design if you want to check out my other videos talking about my journey through design and my experience in school check out some of the other videos on my channel i have quite a few if you want to see more of my work also i am taking a few freelance clients right now i don't have much space but if you are interested in working with me shoot me an email i will do my email and contact website portfolio everything down below and one last thing before we dive in like i have said in a few of my other videos this is all my own personal work this is what i do for fun i'm not reporting to anyone so i'm going off on my own creative journey here if you don't like what i do i'm sorry i understand that these are some things that are very near and dear to some people's hearts and i'm sorry if you don't like it but this is what i just do for fun so don't be mean okay okay okay so the first one i'm gonna be starting off with is sprite now sprite is like a classic american drink it's been around for let's check sprite is a colorless caffeine free lemon and lime flavored soft drink created by the coca-cola company it was first developed in west germany in 1959 interesting and it was introduced as a clear lemon fanta and was introduced to the united states under the current brand name sprite in 1961 as a competitor to 7up i feel like that's all we really need to know simple simple brand so let's get started so i already have a general idea of what i am going to be doing i have some very uh quick sketches that you can't even can't even see because it's so blown out you can see it back here cool so i think the first thing i want to start out with i'm gonna save this real quick cool soda.ai we're professional like always i enjoy using adobe fonts best place to get some fonts that are fully licensed for commercial use i have a few fonts in mind but i still want to like check a few out oh cool last time i was on adobe fonts everything was in spanish even though at the bottom it said it was in english so that was a good time and it's back to normal now okay so i have my sample text i do want to go with a sans serif i think something kind of a little bit with like a curl in the leg would be nice and i can't remember like i like something almost kind of like that but that's a little cornbally actually i had my other favorite fonts open let me see if i have any of none of those will work it's fine will it no i think that's a cool font but i would like something with this a little bit more that's cool so i'm gonna add that to my list oh that's a cool font okay let's do all the perilucent ones okay those are downloading moving on whoo that's kind of cool now the word sprite looks really weird to me and i've only been looking at it for a few minutes oh i like that one even more oh well let's just go with the ones that i've started with so let's see if i can spell so this first font i'm going to use is bureau grot which i think is a really great sans-serif bold font has a lot of variations within the font family and then hybrisia hypatia is another font that i grabbed so i'm into both of these they're actually quite nice i do like this one maybe i'll go with that one i think this one might be a little bit safe maybe a little bit better for some like romance coffee copy or something so i'm just gonna duplicate that see what a difference like good tracking and kerning can do really makes the word look like it has it together so that can just go away right here command shift o outlining ungroup and now i'm gonna go in and mess with these letters a little bit so i wanted to kind of like grab these individual corners i wanted to kind of like round it out a little bit kind of like that because i love like how this is really jagged and hard right there but also i kind of want it to have like that free flowing movement do you guys hear my computer like let me hold this that's what i'm dealing with no that looks weird maybe a little bit okay okay okay into that and i've learned that like rounding off these corners can really just like soften up a font and make it a little bit more custom instead of just like leaving it with those jagged edges i don't know i think it makes it look a little bit more artisanal and friendly that'll oh ooh oh i love that tea okay i do want to move these anchor points out though [Music] like so see what that looks like oh so cute i gotta stop saying cute as like a design adjective [Music] cute cute that kind of looks like a happy face awesome all right just cleaning up these last little bits now is this going to be the end of this logo now but i am going to use this as kind of my base to build off of for everything else do i want to pull that in no that looks really weird okay cool i'm gonna group that and then i'm gonna go up to object envelope distort make with warp and then generally i like to use the rise because like not so much in their current logo but they used to have this really cool like flag effect kind of like the text just went up this little like you know i'm into that again a little dark so i'm gonna keep that same general effect so maybe lessen that a little bit just like that actually maybe i'll keep a version without and then i'll do one with i mean there's all sorts of cool things you can do in here like one thing that is cool is the wave because it's very subtle but you can do some really awesome things with that um the flag is great but i like the direction that the rise option has it's a little intense maybe let's go a bit a bit less so now that i have that generally nailed down i'm going to start building out some colors so i'm going to hop over to pinterest pull some of the colors that i have in my boards because i do want to keep the green because that is a really fundamental part like just green and yellow in general they're important colors for sprite so i'm just rambling while i look for my board okay here's the one i was looking for so i was really into this really vibrant green right here which is pretty similar to the original sprite and also this cool orange it's like not really like an orange but like a salmony that's not quite sandy i think i could push it to be a little bit more like that i'll do one more for this dark green it's a little too dark for me i feel like maybe i should add a light blue might be kind of cute for the packaging cute oh my god would be nice for the packaging a little bit more sky blue oh yeah oh that's like that's like refreshing maybe a hint of this okay okay into that so now i'm going to start building out pretty much like what my lock up is going to be on like the front of the bottle or the can so i'm just going to grab this go to object expand expand it out so it's like all unlocked just gonna make the screen for now then i'm gonna see if i can do an offset path maybe we try some inside okay so just by doing that it kind of gives me a little bit more of this depth in here you could do a lot with these little secondary uh that was cool [Music] not into it okay so i'm going to do the same thing go to path offset path now i'm going to do it going outward like that i think this could be cool with gradient on it so we shall try that when we take it to photoshop so i'm just gonna clean this up like some of these pieces don't need to be so dramatic just clean that [Music] the o and this p is kind of alarmingly large i'm just gonna shrink that down a little bit maybe i'll scoot it over [Music] now for this next part i'm gonna draw what i hope to be as a lemon that looks weird i'm just gonna use the pen tool [Music] cool so that's my general walk up for right now i'm gonna do some more once i throw it in photoshop and actually start mocking it up on what it would look like probably on a can i don't want to mock it up on a bottle because the format for a bottle isn't as interesting as i can the label is just a lot smaller versus on can i can have a lot more vertical space and also i have the full wrap to work with versus just that so this is the general idea maybe this could go a little bit lighter of a yellow yeah more into that let's see maybe i push this green a little bit lighter too i don't want it to look like minty green though cool cool okay so like i said i'll do more once i get in photoshop but for right now i'm gonna go ahead and start kind of locking up if i had a space for the front of a can say it's about about yay i'm just gonna lock that so if that were like my can front i would take this and kind of have it wrap right there and then i was envisioning this since like on the can it's so like just green i wanted to infuse two more colors because a part of sprite's history is the slogan that they used to have which was um oh i forgot it so their old slogan was i like to sprite in you which pretty much means like i like something something unique something kind of pizzazzy about you so what i imagine for this is like something kind of like springy and bright and like energetic so i wanted to add these kind of like rays coming out from behind it but i don't know if it'll actually work i might end up just putting a gradient because who knows um so the way i'm gonna do that is with a stroke so i'm gonna go window stroke dash line and then i can mess with like the limit of the dash line so i can do like not the limit mess with the width of the dash you can't quite see it because it's selected but so it's pretty much like how condensed you want the rays to be so if i want them to be a little bit less condensed and just have less of them something like that so a higher num higher point in the dash the wider it'll be maybe i'll go like 35 cool and then you just blow the heck out of the weight so if i'm thinking something kind of like that it got a lot smaller so once that's done i'm gonna go up to expand appearance and then i believe it is outline stroke yeah cool all right so now i'm gonna go ahead and make a new version of this file and then open it in photoshop to actually mock it up so i'm going to copy and paste this into illustrator so that's generally like what my lockup is going to look like and then this is going to be pretty much what's wrapping around the packaging and then i'm going to add like all of my other text in photoshop so what i'm going to do is make sure that's like that now i'm going to save this as so i'm going to save that first as an illustrator file and then we're going to go to file export as and then i'm going to save this as a photoshop file so make sure you write your layers don't flatten the image and then i'm going to keep this in rgb because actually no i can't keep it energy because it'll flatten it i'm an idiot so i'm keeping it in cmyk let's go so i downloaded this mock-up i will leave a link for it in the description box i know a lot of people are always looking for some good mock-ups and just like google around a little bit you'll find some good ones i use mockup world and graphic burger but i'll leave both of them linked down below and i will leave this one down below as well so i saved that as a photoshop file so now i'm just gonna open it and it'll just open in photoshop just like that are you kidding me it flattened it let me try that again all right so we're gonna go file export as again photoshop export placing that ah i forgot to click it back i'm an idiot all right i switched to some sprite sprite's all right okay now that that should open normally i do not like that it did that so okay well i guess i gotta do this manually that was a waste of time sometimes this does happen it will flatten my layers even though i say don't flatten so if anyone has a solution to that do let me know now what i'm going to do so it matches these mock-ups perfectly i'm going to open the psb for this and then see the size so 841 by 1386 [Music] okay into that so i'm going to focus just on these elements right now so what i want to do is add a gradient on both of these layers cool i like that let's just turn those back on to kind of see so now it kind of looks like it's like kachow you know um and now i'm gonna go in and do um some more little details so let's save that real quick so i think something that would be cool would be some of the some texture that i could get through the dissolve brush so i'm just gonna go up here and get a relatively soft brush i'm gonna make my size a bit bigger and what i'm gonna be doing is pretty much like painting behind here so you can kind of see that color coming through but i'm gonna set my blending mode for my brush to dissolve so if you look i draw a bit right there you can see this kind of sandy texture which i really do like and i think it can really add some depth so i'm going to do that as kind of like a bit of a shadow underneath here just paint loosely around the edges [Music] and of course that's only under this layer right here so i am going to do another layer that's going to be slightly darker because it'll be a little bit closer to the lemon [Music] i don't know how i feel about that [Music] yeah i think keeping that that brush the same color is better because it looks a little bit lighter once it sits on the the lighter parts of the gradient which i'm kind of into so that's fine [Music] cool i like that so then i can also go in here and set this to a different blending mode oh that's kind of cool maybe i'll add a little bit more it's not too much i think i like that lower the opacity a little bit okay into that so far now i'm gonna work on my lemon right here so i do want to take a similar approach with the dissolve as a way to shade everything so i'm going to do the same thing with my lemon and kind of not do that lower my opacity on that a bit and just kind of paint carefully around the edges to kind of give it some shape [Music] grab this guy put it in a mask so we can kind of see what we're working with not too sure how i feel about that green what if we not a satin overlay of color really [Music] so i think what would kind of be cool here so i did like some lemon lime like flavor writing up here so i'm gonna finish this up and i will show you guys the final product right here [Music] okay guys it's a few days later i needed to take a break i had a few things to do had to go to work you know the same old same old so we're back with a part two for the soda branding so now that sprite is out of the way we can hop over to our lovely friend mountain dew so just pretty much looking at mountain dew's brand this is a very masculine brand to me it's very like dude bro and i i get that it's i don't know when i think of like who drinks mountain dew i definitely think of men and there's something inherently wrong with that but i think my approach that i'm gonna take is going to be something a little bit more feminine just so it could be a little bit more approachable for women or just anyone who's not like a dude bro uh who has like cut off t-shirts and a buzz cut so yeah that's pretty much how i'm gonna do this i already have a general idea of kind of where i want to go with it but who knows like the sprite one we could be completely all over the place and i might change my mind to the end so we'll see so hopping over to illustrator so we're an illustrator so i kind of like already had this color palette picked out for what i tentatively want to work with so it is not so like vibrant neon green and i know that's a pillar to mountain dew's brand but i want to do something a little bit different from the sprite branding since that one did come out so bright so i wanted to do something a little bit more muted a little bit more vintage i hate using that word but you know what i mean so i pulled this font if you watch my recent favorite fonts video um you might recognize this one this is called voltage this one is also available through adobe fonts and i really like it i think something really awesome about mountain dew is its old packaging and just looking at this like i love this hand done feel i love the yahoo aspect to it and then also they had this thing called do shine which i i guess maybe was like their original name or it was maybe a a reinvented throwback thing but i don't know how they went from such a cool hand done brand to where they're at like even this logo that they had like this one is an awesome logo to me i'm obsessed with it i don't know why they abandoned it because that is like a like that is a classic approachable logo versus something like this is like kind of jarring so i wish they kept their old logo so that's where we're at so hopping back over to illustrator this is the approach that i do tentatively want to take so right now i did take the voltage font and i threw a warp on it i'm just playing around with it a little bit because i kind of want it to have this really dramatic m and have it pull up and kind of hug around the do much like they have in the old logo here i like that it's kind of making this weird shape right here so i do want to kind of follow a similar idea for this so i'm going to go to envelope distort warp and see if i can mimic something that's kind of gonna do what i want it to do i'm kind of into that so far i do want to add a little bit of a mountain range right here and maybe like a sun peeking up up here or some sort of cloud iconography i'm not sure but that's i'm kind of like into that so far might be kind of cool to pull some of these swashes out so maybe i'll work with that so i'm going to duplicate this go up to object expand expand it out hmm i'm not really into that never mind scratch that entirely okay so we got this let's go to pathfinder merge and i do want to do kind of like an offset thing that i did that was kind of similar to what i did for my folgers logo and ate that to make it a compound path command ate that to make that a compound bath and one thing that i have been playing with a lot is using the blend tool with a gradient so i will show you what that looks like so we're going to grab these and then we go to object blend options and then i think we want to go smooth color blend make yeah so you can get these these really subtle gradients that look awesome with a lot of type even if like you threw this now on like a solid green background like you can get some pretty cool subtleties in there that look 3d so i think what i'm going to do for this back one is to maybe go a little bit darker i'm kind of into that that's cool see i'll make it a little bit deeper so the cool thing about using the blend tool is that you can just automatically move whatever you need to to just immediately get that effect you don't have to like re-blend anything so i'm copying that top layer and then pasting it in place maybe i wanted that as like an outline i have this i think what i'm going to do now is start adding in no i don't know let me think okay we're going to scratch the blend let me do some undos hold on so you're going to take this go to the pathfinder cut that out and then we're going to paste the other one in place again just going to offset that a bit [Music] i came into those i adjusted those colors a little tiny bit to update my color palette so i think what i want to do now is add in the actual mountains because what would a logo be without mountains you know so let's look at the old one what did they do for mountains okay they have like these rolling hills i think those are cool let's pull some of those i guess they're not really mountains they're just they're semi mountains we're all just like mounds i should call this mountain dew i'm gonna take a similar style to this trace over it all right so they're my mountain hills mountain hill things maybe i'll add in my sun that i never got to add in to my folger's logo see what it looks like maybe it'll look dumb there's a good chance it'll actually look really dumb but we'll try it anyway i think it'd be cool to add something that is reflective of the dew part of it since it is mountain dew like that's due due is water so i think it'd be cool if i could add like some sort of like sheen on top of these mountains here [Music] so i want to add like little things kind of like that like little so i'm just gonna draw one of those again i want it to feel really hand done i could just use like an actual shape tool for this but it's not the approach we're going for today boys and girls because this is hot and fast packaging design that looks dumb pretend i didn't do that okay i'm into that let's try some some cool rays like i tried to do with my sprite and then failed miserably i might look just as dumb so i'm using the circle tool again and i'm going to shift x to switch that to the stroke then we're going to find the stroke option change that to a dashed line and then we're just gonna go to like that's not what i wanted is it this one oh i'm an idiot i do it here kind of into that that's like it looks like a farm maybe not that big yeah maybe it's just like starting to tuck behind the mountain there okay into that into that i think it'll be really cute with some more flourishes on it like if i add some cool little like shiny things on the sun i don't know maybe that'll be dumb let's see i like the idea i don't like how it looks so while we're here let's grab the offset type that i did see if we can work it in here okay so i think that's going to be my tentative logo for now and now my next step is going to be to move it into a packaging format so we can lay it out on a can so let's go do that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys we are back for part three it is a few days later again i have accrued a 100 000 subscriber plaque so that's going to be sitting back here the back of this video for the last section and i'm pretty excited about doing fanta because i've had the most ideas for doing fanta i want this to be really bright and kind of like pop-esque as if it were just like a new seltzer soda brand so just diving into this really quick looking at fanta's label i have this really neat hand done font that is bubbly and kind of flowy it's got this cute little orange in the background similar to what i did with the sprite logo got an orange in the front it just says orange right there it's got this weird little flower thing up here that's strange see if i can get that somewhere up there yeah it says 100 natural flavor so that'll be fun text to work with it's orange soda it's called orange soda so that's cool all right so let's dive into it [Music] let me see that smile [Music] [Music] i'm sorry about that late last night i unfortunately lost my third file that i was working on for fanta so i will do a fanta video separate of this i want to do a full like brand dive and do some really awesome packaging for them so i guess it ends up working out in the end but unfortunately i did lose that file so i am gonna have to recreate it make sure you have your auto save turned on in illustrator if you don't already and just make sure you're saving your work uh because you never know when it's gonna be 1 30 in the morning and you make something really wonderful and beautiful and then your entire computer crashes so cool so i hope you enjoyed watching this i had a lot of fun doing it it was definitely more difficult than the coffee branding one and i think it was partially because i broke it out into a little bit more of like full packaging versus what i did with the coffee was a little bit simpler just throwing a logo on a cup but if you would like to see more videos like this in the future definitely make sure you are subscribed down below and like this video if you enjoyed watching it i know these are long ones but i have a lot of fun making them and also forces you to take it seriously so make sure you head over to them so aside from that that's all i have for you guys today this video took me like a week and a half to film due to all of my technical difficulties and just the chaos of my week i'm about to head over to the airport to fly to new york for the next few days by the time you guys see this i'll already be back so it'll just be a quick trip but i'll be back next week um for some more content i have some really awesome things coming for you guys i'm really excited so thank you so much thank you so so much for 100 000 subscribers i'm so excited to finally have my plaque i don't know where i'm gonna put it in our house but we'll find a good home for it regardless that's all thank you so much for watching and i will see you in my next one bye [Music] you
