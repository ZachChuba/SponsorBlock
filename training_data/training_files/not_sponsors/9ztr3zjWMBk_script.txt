hey what is going on you guys it is mr no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new loot video for you all today so today i bring you guys loot from 3 000 ironworth warriors also known as 3000 elves now these iowa warriors are both male and female and they were released into the game september 20th 2004 at a combat level of 108 most people just think of elves as an annoying slayer task and you know they drop green d-hide and occasionally you get a hard clue really that's the only conclusion that most people would come to about elves in this game i imagine most people actually skip the slayer task you know a lot of people always telling me on stream that they don't really enjoy killing them well ladies and gentlemen i hope this video changes your mind about elves because i gotta say the profit in this one is very very surprising and i hope you guys enjoy the video so with all that being said let's go ahead and get into it so after you complete the quest song of the elves these iowa warriors can also start to be found in the isle worth dungeon usually before the quest song of the elves came out most people just killed elves in the iowa camp just southwest of prith these elves are featured heavily during the regicide quest and if you do complete regicide you can start receiving elves as a slayer task no doubt about it the reason that you want to kill these elves inside the iowa worth dungeon is not only because it's a great location you can use a cannon and it's just really laid back but also because you are able to get the enhanced crystal teleport seed only in this dungeon from these elves and it is at a current price of 2.5 mil so that's really good and on top of the level 3 clue scrolls that we mentioned earlier you know you're always going to be looking forward to getting that crystal drop and the drop rate is only 1 and 1024 so that's not too high at all if you really think about it obviously since i wasn't on slayer task throughout this whole video i was just relying on using max melee the rapier with the fighter hat was really good for stab bonus and accuracy was my main concern so the kills per hour we're looking pretty clean from start to finish i think we're averaging anywhere from 250 to 300 kills an hour with the rapier and the cannon you definitely don't have to bring a cannon here i just enjoyed bringing it because i like the range xp and i'm also trying to get these done as fast as possible so does increase the kills probably by 30 to 40 percent per hour and of course the balls will cost you money but these enhanced crystal teleport seeds are what will make you back that money uh in this clip here you know the price is shown at 2.6 mil and later on in the video you might actually see that crystal go down to 2.4 mils so i'm not too sure if they're actually going down right now but either way it's pretty awesome to get such a great expensive drop from such an easy slayer task i mean these things although they are 108 combat and they are decked out and great looking armor and weapons they really don't hit too high i mean you know you kill every single one of them you get 107.5 slayer xp you don't really need food i mean sgs will get the job done i was also using piety the whole entire time trying to you know max the dps out wouldn't recommend that it's kind of a waste of prayer potions overall this slayer task can be assigned by four different masters them being neve chaldar vanika and duridel a little bit of history on the elves in runescape you know these are the longest living race and glinier and they're noted as being tall graceful humanoids with elongated ears female elves are also renowned for their beauty and speaking of beauty look at this beautiful enhanced crystal teleport seed drop number two into the video and we're not even that far in you know these elves they follow the crystalline goddess siren who journey to glinier with them from their ancestral homeland of tardid these elves have no need for human technology or magic but instead they opt for crystal-based weaponry technology and magic power granted by cyren due to their many years of isolation brought on by their beliefs and a civil war these elves are generally regarded as just a mere myth by humans playing with santa claus somewhere most people who have not interacted with elves in centuries believe that they are long gone and these elves are also known to be associated with a clan each of which originated from the first eight elven families of glinier they have been in many wars the god wars the elven civil war and if there's ever another war i'll use these 11 million cannonballs for my friend here to help these elves out they seem like nice elves you know really nice slayer task as you can see another enhanced crystal teleport seed 7.5 mil ladies and gentlemen and we're not even done yet you know this task really just doesn't get enough credit ever since they moved these elves in this dungeon i really think this task should never be skipped by anybody not only can you get it done within an hour you know 30 minutes flat usually alongside the hard clue scrolls you know the profit is real even if you use a cannon even if you're using piety i mean you can't barrage or burst these things but you know just using max strength and overheads if you want as well if you're lower combat uh really just make this an af cable task and really profitable now you can also bring high alks here and you can hide out the green dehyde body in chaps as well as the mithril spear and kite shield they also drop an adamant full helm and rune dagger always relatable to the green dragon i swear i keep seeing green dragon drops on many of these monsters in this loot series all kills for this video were tracked by rune light and also the bone crusher uh bone crusher necklace 3000 charges means 3 000 kills you guys probably know how that goes by now and if you have a herb sac and a gym bag as well as a seed box i would recommend you bring those uh certainly can help you save some inventory space you may also notice in the bank on the very top tab there that there are crystal shards uh these elves do drop crystal shards and those shards can be used to make a lot of money whether you want to use them for divine super combat potions or actually to make an enhanced crystal teleport seed uh we will of course be stacking up those shards and counting them up at the very end once we do the price check and here's our fourth enhanced crystal teleport seed still going down in price as you can see but very nice to get that the rng is real for this video gotta be honest i did not expect to get this many they also drop normal crystal teleport seeds but those are untradeable and they are common so once i got to 100 of those i just stopped picking them up i don't think they're worth your time but hey i got 100 in the bank if i'm ever going to use them for anything and i know not many lower levels are going to be killing these iowa elves because of the requirements you know the song of the elves quest and all that but if you are lower level they do drop unnoted bass and unnoted sharks so you can always pick those up and eat them you don't always need that ceradoman god sword but i will say it really does come in handy for uh just not needing food or not needing to paint as much and these elves also have five different roles for coin drops so you can bring a ring of wealth it is advised since i was wearing mine i did have increased odds of getting the shield left half drop don't have a ring of wealth on getting a shield left half is a lot more rare but since we had the ring of wealth on it wasn't as uncommon but it's always nice to see those in these loot videos as i was doing the 21 hard clues throughout all these elves i did actually run into some low-level mining roon ore he definitely was a bot and unfortunately i did not kill him but maybe that good karma of trying to take one more botter out of the game got me this enhanced crystal teleport z drop yet again really awesome to see them stacking up i mean at 2.5 mil each we know this price check is gonna be looking pretty awesome this was the fifth one of the video and actually the last one of the video the rest of this was really just uh completing the level three clue scrolls and of course getting all the other drops stacked up for the price check so with that being said loot from three thousand iowa warriors also known as three thousand elves has been completed i did live stream all of this on twitch as i usually do nowadays so big shout out to everyone who is in the twitch chat always nice to do this with you guys it's really fun no matter what monster it is and looking at the price check let's go ahead and do this we have the runes the four runes that they drop the two pieces of food green dehyde and of course all the alks the gems and the unsold heads the insult heads aren't worth that much but this price check overall coming out to be 1.4 million now we go on to the second price check this being all of the herbs as well as that shield left half the three loop keys and the rune javelins that we did get from these elves this price check rounded up does come out to be just about 420k and now before we get into the live commentary with the clue scrolls and all the casket openings hopefully we get some masters there we do have to price check the enhanced crystals and all those come out to be 12.4 million which means if you add up every single one of those price checks we made 14.2 mil from 3 000 elves all in all i spent just about 2 mil or less in supplies which means we made 12 mil profit in less than 10 hours of killing elves that is incredible here we go fashion skate 120k should get up to 700 heart oh there we go first master that's what we'd like to see all right all right had great luck with the uh crystals now we're gonna have some great luck with the masters that sounds good to me all right has to be the reward man thank you jagex you really made me work for that one i don't blame you though can we get out of the master let's hope so pretty damn good odds ooh some num nunchaku huh a little bit of this a little bit of that okay 218k that's great oh we were back in the day when that used to be good all right five more till 700 38k from that one wow 11k 275k all right this will be on seven our 700th hard pretty average where's that master clue we're still looking for it gothic's plate legs some more roon oh zamarock rarely see that sam rock dehyde chops and enchanted robe 424k oh i thought that was great berserker necklace 251k that's not too bad uh overall loot from 21 hearts 2.5 mil all right now it's time for the master gentleman you know it's been a great video 3 000 elves we certainly made a lot more money than i thought we were my prediction for this is either 474k or or a third age uh mage robotim three two one what are we gonna get 8.6 mil that is what i'm talking about this video just got so much more profitable it's not a pet it's not a third age item but it's one step closer very nice i look like a like an ongku like a anku whatever you call them let's go ahead and throw those legs in the grand exchange and see that they sell instantly for that 8.3 mil bonus on top of the 12 mil profit which means we're up to 20 mil and then we add the hard clues and it looks like we made 22.5 mil profit from 3 000 iowa worth warriors now it's also important to note that all these crystals are being sold on screen here and they all did sell for just about two mil each so they are not 2.5 mil at the current day they are two mil also the shard count for this video in total comes out to be exactly 100 we started with 3093 crystal shards and we ended with 3193 so you throw that as a bonus on top of the clue scrolls and the rare i gotta be honest these are a great slayer task probably one of my favorites now of course this was all done off task so if you're doing this while doing slayer you can kill them even faster and that's it for now guys i want to say thank you very much for watching the video uh the clips that you're seeing here is just a little bit of a preview of one of my next videos you know after losing 670 mil on those laryn's keys i actually lost another 500 mil yesterday can't wait to show you guys how that happened anyways i am off i'm going on vacation for the next three days i'll be back on the 25th with a brand new video for you guys until then thank you guys so much for your incredible support mr nose sleep out
