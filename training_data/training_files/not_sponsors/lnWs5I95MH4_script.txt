of a [ __ ] youtube video that's the whole reason people are talking about adrenochrome right now fall of the cabal here's part one and play what i'm going to do is first of all give you a short overview of things that made me go hmm things that made me decide to start digging for the truth wait how many parts of god did it's 10 parts long all right well i guess you gotta watch the whole thing let's start with the recent forest fires for instance in california did you know that these fires forgot to burn trees that they were capable of cutting through houses that they burn trees from the inside out and how about this one we live in a world where mercury is considered highly toxic but not when we inject it into children i'm going to be honest with you guys i'm here from tick tock isn't it weird that the vatican's audience hall is full of references to reptilians snakes serpents my dude made this slide show on a windows 95 computer 9 11 whereas one bird can cause terrible damage to a plane on 9 11 two planes managed to cut through steel i can't take this seriously with the weird faces do you know when something is patented when it's man-made man-made diseases are you kidding me it's impossible to take this series with the cheesy faces keep it professional and get to the point i feel like i pieced together a better video in my sixth grade speech class are you aware of the fact that children cartoons contain subliminal messages of sex and violence why what the [ __ ] does any of this have to do with adrenochrome all right hang on one sec let me just get some clairvoyancy going here [Music] okay it's in part eight the blood of children who were severely traumatized before they died contains adrenochrome yup there it is this woman doing this is brave as hell i'm surprised she hasn't been suicidal adrenochrome is real it is the ultimate drug this is what you look like when you take it and this is when you no longer have access to it thanks to president trump that picture of johnny depp was during a role which he needed to lose weight lol [ __ ] you're [ __ ] gullible there was not as much time between these photos as you may think hang on you [ __ ] nut job look at this that you're showing on screen right now although many humans find participating and observing sexual congress to be both pleasurable and fulfilling i sometimes find it challenging to observe the subsequent removal of adrenochrome from the smaller participants as illustrated in the photograph below damn well that's proof if anyone ever needed it this lady should be a [ __ ] detective the zuckerberg is giving me some trouble there's no way he's actually stupid enough to ever that come the [ __ ] off in the beginning we were asked to do our own research and if you think everything is going to be easy to find remember they own these platforms oh research has determined that the is indeed fake what's your point what research where is your proof that this isn't true she tells you to do your own research not to take her word so where's your proof it's not true oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] hate it i hate it i hate it i hate it all right here's my response damn i knew jk rowling was getting in trouble for saying crazy [ __ ] but i had no idea it was a ten part youtube series that would kill your liver if you turn it into a conspiracy theory drinking game i'm not even mad at this lady for posting your psychotic rantings on youtube because that's what this website is for but i'm definitely upset with you people who watched more than five minutes and were like ah yeah this explains everything you're the reason we need to give teachers more money i hope none of you are parents because those kids are so [ __ ] you'd swear they were locked up in roy moore's basement the act of debunking this piece of [ __ ] would be like solving a where's waldo picture where you finally find waldo he's just showing you his gaping [ __ ] last time i hated a 10-part rambling nonsense [ __ ] [ __ ] stream of [ __ ] consciousness it was that podcast cereal if anybody needs adrenochrome it's this entire comment section you guys are the dumbest bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ] i think i've ever seen on the internet this comment section makes me want to go cold turkey off of adrenochrome so i can age 90 years in five minutes and just turn to dust scrolling down through these comments is like sitting in on a support group for people addicted to traumatic brain injuries you're all stupid hail satan and you're all wrong well except for the adrenal chrome [ __ ] that one's true guy give you that one so anyway that's what adrenochrome is all about it's just the satanic liquid extracted from tortured children that um you know makes johnny depp look 52 years old forever so i mean hey don't don't knock it till you try it [Music]
