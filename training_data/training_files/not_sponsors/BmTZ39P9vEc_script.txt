On the briar-choked road
Blood-red footsteps remain Why does that icy decision
Hurt me so, was it a mistake Ooh no, this sweet scent
Bright ruby drops draw me in Ooh no, lead me more into temptation Yes, your scent your color
Infuse me with pleasure Callin' me Callin' me Callin' me 
The world inside me crumbles Glittering crystal Nearer, nearer, nearer
Until my lips desire your red allure Come & Dance with me Dance the fiery dance, starlight shines in me Translucent glass beads glowing red Don’t look back, don’t let yourself worry In the sweet darkness the witching hour descends We O wow wow wow wow
We O ya ya ya ya We O wow wow wow wow
Infusing with color all my grey decisions Nothing, no words can stop me here
Past my fingers and lips streams of red nectar fall Dizzying scent draws me near
I like it, I like it, more I like it all Callin' me Callin' me Callin' me
The world inside me crumbles Glittering crystal Nearer, nearer, nearer
Until my lips desire your red allure Come & Dance with me Dance the fiery dance, starlight shines in me Translucent glass beads glowing red Don’t look back, don’t let yourself worry In the sweet darkness the witching hour descends We O wow wow wow wow
We O ya ya ya ya We O wow wow wow wow 
Infuse with color all my grey decisions There’s no turning back when the night turns restless
Let the festival I dared to imagine come alive Dream the red dream, endless and deep
Let rise the shimmering light of destruction Don’t agonize, let go the timid child
Take me, the endless witching hour descends We O wow wow wow wow
Dance, dance We O ya ya ya ya
The stars rise, rise We O wow wow wow wow 
Dance, dance Infuse with color all my grey decisions
