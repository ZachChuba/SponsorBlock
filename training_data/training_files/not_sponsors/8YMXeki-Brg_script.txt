this video is sponsored by Squarespace Mira Mira show her to me show me the princess perfect welcome back to 26 frames of spooked Ober there is a debate amongst the world a debate that doesn't reach a level as much as which High School Musical is the best but it is pretty close in terms of arguments the debate I'm talking about is which scooby-doo is the best one is it scooby-doo 2002 or scooby-doo 2 2004 which came out two years after scooby-doo 2002 I know how I say High School Musical 2 is the best in series and the greatest sequel ever made well scooby-doo 2002 is the best non sequel ever made it is the best first movie in a franchise and the best in the franchise itself I know this will spark controversy philipdefranco will make an entire video called why people are freaking out about 24 frames of Nick and it's because of these controversial words scooby-doo 2002 is better than scooby-doo - I asked on my Twitter which was the better movie and luckily a few of you knew the right answer but there were some naysayers how does it feel being wrong scooby-doo 2002 is live action movie that came out in 2002 based on the enemy of the same name scooby-doo was a marvelous show where this gang known as the Rey Mysterio gang would travel around the world solving many myths and crimes where people believed ghosts ghouls or monsters were involved the show was a banger so naturally a live-action adaptation was produced to make a big spanking successful pay cheque at the box office the movie was shot in the land down under and received monumental praise from critics lame jokes [ __ ] you how can you say this joke is bad mary-jane like that is my favorite name yeah you get it it's it's because he loves the devil's lettuce the main characters of scooby-doo are shaggy Fred Velma Daphne and scooby-doo himself re watching this movie from my childhood I was blown away by how genius this movie can be and I'm actually talking serious right now the set design and locations in this movie is honestly really cool and extremely iconic every location just sticks in your mind the entire movie takes place on spooky island you're costly going around different places on the island where you can't even tell where the [ __ ] you are anymore but it is so much fun and works wonders for pacing the characters are all basically faithful to their original cartoon counterparts but Shaggy steals the show in every scene he acts like he was straight-up ripped out of the cartoon itself my immersion watching this movie was furthered too when I found myself eating a burger and Shaggy was holding one in his hand my mind was blown let's dive into the original and better movie and see how it still holds up so the film begins with a classic Warner Brothers logo except it's very cheeky Lee switched out for Scooby Doo's dog tag we follow the game undergoing when there are classic mystery solving adventures and the first five minutes are basically just to get every single homage and inside joke from the original cartoon out of the way every single classic line is pretty much spoken here it's not our fault you always get kidding I do not always get kidnapped and we see the very classic costumes for a moment before they're ditched later in the movie because they look like actual dog [ __ ] in real life the game gets a little frustrated with each other they each debate on which high school musical is the best and Shaggy is just like you know why can't we all enjoy all of them which is [ __ ] stupid so the gang breaks up within the first five minutes let me tell you that this was a perfect move to have the first live-action scooby-doo movie instantly having the classic gang not be a gang coming out with that Redemption story this quick is ballsy so the gang splits up but it turns out that a hold two years later each of them are asked to visit the spooky island to solve a mystery y'all get parent trapped of the airport and [ __ ] Scooby dresses up like an old lady and it's weird it's weird because the movie makes it seem like every single kid is attracted to this dog dresses lady they all get on the plane to head straight to the island and shaggy meets Mary Jane the girl with the name of wheat the entire interaction here is incredible because this girl starts eating dog treats out of the blue and shaggy is just like holy [ __ ] let's have babies just imagine someone sitting next to you eating dog treats Freddy flick Scooby so in return scooby kills fred when everyone arrives on the island we are greeted with a great legend himself goddamn Rowan Atkinson aka mr. bean it kind of saddens me that he's very underused in this movie but simply having him exist in this movie multiplies the quality of this movie to beyond anything this scooby-doo to have Rowan Atkinson I think not [ __ ] so mr. bean tells the gang that the kids on the island all act very strangely by the time they leave and they want the group to find out why so later that night Velma attends some ritual on the island and we meet some very evil looking guy and a goddamned luchador what the hell's going on so the ritual is apparently a real ritual but we don't know that till later on so it cuts Scooby hanging out with some nice bar and we get a generally funny line it's a stupid line but [ __ ] I'd love it Scooby yeah Melvin do what a guy but we think the Daphne who finds some guy cooking chicken and she hates that because she's vegan and then we cut back the Scooby who goes through nearby forest and comes across the first monster in the movie now let me tell you right now that these monsters are terrifying these skinny ass demonic creatures stuck with me so hard growing up something about the very terrible early 2000 CGI actually benefits the design of the creature even more in making it more further from reality like I just [ __ ] hate these things so Scooby runs away from the monster and runs to Shaggy and screams of what he just saw but of course shaggy doesn't believe him they didn't go to check out a nearby closed-down amusement house and the rest of the gang starts to arrive as well in this house I get attacked each in their own way leaving for Shaggy and Scooby to get consumed by gross genitalia and well [ __ ] die meanwhile Fred and Velma come across a very weird IKEA training video hey and Daphne comes across the Allspark when Scooby and Shaggy escape the genitalia they come across a TV set and we get a very artful 10-minute scene or the two just burp and fart over and over and over and over again I'm gonna cry this is too powerful so the whole gang researches everything they've learned so far whatever it was I don't really know and Velma gets wasted on that hard [ __ ] and tell some random guy about the time they left scrappy-doo on the side of the road that'll be very important in the finale so remember that while everyone is at this bar it gets [ __ ] rated like Coke wackety livestream and monsters come in killing everyone and kidnapping them Fred [ __ ] dies so does Velma the entire imagery of these creatures dragging lifeless bodies is just holy [ __ ] so saggy Scooby Daphne and Mary Jane are the only ones that survived last night's raid except it weirdly enough they weren't so we then get an entire scene that involves god damn Sugar Ray more like sugar how much closer to 2002 can you get then Sugar Ray [Music] sugar gay and then we find out fred is still kickin it with the homies and I thought but never mind they're all full of gas so we get a chase sequence where Tony Hawk's Fred's on his belly and it turns out that Mary Jane is actually a demon just check out that incredible tracking on her demonic eyes they escape the gassy people and arrive at a ritual area from the start of the movie shaggy and Scoob get in a fight because shag man doesn't believe Scoob about Mary Jane being a demonic girl [Music] so Scoob falls in the hole shaggy dives in right after him and comes across a pool of souls from Hercules so shaggy sends Fred and Velma souls back to them as well as Daphne because she died too and Fred gets a little creepy hey I can look at myself naked but eventually each soul goes through the right body and they plan to rescue Scooby because he got captured by Mr Bean who turned out to be the villain kinda so Scooby is about to be sacrificed and shaggy helps that happen and we just stare at Scooby's lifeless corpse for a bit it's weird that they just freeze framed on that in the actual movie I never remembered that Scooby's soul [ __ ] up some machines and he comes back to life and we find out that Mr Bean is actually scrappy-doo the image of mr. bean getting his face ripped off is something I will never forget so Scrappy's plan was to absorb all the souls and become bigger so he can star in inglese Hulk movie meanwhile Daphne is pulling some badass moves on the luchador from earlier atop and she'll it's in some sunlight with a hard K Oh Scrappy's plan is foiled within two minutes and the mystery of spooky island is solved I guess the plot of scooby-doo is just kind of all over the place and very very vague at times in terms of explanation but you know what so what it's a fun movie it's bad really bad but the energy never stops it's better than the second movie because of many things mr. bean for instance is one the pacing in this movie is at breakneck speed and the overall energy is just beyond cheesy and adorable it's hard for me to look at this movie with a cynical eye just because of how stupidly I can smile at the Camp eNOS of it all I mean if you really believe the second one is better let me know in the comments below because the only good reason I could find was this one you can't really get another movie like scooby Doo 2002 anymore it's really adult at times and doesn't hold back on batshit stuff and the entire motivation prescribed we do is very underdeveloped and strange like they just kicked him out at one point and then he comes back and just wants to eat scooby-doo and then what what is his plan he just wants to eat Souls and get big and just get big like what else but you know it's it's stupid and I enjoy stupid I really enjoy stupid the scooby-doo movies out now look like this so just forget the new ones exist and just remember the classic the real star of the entire movie is shaggy his entire performance makes up for the very iffy writing and I'll never get over that damn immersion Burger moment I feel like I connected with him and that's why I thanks for Squarespace for sponsoring this video thanks to my boy alpha media for his wrong opinion on which scooby-doo is better follow me on Twitter and scream at me why I'm wrong or support me on patreon and give me money for my wrong choices because YouTube is very unreliable and pet your dog today in honor of Scoob if this video gets 10,000 likes I will throw at my cat and get a dog because dogs are better [Music]
