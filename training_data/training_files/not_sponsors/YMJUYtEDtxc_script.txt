thunder more on that later hi i'm griffin johnson the armchair historian today's video north africa 1940 before we start I want to give a quick shout out to Bing coughs battlegrounds if you're a fan of modern military history we highly recommend you check out this channel we're excited to announce that this video marks the start of our new mini-series on the North African campaign this often disregarded theater of war was of huge importance encompassing the struggle for vital oil fields critical trade routes and the port cities that the Allies would eventually use to liberate Italy first a little background when benito mussolini rose to power in 1922 he began to pursue one of his primary albeit not so realistic goals the resurrection of the roman empire mussolini recognized that this would be a long and arduous process as both Italy's industrial capacity and military were in no position to compete with the European superpowers of Great Britain and France the British in particular represented a significant obstacle in that they controlled both the Suez Canal and Gibraltar the only waterways connecting the Mediterranean to the Indian and Atlantic oceans this provided Britain with the single most efficient means of transporting goods from South Asia to Europe if their British lost the Suez Canal naturally they would suffer a huge blow to trade and colonial management when Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles the Italians felt confident enough to invade Ethiopia in 1935 which put them even closer to the strategic waterway in Egypt the Italians could not openly declare war on Britain just yet but in 1940 they saw their moment after German troops entered France Mussolini promptly redirected forces in West Libya to mass on the Egyptian border before we get into the details of the ensuing military campaign we should spend a minute talking about the tactical aspects that made this campaign so fascinating before it commenced the desert war in northern Africa was sometimes referred to as a tactician stream there were a lot of lofty ideas about how the flat and mostly featureless terrain would provide a sort of real-world chessboard where military theory about mechanized warfare could be put to the test some military planners even believed that the open country would allow tanks to glide around like warships on the open ocean that is the plot of a fantasy novel not the reality of combat in world war ii food water and gasoline had to be hauled over large distances in enormous quantities to even begin to meet the combatants needs historian patty griffith sums it up well writing north africa was such an unforgiving environment in these and many other ways that every mile traveled required a mechanical effort equivalent to well over 2 miles traveled in northwest europe and of course in north africa there were many more miles to be traveled now let's get back to the front line expecting a quick German victory against the Allies Benito Mussolini wanted quote a few thousand dead to gain a seat at the negotiating table therefore his instructions to marshal Rodolfo Graziani governor-general of the colony in Libya and commander of the Italian 10th army were as brief as they were unhelpful attack the British in front of you brows eonni who had earned the nickname of the butcher of the desert [Music] hesitated to go through with Mussolini's very elaborate plans in early September of 1940 he was short on equipment and British hit-and-run tactics cost him nearly 3500 men while the Royal Navy harassed his supply ports at Benghazi and too broke by mid-september Graziani was forced by Mussolini to make his move and actually managed to penetrate 100 kilometres into British territory portions of the Italian 10th army totaling 80 thousand of his 250,000 men got as far as the city of sidi behrani in northwest egypt which they captured on September 16th unfortunately for the bumbling butcher that was when all of those logistical issues that I mentioned earlier really caught up with him Roz eonni ended up spending more than two months waiting for resupply a period that the Allies mockingly referred to as his sits Krieg and while Graziani was trying to get organized his enemies were successfully doing just that Sir Archibald Wavell who commanded the British Army in the Middle East had thus far been bluffing quite successfully Italian forces in the north consisted of around 250,000 men and in the south 350,000 Wavell had just 86,000 under his command it was only through a number of elaborate ruses including inflatable dummy tanks and false tracks that he was able to hold the Italians at bay with more material and manpower freed up by the victory at the Battle of Britain Wavell decided it was time to stop using balloon tanks and start using real tanks under the command of Major General Richard O'Connor plans were made for an offensive codenamed Operation compass just before dusk on December 7th the British 7th armored and the fourth Indian divisions set out for the Italian front line for days the advance continued undetected by Italian forces on the 9th II British Western force ambushed the Italian garrison at Nabila taking approximately 2,000 prisoners despite Graziano's overwhelming numerical Vantage O'Connor consistently brought more tanks to any given engagement by massing his forces together against Graziani 'he's spread out defensive perimeter within days Graziano's frontline was broken and he quickly ordered a retreat back to Bardia in libya just three days after the start of Operation compass Italian forces were completely withdrawn from Egypt and O'Conner pushed on despite their victory the British military suffered significant setbacks during the pursue the 7th Armored Division suffered a critical loss of vehicles and the fourth Indian Division was sent to garrison Sudan being replaced by the more inexperienced sixth Australian division nonetheless O'Connor was able to capitalize on captured Italian vehicles and fuel to move forward when he arrived at Bardia on December 27th he found it well-prepared protected by mines barbed wire machine-gun nests and anti-tank ditches constructed along a 30 kilometre defensive line with his fresh Australian troops taking point he launched his assault the attack was heavily supplemented by air attacks by the RAF and bombardment by the Royal Navy's Mediterranean fleet On January 5th the town was occupied by the British and two-thirds of the Italian 10th army had been killed or captured promptly after this victory the 7th Armored Division cut off 2 Broke and the Australians came to lay siege by late January the Italian garrison of 25,000 surrendered the remainder of Graziano's 10th army retreated as fast as it could with the British in hot pursuit running almost entirely off of captured gasoline when the Italians were close to escaping the grasp of the 7th Armored Division a detachment of mechanized vehicles was sent out to race ahead of the Italian 10th army at bethe fom Italian forces heading from Benghazi were ambushed and stalled by this which bought enough time for the rest of the British tanks to arrive in Stephen W Sears book desert war in North Africa he writes this in two months O'Conner had advanced 500 miles with a force never larger than 30,000 men he had taken 130,000 prisoners 380 tanks and almost 850 pieces of field artillery his total casualties came to just over 1900 after the defeat of the Italian Army the British government confident that there would be no counter-attack anytime soon relocated most of the British troops stationed in North Africa in an attempt to hold off an axis invasion in Greece but all this time across the sea Adolf Hitler had been keeping a wary eye on the repeated defeats of his allies with about as much faith in Mussolini's strategic mind as was probably warranted he dispatched one of his most gifted generals a man who had distinguished himself as a tank commander during the invasion of France that man who was Irwin Rommel and he brought with him a reckoning now a word from our sponsor online battles on
