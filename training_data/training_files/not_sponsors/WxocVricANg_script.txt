[Music] make no mistake the 2019 MacBook Pro has the same design as the 2016 we've got the same slim aluminum unibody chassis the same 2880 by 1800 Retina display the same massive force touch trackpad the same love it or hated touch bar and those same for Thunderbolt three ports that gave us the nickname dongle book pro this on the other hand is my macbook pro i bought it back in 2011 and it's been my daily driver ever since its obsolete now but I haven't really had a reason to upgrade because most of the improvements to date have come at some costs expandability thermal performance speed even the keyboards reliability and this generation looks no different but let me tell you books can be deceiving and if you're tired of being deceived repairs use offer code LTT dad at the link below to save 25% [Music] what's different about the 2019 MacBook Pro then well we'll get into the one engineering change that actually surprised even me and actually matters but first the change nobody is surprised about and didn't matter the keyboard this is Apple's third design iteration on their low profile butterfly switches in an attempt to keep dust and debris from breaking the stupid thing but even Apple admits it's not trustworthy because the 2019 MacBook Pro was actually listed in the keyboard service program the day it dropped that's when you know it's bad to me the keys themselves feel a little bit more spongy and this isn't a bad thing because it makes the travel feel a bit more pleasant and deeper than it otherwise might it's a very subtle effect though and it might just be my mind playing tricks on me all I know is I've never been a fan of the feel of the butterfly switches and I found typing on this one touch more pleasant overall but now it's time to dig a little deeper because while our MacBook Pro 2019 may not be equipped with the best factory GPU options as it's better for a number of reasons to use an e GPU it is equipped with the highest end CPU Apple offers the 8 core 16 thread core I nine ninety-nine a th K which has a claim to boost of up to five gigahertz and a base cloth barely lower than its six core predecessor actually before I move on I just want to talk for a second about these boost clocks because they're not boost clocks as we know them they're actually what Intel calls thermal velocity boost TLDR what these numbers represent are boost clocks on top of boost clocks only achievable under extremely strict thermal and power criteria only while normal boost is active and only on a single core so when you're doing actual work you'll probably never see the advertised numbers to be clear Apple isn't to blame for intel's marketing spin and they aren't the only ones who are advertising their computers this way but I'd really rather laptops be graded based on the frequencies they can actually hit rather than what's on Intel's Ark website but I digress coming back to the MacBook I was skeptical about its performance because it has more faster cores than the 2018 model but it has the same TDP and that model is famous for thermal throttling to the point where we even expressed concern over its longevity and long term data integrity due to its reliance on the t2 security chip which is still present here so I wanted to test it against the 2018 but I also wanted to see how it would compare to a similarly SPECT PC as many have claimed the same chip in a different form factor would perform better and in fact we've shown that a MacBook can attain higher performance by placing an energy chiller box unfortunately there are no pcs with this exact chip right now but I did find the ROG Strix car 3 rocking the quote 4.8 gigahertz core I 998 ATH well that's supposedly a touch slower the scar has a much better cooler so it should boost for longer and throttle later if at all compared to the MacBook but here's what surprised me thermals actually look better than 2018 that's a good 6 degrees cooler than last year's model and supposedly we're looking at CPUs with the same TDP here clearly they're just throttling right nope check this out under a full prime95 small FFT workload the 2019 model is sitting pretty at 2.6 gigahertz nowhere near it's all core boost at 4.2 but still higher than its base clock and faster than both the 2018 MacBook Pro and the SCAR 3 can maintain even with his limiters off what okay did they change the cooler or something no so I reached out to Apple to find out how they did it but as usual they took one look at the email and sent it straight to the trash but I have my own theory one I think they've upgraded the thermal interface material between the cooler and the chips and two I think they pulled off some pretty heavy under bolting in Mac OS I'm sure enough when I fire up the same workload under windows in boot camp we get much higher temperatures overall and we end up thermal throttling well below base clock after only about a minute so at least one part of my theory is confirmed but you don't buy a Lambo commuting and you don't buy a Mac your own windows on it so I guess I can give them a pass here just bear in mind as we move on that bootcamp performance will be a lot lower than Mac OS due to the under bolting alone speaking of things you don't buy a Mac for gaming at 1440 by 900 our MacBook Pros Radeon Pro 560 X doesn't fare too well but we get decent results in cs:go compared to the same GPU on our 2018 model so that's something more importantly though when we move on to productivity holy crap is that Cinebench score a 900 point gain over 2018 from for extra threats that's nearly a 30% uplift and right on with the better cool scar Geekbench has a straight up murdering the scar in Mac OS with the obvious exception of the GPU but it's also worth noting the extra oomph of the 20-19 muddles GPU gains over last year even though it's the same GPU hinting at that better Tim blender meanwhile sees a 35 to 40 percent improvement in performance with the 2019 even beating the scar and shaving a whole six minutes off the classroom test over the 2018 MacBook Pro the v-ray gives us a slightly more modest but still respectable improvement over all right in line with the scar 3 and finally luxe mark gives us more of that delicious GPU performance uplift we've been seeing so much of content creators will be happy to know that Adobe Premiere also gets an improvement over the 2018 and Final Cut Pro 10 gets a bump to saving nearly a minute and render time over 2018 finally for you Deb's out there are Mozilla Firefox compiled tests the 2019 is dominating here to saving nearly 9 minutes over the 2018 model and whether it's because of the tool chain or the more aggressive clocks and Mac OS nearly as much over the SCAR 3 now to be clear there would be a significant performance uplift with a better cooler but a MacBook is a complete package that doesn't change very often and I really can't overstate how impressive these results are given the thermal performance of the previous generation I'd personally prefer a lower thermal target with some Headroom built in to let it turbo up a little bit more but we're far from sustaining a hundred degrees like last gen did we've said before that Apple has some good engineers over there and I think they've earned their pay the time around as for whether or not it's going to replace my 2011 well let's just say it's a strong contender and you know today at drop comm we're gonna have that linked in the video description thanks for watching guys if this video sucked you know what to do but if it
