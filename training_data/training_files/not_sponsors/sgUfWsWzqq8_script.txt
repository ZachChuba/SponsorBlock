grind into um crystal dust that i can then make into uh divine super combat parts to make bike i think this is my 15th master clue 16th not too good just brought my slayer helmet back i haven't done any slayer since i got cleaned so this is one of my last imbues i had to do at this point in time my bank value is 80 mil [Music] damn i think i'm going to have a thousand shards after this yes that's amazing i could make an infinite blade of zelda but i i unfortunately you can still revert it so i would still have to stake it with the short grind to 93 her blood on the way it's time to hop on the

been bobcats taverley twinks patadermas party boys and my team the zanarasumas the rules of the bingo are very simple complete all the complete everything on the whole the whole board the whole board needs to be completed the winner gets a million it's day one of bingo and i've decided to tackle the most thrilling and exciting tile the two mil mining experience okay that's it i'm going to stop i did it about 200k xp let me see if i got a pet actually because that would be nope my skilling division leader paddy is a keen volcanic mine gamer so he's going to clear up the rest of this tile at volcanic mine while i go and do some pvm zara is probably one of the longest tiles on the board getting all four uniques done in a short period of time is no easy feat i am slacking in the wealth department though and i'm a bit behind by my own standard so hopefully i can make some money at zoro i'm sure you will the zoomers again i better finish this utah today oh i got tan spanx i said no and i got the transfer one out of four [Music] oh my god yeah i just got another one another one no another unique though on it oh what get in day one of the bingo and i'm actually rolling in cash i my bank is probably over 100 mil now and yep i got two units done for the tile and it's oh 86 oh that's disappointing no more don't worry tom from the past you have 1 500 shots that's going to make your bank 100 mil nice we're over 300 kca corrupted gauntlet now later that evening i went to corporal beast with my bingo team we got an elixir on the first kill there was no video because i didn't even get the recorder up in time the next day i decided to take on the most put up tile i do not like this place i don't think many people do though well i say i don't like it it's there's some fun moments for sure please spare me i'm not gonna lie i don't think i'll ever come back here not even on my iron man i'd rather just hit callisto with like a varric bopper i get it now sorry i'm so small brained 100 kc just so i can have a bit of time to oh my god we just got a hill oh that's so pogba's bro it's day three of the bingo and things are looking very good for the zener assumers we're

designated bandos driver oh you're doing it hey great oh my god no way oh my god oh four hour 20 minute bandos trio trip it's been a while since i've knocked out one of those uh still really nice

and now our team's dead last and doesn't even look like we have any chance of coming back yep black demons i need uh two uniques from those i stopped doing black demons after one trip because i'm

listen yeah if i if i ever catch you slipping on last night i'll [ __ ] you up excuse me i've exiled my pvp ego it's time to go back to player versus monster okay i didn't get a unique that task but i still made like three mil or so from the alcohols and stuff uh sorry i had to blur out my clan chat there people are talking about [ __ ] ah good news my friends my bank value i think yep bang on 100 mil uh that's really good considering i've had to spend a lot of money making um potions for herblore still have all my shards too so with the potions that i make uh in the near future i think the bank value should be about 120. like free hub coming in i can now make um super defined combat potions if i pot cool here we go do i can i just uh all of them oh jesus part of my blaspheme i just thought there'd be more menus uh i am the tank zanuszuma's unite to take on krill yep go on spear for the i'd fap flying in uncut we're currently third out of four but um i think today we could we

the rings bruv i didn't but i got three out of four rings for my bingo event let's have a look 6.4 mil nice oh that's so good that is a whole gorilla's task without a unique sadly no not even a whiff of a spring i'm armada with my friend paddy uh we just have one more god wars you need to go to complete our god wars tile i bought a lot of chains hopefully we don't have to use all of them if i was armadillo right now i would simply just drop my pants it's onerous far great you seed as i said yeah thanks for the confirmation of that one yeah it's just as any of the armor pieces in case you were wondering yeah that's our second one uh so that could have been two armor pieces very unlucky chaps thanks man well tommy's so in sync how many yeah i'm going to do that i'm going to do the pathing for afix and we'll place it on the thing and then you run around the corner and then over the gap check the vent back up check the boulder again that was a long trip i think i started that trip with like 88 casey we didn't get anything but we're going back tomorrow morning that's one in 5k right if tom got the pet it would be fun we've got bingo to do but i think i'd take a creep out i don't know my bank value is roughly 127 mil it's pretty good considering we just spent a lot of money on those black chins i'm gonna make the rest of these divine super combat potions and try and finish the zorro tile god i love a 4am jar of swamp probably can't do another trip got owned there eight just in case oh what moonbound tweet i got a second onyx no i tried to run out of charges oh i just made 11 mil i just died for the first time in a while as well because there's there's been a new death update for a week and this is like the first time i think i'm gonna have to use the like a little grave in my corner look at this legend i just finished my whole dagon of king's trip and i'm afraid to say i didn't get anything wait yeah i did actually hold on oh no i just got a berserkering in full screen i was recording for maybe like a future edit [ __ ] 86 skeletons hmm [Music] i'll take b checkman oh boys dragon pickaxe 18kc yes that's five mil and a tile ticked off ah dude two onyx is two tan spanx now i'm gonna have to leave zoro in a lot of profit but i'm not gonna be able to complete the title because i've only got 40 hours left of bingo and i think everything's going to rely on this last chambers of cerec tile pretty much as it stands if any team gets an ancestral piece or a prayer scroll they're going to win the whole event yeah so you can't predict what he's going to do but what he's done recently he's more likely to do again so if he's just arranged you pray reigns because he's more likely to do range again yes no way [Music] they've won they've won i thought they won there she didn't the better been bobcats ended up winning wedges managed to pull an all-nighter at zoro and he managed to get all 4 uniques what a beast 11 mil split that should put me close to 160 mil bank oh a weapon seed all right that's it that's a that's a unique it's the worst unique but you know 240 crats thank you what the [ __ ] i hit three zeros in a row are you joking jesus that

seat nice what up pimps my bank value is now 200 mil because i've done a serious amount of corrupted gauntlet still no blade but that's okay i'm getting closer to my 400 kill count goal okay five minutes five minutes 400 kill count at the corrupted gauntlet let's see what we get from the last kill i'll do in a while i don't think i'll come back here now until i get cleaned again honestly i
