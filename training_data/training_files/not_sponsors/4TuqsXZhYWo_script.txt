and technically you need a hacked ps4 with a modded firmware it has to be on uh you know welcome today we're hanging out with oroboro and chase hello boys hello hello we're following on from the dark souls boss vs boss series this time a new channel reached out to me called garden of eyes of course with a name like that you know it's got to be a bloodborne channel shout out to sanodisk the owner for setting this up links to the channel will be in the description like the last lo-fi playlist and so on now on with the video so the first one is called the ultimate war of the great ones garden of eyes recommended this one to start with himself i can see why yeah this looks pretty epic i mean so these are all these are awesome the big eldritch horrors of bloodborne right the multi-dimensional beings uh cosmic entities yeah orphan of course at 30 000 hp ebrietas daughter of the cosmos 23 000 mergo's wet nurse 24 000 hp oh there's the moon presents 14 000 moon presents has the least hp so far rom the vacuous spider 12 000. oh no ron does actually yeah an amygdala or a mcdollar however you say it 26 000. i don't have a guess but like i feel like it's going to be hard to hit amygdala just because of the hippo oh i have two like massive questions already though first of all surely rom's gonna just get clapped that's what i was thinking yeah like his little spiders aren't gonna do much yeah does he even have his little spiderlings what they called like yeah his best friend he's just kind of standing there right now so you know i don't great one defeated virgo dead already damn okay wow i didn't even see it happen doesn't the um doesn't the moon presence haven't have an aoe attack where it puts everything to one health yep how big is the aoe though i don't know if that's gonna happen yeah i don't know if it does honestly my my money's on wrong no way because you know what i think he's just chilling yeah wow orphan of paul is getting destroyed yet yeah british is the most opie honestly is rom already dead or is he still there because he's chilling in the background he's just he's just chilling wow oh oh oh okay well a breed is holding her own coss is dead wow moon presents doing work well it's going to come down to one of these two versus wrong this has been so quick they just have such high damage output rom's gonna come off screen for the cleanup yeah wow moon presence actually won everything minus wrong oh oh diddy oh i thought no dead is that a double ko oh no he just won he just lit no he just he's got like one yeah he's got like no hp wow okay yeah bro he's like no it's so cute well he's just gotta touch him well so rom's really weak to bolt and lightning everyone knows that but um also the thing is though his head's really strong it's his body that's weak and he's kind of facing that's true targets he just needed one hit yeah correct me if i'm wrong does awful of course not have a lightning attack where it's like an aoe thing that spreads out along the water he sure does yeah i feel like some other moves they're not using just because of the enemy placement maybe hmm wait wait wait wait what wow amygdala dead so quickly i didn't even really i didn't even see what killed her i wonder if mergo's wet nurse will use that like fog attack where she gets a clone that would be interesting that would be cool for this yeah that'd be really cool that would be really cool i haven't seen it yet like how the moon presence just finished that with a like the the light beam attack in the last round it's kind of op yeah i wonder wait is ram already dead this time or did he uh cower away whoa he's the underdog oh mergo's then yeah yep and okay we have the moon presence and every house presence is looking real low right now is orphan of course still there orphan of course is still there yeah he's hiding right behind there he is orphan of cost has really high damage and good health look at look at his hp still more than half oh man i think a prietus is done i think koss is winning this one yup yeah and orphanage just died too oh wow so that's the moon wow and this is wrong oh no the faith will come back it feels so bad you know what though you know if he just touches him he'll die like why hasn't he he's not putting out any moves maybe he needs to get to his second or third stage where he starts doing the arcane attacks but he dies too fast to do to get to those stages i think oh maybe that's why well if he doesn't use the lightning attack again oh oh no he didn't he did the scream that was the end wasn't it so best of that was best of two we've had two separate winners moon presence and ebrietas hmm wait dude i could see either one of them taking this wait did did moon presence win the first one no everybody oh oh i was confused i'm pretty sure yeah everybody yeah this one yeah no definitely definitely yeah it's one one yeah we oh that you see that that was the one shot thing yeah i was gonna say what if he did that right at the beginning of the match oh it was it was it was yeah yeah oh lazy doing it again dude op oh but it didn't it didn't work you say op i mean one of them has an attack that puts anyone near them to one hp like yeah that's that's the op move oh is that what you're talking about yeah that's what it's talking about yeah so amygdala is weak only in the head i believe i feel like the moon presence is the only one that can really get up there maybe oh there it is did you see that 83 000. that's ridiculous ridiculous what the hell is this if it just so happens that move is brought out at the beginning yeah i mean i thought the moon presence only did there at that attack at like 50 health but maybe not i think i think i think they were at fifty percent oh yeah that attack is so strong also though damn that's ebrietus's call of call from beyond or something like that it's called isn't it yeah exactly the arcane homing missiles don't really dodge yeah yeah they just yeah i think the only one that's kind of dodgy just because he's jumpy yeah oh he might win yeah i can never tell man it looks like it already looks like a british is dead oh yes he died yeah he dunked him yeah he'd avoided the attack with that jump yeah he did that he's gunking on him she's dexterous dude oh no wrong run run run oh my god do your arcane meteorite oh he's actually doing something oh but oh my god yo maybe because it's physical attacks this is better you know oh maybe he's getting his friends now yeah yeah maybe the spiders will come out oh god oh he's doing something what's this okay oh friends okay oh he's getting real low though yeah he has a few arcade attacks in the second and third stages so is this his third stage yeah it has to be it's like one third hp i believe it i believe in rom come on one way wiggle wiggles just do something oh no oh oh oh oh i did look how they massacred my boy they did him dirty well so what we had one cars win in an uh amygdala oh no a burrito and a moon probably that's the end of the video yeah there's one so it's like an awesome a different winner each time yeah that's interesting actually that um match up has the most rng out of any we've seen because of the moon presence yeah it could just one shot any of them decide don't just delete someone from the fight yeah imagine if they're all like near him i was hoping that would happen just everyone did let's go orphan of course how much hp does german have enemy spotted oh he gave him double hp actually big boy his damage output is like lower final boss of the game versus final boss of the old hunters dlc yeah yo but cos has a home field advantage here yeah and and cost is a freaking lunatic yeah yeah look at those dodges though dude yeah he's he's quick dark souls 2 back steps here got those iframes on the forums you see most people like new players complaining about orphan i feel like yeah yeah that's because he's quick with really high damage orphan people quit the game for people who don't know he's beating you to death with his placenta yeah basically and it extends i don't know yeah it's humiliating isn't it i do have to say i appreciate the scythe use though a lot of safe bosses and games rather get beat to death by mundane ladle than that i don't know man german is definitely a fan favorite though oh yeah he's mine he's dapper look at him yeah he's he's suave you know yeah he's gonna come on german get in there brother okay let's just start just deep to the side it's pretty even you're getting beat by a baby [Applause] [Music] they're both really mobile like jumping and leaping around teleporting oh that was quite the car very fast yeah this is quite even it is i kind of think that german will win actually because he's been taking phase two though true but it's kind of easier for him to dodge the jump attacks oh but not that at all the orphan only does the lightning attacks on the water is that correct i don't think so actually that damage boost from second phase though pretty pretty intense yeah we might actually get them yeah that might that might tear them down i mean there are a couple of visceral attempts you could get maybe there we go facebook oh okay yeah that might oh or did it miss yeah it'd be interesting if you got a visceral i don't think he'll go for it though no oh the combo it's the herald curve sword combo oh geez this has given me flashbacks the amount of deaths i've had on this beach yeah oh damn that did a lot of damage dude the aoe is the whole nap it did it actually like continues oh no german pull yourself together it's not looking good for our boy yeah i don't i don't know man i don't believe i don't think so anymore he did have the phase three too strong yeah yeah until facebook yeah he was he was solid yeah this is phase three problems right here and he's just like hyper aggro in this amount of hp you know like he just keeps attacking you can really feel the orphan of course just getting angry and angry he's done it's over jakes yeah he ran away with it at the end yeah he was winning i think until phase three here he's winning and then yeah yeah then he just kind of demolishes damn yeah that was awesome that was good though oh and the lightning don't stop for anybody he's fuming he's attacking the camera he's big mad do you guys not think murgo's witness is just the most disturbing boss fight literally just based on the move say yeah i mean there's that but the whole fight you're hearing the crying from murgo right and then you there's the the crib there and the the lullaby children music yeah it's not the nicest sound yeah no i love it it's such a creepy fight no it's like such a weird feeling fight people always want like epic battle music but then like the horror element of this child like music is yeah that's good yeah [Music] and and the the design of the boss is unreal yeah so cool i love the space oh here's the fog yep there the clone comes out you can see your like the purple blades stabbing you in the darkness yeah look at that it's intense also it's so calm at the same time you know yeah it's weird i've never had a boss fight like this everyone's gonna be mad if we don't talk about maria that's true we're all just like maria's cool too yeah i feel like maria is already mainstream cool though so everyone knows yeah yeah i think she's overrated honestly i mean it's just like a hunter you know it's a cool one and here we go to the comments let's see what the experts think wait oh the shadow clone jutsu yeah i did did did they change the health at all no they're they're normal right yeah yeah i guess the damage output from maria is just higher than what nurse maria has three phases if i'm remembering correctly uh yes honestly these attacks look like they're like missing they are missing merger doesn't have any phases hmm yeah just the starts in her face just the purple mist if that's not your face yeah just you know just breaks up the fight this is weird honestly some of these hits aren't doing oh there we go since i'm doing damage to maria ah maybe maybe strange hitboxes how many blades does the wetness have is it six or eight looks like eight i have no idea one two three oh maybe six it's hard to tell i think it's six looks like six yeah yeah but six they kind of look like the burial scythe don't they now that i oh oh here we go she's going super saiyan she's already winning by the way she's been winning this is uh yeah now she's gonna super win yeah i think they did maybe not maybe not oh no that attack has been brutal yeah it just didn't do enough she does a quicker one than that a quicker oh my lunch yeah yeah they're like bursting into that burritos is more than like the dps of all the swords [Music] hey maybe not she's getting chainsawed on yeah right if that move keeps up and it stuns her baby nothing personal kiddo probably should have put some predictions for that one because i think we would have all got that right yeah yeah the damage is too high battle of the battle of the doggies isn't it yeah which one this is the number one jogger or a fire dog wait wait wait wait wait wait wait restart restart didn't it say his health was like 4 000. wow 4 000 the next one has like 14 000 didn't it say awesome it's because he moved so much yeah holy crap maybe they took into account it's like move set carl's mobile as hell he backs up and dodges everything interesting what i was gonna say is which one would you rather have as a pet probably he's cooler yeah i like electric over fire i like the fire i like the watch dog you like the watch boy he's a good boy carl's like a cat dog almost you can hear it like hissing i'm a cat guy oh i thought that would do more damage that's done yeah me too that guy does have like triple air quadruple hp then i think watchdog is going to win just because parle gets done so easily it does that's a good point that's true he's going to get combos he's got faster attacks though i'll use the fury swipes man i i remember the watchdog of the old lords being faster than this yeah maybe just felt like that because you're in his face and you're small and he's huge yeah yeah science plays for all for sure mike whoa paul's movement have you are you watching our paul moves it's crazy yeah it looks so menacing it's more like a cat yeah for sure yeah i haven't really noticed that before stays like hunched yeah pacing yeah oh miyazaki you so crazy you know what it is the head stays still while it's body while it's legs are moving side to side yeah yeah it's creepy it's like that thing that birds do like their head is always stationary and their like body moves around it it's weird yeah yeah that's yeah imagine if humans did that yeah like some guy was moving his arm with a bird on it and the bird's head was staying still while the body moved it was creepy oh yeah i think i've seen the same video was it an owl yeah i've seen that like i've seen it it was i don't know why maybe it's how they balance okay it's even it's even yeah maybe maybe that's why they balance the hp oh okay oh the boom i'm rooting for my boy paul come on yeah i'm rooting for pyro no way my little shocky boy underdog lightning blade he's killed me too many times in the chalice dungeons to lose redemption look at this you're dead if you get hit like three more times it's not fair come on go on a rampage one more hit one more hit don't touch that lava don't touch the lava don't touch the lava parlor will that kill him after the fact yeah it might if he does it like if he misses it no you missed you missed your fool oh my god you're full no yeah my boy boy my wow that was insanely possible left too yeah did you just see him in the chat gg easy
