We will say hello. 2, 3! Let's say hello
We're fromis_9! (*This shooting was done in compliance
with public health at a quarantine site) We're going to a vacation
home to hang out! (excited) (Another person excited) (Channel_9 EfG)
(fromis_9 between 'End' and 'Go') (The quality of the trip will change
 depending on what they choose!) I'm going to keep this fun - What if I pick 'End' now?
- Then we end it now! I'll keep our dorm ♪ Let's go together ♪ (No idea what's going
on, but excited) We're going to take our first
pick between 'End & Go'! Already? (Shocked) Are we picking the type
of transportation? So we're choosing either 'End' or 'Go'? We're playing individually,
so you take your own pick Pick one each! (Gathering)
I think this is a car Can we 'End' filming? We'll pick between 'End' and 'Go' now! One, two...
(I'll go _______.) ('End' or 'Go') (End: Jisun, Chaeyoung) Wait! Can I switch? - No. No, you can't!
- Hurry! Really? (Angry) (The first choice is...) 'I will not use any electronics
to get to my destination!' Those who picked 'End' are
able to use electronics! (Joy & Sadness)
Oh, I'm screwed No, no. It's okay
(Staying positive) (Teary) It's okay, we have... (Oh, my fan...) Mommy... If you picked 'Go', you can't
even use Bluetooth earphones DJ Chaeyoung! If there's music in the
car, it's okay. Right? Each car has a member who
can use electronics! What a relief Oh good!
I'm normally the DJ I have to talk to my
mom. What do I do? I'll lend you my phone
(Solved) - (Pouts)
- Life is all about 'Go'... Oh! I'm in the wrong spot!
I picked 'End'! (More liars spotted)
Oh, me too!  I'm in the wrong spot I don't really use electronics - I'll steal yours then!
- I usually read in the car (Embarrassed) That was the funniest
joke you ever told That was hilarious (You always read in the car(???) ) (Gyuri trying to replace
Jisun as the funniest) How pretty, Nagyung (Got dolled up)  Nagyung, you picked 'Go', huh? Go!! (Let's 'Go'!) Shall we begin our trip?♥ - Shall we go? Let's go!
(Winners looking relaxed) I already made plans for today! (Everyone turning in their phones) (Can't let go) Don't use electronics! (Someone lost their puppy) fromis_9, hi! (Stretching) ♥ Acting cute! ♥ - Let's go!
- Let's go! (LOVE RUMPUMPUM's intro
makes everyone dance) (Trembling)
 Let's go! Wowwow...wow! It's so quiet - Here?
- Yes (Conquered the world with her beauty
Jiheon★ #1 beauty) I'm going to charge up quietly
and use all my energy later (Gyuri always keeps her word) I don't care as long
as I have my Airpods (Silence) Don't you feel sick reading
in the car? (Worried) I do, but... (*Jiheon had a test
coming up in a few days*) (Look at Seoyeon sleeping looking
like a beautiful sculpture) Jisun Is this right?
(She's asking Jisun what's confusing) Yes. It is What's with the Japanese...
Oh, you're learning it in school, right? (Fast forward x5) Chaeyoung I'm so sleepy. Can you cheer
me up and wake me up? You want me to cheer
you up? Okay! (Request received) Wow!
(100% customer satisfaction) Listening to "GANG" once a day (Comes so naturally) (Dancing machine)
This is so fun Let's go! (Immersed)
♪ Flashing lights ♪ ♪ surround me as I stand on the stage ♪ (Hayoung seems sleepy) I haven't listened
to this in a while - We listen to this a lot
- We sang this yesterday (Happy Clock) Tick-tock In English, it's a watch Tick-tock, tick-tock
(Happy) ♪ I'm happy whenever I think about you ♪ (Excitement at 1000%) (fromis_9 is nothing without their energy) (Protecting our artists) (1 person who keeps sleeping) (1 person listening to music) (Victory) (1 person studying for exam) (1 person actually reading) Gyuri and Jiheon brought books! Stop lying! (Oops, sorry) (Pumping up the crowd again) ♪ There's a lot! ♪ ♪ I'll round you up and cuss you out ♪ ♪ You're bad ♪ Louder! (Stop) - Chaeyoung! What's going on?
- Are you.. Let's go! (Silence) (Lost in music) (Peaceful) (Can't contain the excitement) (Studying nonstop★) (Chewing gum to stay awake) This is so strong (The winner with a phone) (Everyone is enjoying the luxury) (Kisses♥) ♪ I'm on my way to come see you! ♪ (Checking out the camera)
(Takes a peek) (She's the main vocalist indeed) (Hilarious) (Song break for flover) (She's into it) (DJ Chaeyoung picks perfect songs) (Dancing like true professionals★) Here it comes! She says 'I was the only one
laughing, but I had to be quiet' Why? Because everyone else is sleeping - They are?
- All of them are sleeping Whoa. That's crazy
(Can't see, but everyone's asleep) How could they sleep?
 I'm so excited Oh? We're the only ones still up
(All KO-ed) Once again, it's just us two... (Let's have fun even if it's just us!!!) (Doo-doo) I felt something and it
was you doing this (Give me) (LOL) (Give me) (Getting started) (Seductive) (Director:Chaeyoung)
(Camera:Chaeyoung) (Actress: Seductive Jiwon) Aren't you worried about
how it'll turn out? (Doesn't care)
I'm a little afraid (Let's go)
Jiwon! I want to go! (Seductive) Yes, I want to go!
(Passionate director) (Acting seductively) (Super seductive) (Ready to go home) (It's a little too much now) ♪ Let's go to my house ♪ Do it softly~ (Sh) (LOOOL) (Looking around) (Searching) Do you want one?
(Caught on quickly) Thank you... (This feels like home) (Back to sleep) (Taking photos) (Photos) (Jisun shot awesome pictures) Hayoung! We're almost there!
(Wake up) (Everyone's up) (The party must go on) We're going to play
 'End & Go' again soon Which one should I pick? - What?
- Whatever you feel like choosing - Whatever I feel like doing?
- Go with your gut feeling You just pick what
feels right to you How do you feel today? Are you feeling more
 'Go' or 'End'? Me? I'm always a 'Go'! (Move forward in life!) Since it was our first pick,
I wanted to choose 'End' - Really?
- I thought I'd get something bad Really? - I picked 'Go' because it was our first
- Me too (Next mission)
A left-handed person grills meat! - I like that mission
- Right? I'm the only one! (LOL) - That's me
- I like this idea We are here! We're here! We're here! (Jiheon, the #1, is fixing her hair) That was difficult not
being on my phone! Don't you think it was
just like any other ride? There wasn't anything
different in our car (Unbelievable) That was nice!
(Feels better) (Sneaky) (Eye-contact♥) (Hello) (Gyuri just said hello...) Saying hello into the
camera for the first time (Awkward) We recorded for one hour and
22 minutes, right? (Keen eyes) You don't have to watch
the entire video It'll have the same stuff
(LOL) (Finally arrived at the house)
Are we at the top of Mt. Everest? (Sneaky) Wow! What? The view is really nice from here! (fromis_9 will stay here today) Isn't this from 'Full House'? Let me give you a
tour of my house Wow! (Shocked) (Looking everywhere)
I love it! The place has a hammock! (Chaeyoung, the scary cat, enters) Wow! This is crazy! (Skipping in excitement) Hey guys, this is my house Creep (The hammock makes
you feel at home) (Found a fluffy) (After the tour, it's time
for a group decision) 'End' could be the right
choice again You might think that we will
pick 'Go' unlike the last time, but we are not that simple But think reverse psychology.
We might have to pick another 'Go' (Divided)
So we have to think about that and... I think we have to pick 'Go' How about this? (Hayoung, the Solomon appears)
We will spin this fan - and pick
- Okay Everyone, how about this? We'll put this up and see
which way it falls to - We'll try this and go with majority vote
- Okay (Everyone is so cool... ★) It's 'End'! 'End'! Oh, wait! No!
(Rushing) I want to pick 'Go'
(Whining) I have a bad feeling
because a fly sat on 'End' A fly sat on 'End' Whose fan was it? It was mine (Snatches) I think it just wanted
to sit on your fan! - I want to pick 'Go'...
- Okay But I don't have any confidence in it Saerom has bad luck
 Go with 'End'! - What do I do?
- Wait! Nagyung, what about you? - I want 'Go'!
- Let's pick 'End' (LOL) Let's 'go' with 'End' then! Who won in the first round? - Chaeyoung and Jisun
- Which one do you want to pick? (Firm)
'End' (Guessing) I think this will
be about sleeping arrangement - This place is big
- Do we have to sleep together? I want to sleep however I want!
(Teary) There is an easier way to do this You be 'End' and you be 'Go' You do rock, paper, scissors
and we'll go with the winner Rock, paper, scissors! ('End' won) 'End' was the right choice Okay. 'End'!
(Don't look back) One, two, three
(We will sleep ____.) (Final decision: End) Wait! (fromis_9 suddenly in a panic) (The phrase was 'we will
sleep freely as we want'!) (But 'End' means everyone
sleeps together) I told you!
 I told you to go with 'Go'! (In despair) If we don't pick a room,
where do we sleep? (Serious) (You'll sleep in the room
 we designate ^^!) Is she a monkey? Huh? (Teary) I said the fly sat on it! I'll take the hammock
(Act fast!) You're going to wake up
looking like a waffle (LOL) Oh, you're going to
look like a pigskin Is that what you're
worried about? Wait. What can we do to
make a deal with you? - Hayoung! Don't we have bad backs?
- Ouch - I only have one eye right now...
- She is contagious (Teamwork) Listen, everyone! Grab the back of your neck! (They've got the best teamwork★) Wait! Everyone! Listen! Let's hear out the staff
members and see what they want - How about 'Cham-Cham-Cham'?
- Right. 'Cham-Cham-Cham' That game is random
(Shocked) (LOL) It's too random!
(Worried) If four of us can get through, let
us pick our own sleeping arrangement (Staff: If 5 people gets through!) But, but! What! (?) If we win 'Cham-Cham-Cham', then you should all sleep here! (Unexpected blow) (Why us...?)
The entire staff should sleep here and sleep with your cameras! If we win, we will sleep in the rooms and the staff will sleep here (It's fromis_9 vs Staff) If we lose, we take the living
room and the staff takes the rooms Why do they have to sleep
with the camera? Wait! We need time, too! (Game plan discussion) (Confidence level 1000%)
Let's go. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Okay. I'll start! - Ready!
- Wait! (Moveable in all directions)
(Checking the rules before starting) Cham-Cham-Cham! (fromis_9 Vs. Staff)
(1:0) (Second challenger: Saerom) Oh, I'm scared (Cham-Cham-Cham!) (fromis_9 wins again!) You have to sleep with your cameras! (Third challenger: Jisun) (Cham-Cham-Cham!(Intense)) (Staff wins)
It's okay. It's okay (Fourth challenger: Nagyung★) (Game over in a flash LOL) (Hayoung, the Solomon enters)
 Hayoung, you got it. Right? (Cham-Cham-Cham!) (Fifth round: fromis_9 wins!) Focus!
(Sixth challenger: Seoyeon) Focus
(Peaceful) (Free from all thoughts) (Cham-Cham-Cham!) (Victory) (...this is not what we wanted...) (If fromis_9 wins one more round, they win)
(No...) (Cham-Cham-Cham!) I did it up
(Lies) So did I! (In the spirit of sportsmanship,
we must be fair... you lost ^^) You are so cold!
You are merciless! Jiheon! You have to win. You've got to!
(Pressure is on) (Cham-Cham-Cham!) (fromis_9 won!)
(No....) (Party time★) Fold the camera tripod and
use it as a body pillow (Talking about an episode in the car) As soon as Saerom got in the car,
she was like, 'Where's my phone?' It felt really empty without it I was going to ask someone
to call my phone, but I realized none of you had it We don't usually listen
to music in the car, but I turned on music because
they didn't have their phones But Jiheon... she asked me
to turn it off, so I did! - They are merciless!
- Merciless! In our car, some people
played while others slept What's odd is that we were able
to sleep through all the noises (The winner's luxury) I woke up and
saw a field, so I snapped a few Our vision got better because
we weren't on our phones Right! 'End' was a good choice!
(Queen of positivity) (fromis_9 goes upstairs to pick rooms) I already picked a room! I like this one! (Saerom& Nagyung quickly picked one)
Isn't this room really nice? Nice! (Hayoung & Jiwon were second to pick) (Lying down) (Jisun likes the room)
Oh... I really... I really wanted grey
wallpapers for my house ... is that you? It's me! I came to play with my dog!
(Excited) My nails are caught in it! (Puppy got injured as
soon as she came to visit) Oh, it is detached It hurts a lot Come on
(Taking care of her injured pup) - Are you going to share this room? - Yes
(Gyuri hasn't decided) - Come on, guys!
- What? Oh, so the three of you... (I can play because I have a room★) (Seoyeon finally takes the hammock) -  Seoyeon! Come here!
- Huh? I'm over here! Everyone picked a room!
You're sleeping there? No (No way) (Deciding who will sleep alone)
Rock, paper, scissors! (The legendary scissors) Nice! I get to sleep alone
(Happy) (Loser) Too bad for me! (Accepts facts)
We slept together enough times! Both of us hate it! (Chaeyoung taking a stroll) My dog loves nature...
(Dog: Chaeyoung; Owner: Jisun) I'm scared! (Dog: Chaeyoung (21 months))
(She has a curious mind, but is also a coward) She often comes back
with mud all over her (Jisun, help me!) (Came out to help) I'm scared! I'm scared! (Next week!!) I had no idea about it! Don't try to stop me! I love you♥ (fromis_9 becomes funnier) (Are you curious?) (Are you excited?) (Then make sure you tune
in on time to catch us!) (I hope you look forward to episode 2) Channel_9
