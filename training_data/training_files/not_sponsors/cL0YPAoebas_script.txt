so do you remember how i built this shaver well i also just built this let's just say that things got a little out of hand [Music] or whatever better name inevitably gets commented the autoshear was designed to quickly and effortlessly remove massive amounts of hair taking you from middle-earth to truckstop bathroom in no time now in order to properly test a device like this i needed the help of an expert which is why i called johnny depp and when he couldn't come i called a hairdresser meet faith under normal circumstances hair removal is an art the careful eye of the hairdresser flits across her landscape like a sculptor at the block finessing away even the tiniest imperfection until all that is left bellissimo yeah that's not what we're doing here am i supposed to make this guy look good with that oh yeah now initially faith was a bit timid about wielding such a powerful device so i did my best to give her the proper motivation there's a line out the door of men who are starting to suffocate on their own hair if some skin has to be lost in the process not a big deal oh yeah i forgot to mention that i mounted the head on a stick on my cnc machine so that it would move around kind of simulating a fidgety client hold still little billy the process was having a profound effect on faith who now seemed to really really enjoy it very satisfying as we inspected our first client for damage it didn't really seem like he particularly enjoyed it this is kind of like a two-face from batman now in order to make sure that everyone has access to emergency haircutting devices i wanted to try repurposing some more common things like a weed whacker the funny thing about this mullet is you can't even tell i mean i suppose we could count the net as like some flesh that's come off the weed whacker would always get jammed or break the fine wire that i was using so we we just went back to cutting everything off with the auto shear mullet yeah i think that in dystopian future this is this is a haircut i still wanted to prove that a simple repurposed device could do the job so we drew some stubble onto this head to test out a vacuum covered with razor blades [Music] turning off power so some of the shattered blades had cut the vacuum's belt but what about our styrofoam head oh my gosh like it's like on the back it was clear to both of us that the auto shear was the superior emergency hair removal device but what would everyone else think of it yeah it's like edward scissorhands i think we're gonna show some hairdressers and see what they think then you push the thumb thing if you wanna [Music] oh my god you would think that we had now run it through every possible test but you'd be wrong so i think i've got one more test subject for trying out the power shears on [Music] what wait wait dot com slash joel creates and now back to elmo [Music] your turn since this was my first time really using the auto shear i found myself almost intoxicated by its surprising efficacy and i just kept shaving more and more and more and more and i actually feel really bad right now we can we can fix this it's okay buddy it's okay bud i'm sorry bro even when life leaves us battered and beaten it's important that we still find ways to laugh now i have some really crazy stuff coming up so if you're not subscribed to the channel you really should be but i'd love to hear what you would like to see in the comments below i'll see you next time oh hi mark
