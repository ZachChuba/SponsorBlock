a new crop Drupal overlap Ltd hotspot has just been published together with a very strong triple overlap today we're gonna take a look at the spot and see if it's worth it today's video is sponsored by secret that we all strive for the best possible gaming experience but the importance of a good quality chair is often underestimated secret ladder produces some of the most comfortable and high quality gaming chairs you can get so upgrade your commanders here today and fly in a style and comfort follow the link in the video description to their store type in your height the weight and it will tell you which chairs fit you for the best possible to seating experience hello ladies and gentlemen and who welcome back to leaf dangerous without with astronomy so as I said quadruple overlap hotspot has just been published this hot spot was first discovered about two weeks ago by a commander the English jet from the new pilots initiative these guys have been out here mining it for about two weeks and yesterday it was published for the rest of the community it's located out here in the swallows pique - our space 20 B - Iiro system and if we take a look you can see it is a bit of the way outside the bubble distress of reference you can see here you have the called two eight five sector hotspot the tribal hotspot there so you can see it is quite a bit further about twelve hundred light-years outside the bubble most systems in the bubble are within three jumps of this system so it is quite a bit further out then the other hotspot so the question is is it worth the extra travel time now running here in the background I have a video of me doing a trial run of this I've done the exact same trial run and I've done in the other one so even though I've made some slight alterations add some mining license to this build I will not be using the license in this test because that was the way I've tested the other hot spots so to make it an apples-to-apples comparisons I'm just going to use the exact same adding method as did before and as always I'm gonna take and set off half an hour for the mining run and see how much I collect but while this is running in the background let's just take a quick look of the actual overlap itself here we could see the picture that the new pilot initiative has kindly provided to me where they have drawn in the red circles was is the 100% edge of the hotspot the 80% edge shown by the green ring and the black ring is the 70% as we know from the last update for I made it a lot more efficient to be close to a hot spot that's why I think that daunt built the 70 and the 80 percent markers you can see here in the middle in white they have marked the LTTE 4 spot but you can also see that it is really on the edge of at least two of them almost three of the hot spots so it is a very weak L City for however marked in black you will see a very very strong LCD three spot that is the spot up in mining I've not been mining the LTTE for report from other people who have been out here and from the guys themselves is the LCD fall is not really that amazing but the LCD 3 is such a strong overlap that it's measurably better then the LCD 3 over in the cult 2 8 5 sector now I have to say a huge thank you to those guys because they've really done their homework and really really nicely they've actually provided me with this very very handy little graph here showing a comparison between the Ltd 3 and the Ltd force bar the other day 3 here in orange at the LZ 4 in blue on the x-axis if we have the number of refined taunts per asteroid and on the y-axis we have reversed the average percentage so keep in mind here that this axis is upside down so why they flipped it like that I don't know a little odd but we just have to flip that in our minds and what we can see here that the LCD 3 spot is all the orange ones is located further down in the lower right hand corner whereas it seems in general that the LZ 4 spot is more spread out but that's definitely more of them up in the upper left hand corner and remember the upper left-hand corner is low percentage and low tonnage out of the asteroid and the lower right-hand corner is high percentage high tonnage you can also see here that they added a trend line between the two data sets and while yes they are very similar and actually so close that I would probably say not really noticeable that would be within what I would call margin of error however what a trend line here doesn't show is which end of the graph the points fallen I could have the same trend line but have all the points located than right hand corner but I could also have the exact same trend line with all the points located into the upper right hand corner so while those two data sets would technically have the same trend line one would obviously be better since that would be in a high yield high percentage area and the other would be low yield low percentage area so overall just eyeballing this graph it definitely looks like that it is better to be mining into in the strong triple then in the low quadruple spot now before we look at the results of my little sister on here I want to talk about whether you should actually go out here or not because if you do not have a free carrier it's a long way to travel and I think you're actually better off if you don't have a fleet carrier so either go and stay in the cold sweet 5 sector alternative stay inside the bubble and mine a double spot or maybe a triple pane ID or something like that however if you do have a fleet carrier I do actually think it is worth coming out here for that strong triple hot spot and that leads me on to my own results I should say again this is very preliminary results I've done one test and one test only so as we see before there is quite a bit of RNG in this this could have been a very lucky run it could also have been a very unlucky run I don't know I've only done one test but here you have the results of my little half hour run in exactly 30 minutes I managed to collect just over a hundred and 70 tons of low-temperature diamonds which is very very healthy of course adding up to about 350 tons per hour I have had similar runs out in the call to it 5 sector so while I could have been very lucky on this one as well the preliminary result does look pretty promising once again huge thank you to new pilot initiative for sharing this with me and the rest of the community thanks for watching guys I hope you enjoyed this video if you did give a like subscribe and also next time I will see you guys in space you
