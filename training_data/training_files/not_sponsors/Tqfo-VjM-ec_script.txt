today's video is brought to you by ex period hey guy welcome back to youtube.com a website I made on accident while trying to buy a pair of shoes from Amazon in today's video I hope to finally prove once and for all that I do know how to resew you might remember a couple months ago I made a video about the hook tap mostly just because I was really tired of seeing their ads all the time specifically this one there's a rumor going around that Trevor Holt has the biggest yeah no I was very happy that this video went on to become one of my most viewed I actually got really worried while making it I always get in my head when I'm editing my videos but with this one specifically I came up with this conspiracy theory that hooked wasn't actually showing this ad to everyone like I assumed they did they were only showing this ad to me and so then when I went to make a video about how annoying the ad was everyone was just gonna be like I don't know what you're talking about I've never seen this ad thankfully that's not true most of you were like yes I'm tired of this ad as well and glad you made a video about this so lucked out there anyway I'm here for part two of this video because Trevor and the virgin are back kind of past couple weeks some people have been reaching out to me saying hey there's a sequel to The Trevor and the Virgin story the long awaited sequel the very much needed sequel even though the first one was like an 11 minute long movie that totally buttoned itself up at the ends not like there was like a cliffhanger something that had to be resolved maybe this is actually where the conspiracy theory comes true maybe they did only make the sequel so I would see it and make another video about it well joke's on you hooked app that's exactly what I'm doing now I had to reinstall the hooked app for this I did delete it after the last one not before getting charged again cuz I forgot to cancel whatever you downloaded the app and I was a little disappointed to find out that it's not another video it's just a regular story that you gotta read but then I realized wait no that's even better because the only thing more fun than watching these cringy awful stories is getting to voice act them myself now some of the first story real quick in case you forgot from the first video or if you just never saw the first video basically Trevor in the version part one was a story about Martha and this guy Trevor she didn't like Trevor at first she liked this other guy drew long horn yeah but then she and Trevor go to a party together they find out drew is actually kind of a jerk and then they kiss very much so that's where we left off the version is no longer a virgin thanks to Trevor and they're madly in love happily ever after right apparently not because part two starts with Martha pretty mad at Trevor and I'm excited to find out why I've only read like the first 20 percent of the story so let's keep got rumor has it that every girl on campus once drew long horn every girl except me now I could have sworn that I owned a cowboy hat I don't know why I was so sure that I did cuz I don't but this Fedora will have to do Martha what's up girl you're looking good today I give him a once-over he looks the same as he always does which you could pretty much say about every person I drew pulls out the chair across from me and sits down at my table then he flashes his infamous smile so uh what are you doing here I look down at my sandwich then blink up at him eating lunch he doesn't catch my sarcasm did I seriously have a crush on this guy who will cool so why'd you leave the party early last weekend things were just getting good between them I resist the urge to roll my eyes clearly he doesn't remember putting his tongue down Tiller's throat I had to UM study speaking of I better get to class I go to stand up but he puts a hand on my arm to stop me what was there what's the rush I wanted to ask you something you got any plans tomorrow I narrow my eyes with suspicion why the wet party yeah it really says the wet party that's what the party is called the wet party I want you to go that gets my attention the wet party is the most exclusive pool party on campus only the most popular students get invited and it sounds like I just got in really I clear my throat to hide my surprise I have to play it cool uh maybe what time starts at noon Delta house he reaches in his pocket and pulls out a ticket his smile widens in challenge as he holds it out you and the part of me wants to decline a wild party like this isn't exactly my scene but then I think about everything that happened last weekend and I know I'm up for his challenge and I bring a friend depends is your friend a girl yes he grins wider still then pulls out a second ticket then the more the merrier but there's one rule what's that hot bathing suits only none of that conservative crap did he just I my outfit I not hiding my reaction I leaned forward to grab the tickets but then I stopped myself cuz there's one thing I need to know first um do you know if Trevor's going Drewes quiet for a moment his gaze is uncharacteristically shrewd as it scans my face I heard he has other plans I reach out and eagerly grab the tickets then I'm hid later that day I pull a velvet thong bikini from the rack and hold it up to assess myself in the store mere whoa this is certainly sexy enough but can a girl like me really pull it off my best friend's whispered hiss interrupts my thoughts whispered hiss I guess her best friend is a snake you can't seriously expect me to go to this party I turned to face her why not I think it'll be fun she gives me an incredulous look it makes her glasses wait hold on it makes her glasses slip down her nose Vaughn since when do you consider skivvy pool parties fun seriously those things are straight-up meat markets I think I'm gonna ditch the snake thing with this character usually on weekends I can barely tear you away from your science books oh my god I just feel like doing something different okay she crosses her arms she can tell I'm hiding something and knows me too wait if I'm her best friend and I know her too well why wasn't I in the first one they even mentioned me in the first one and that was like a week ago so now I'm the best friend we met like three days ago and I know her well and I'm her best friend yeah okay what's this really about Martha oh wait what the [ __ ] no no I forgot I'm not gonna pay you money hooked you got ten dollars for me already and that was ten dollars too much if you ask me even though a lot of people watch the video I made about you and I definitely made that money back but still it was too much okay it's the principle of it fine if I have to wait 13 minutes then I'll wait 13 minutes hi Taco Bell yeah I'd like to order a pizza yeah you can put me on hold [Music] three nothing to see here just folding my clothes not plugging anything for a while oh wait the time anyway what's this really about Martha you've been acting weird all week does this have anything to do with Trevor Holt no I gave her a southern accent but I'm gonna roll with it I blow out a long breath it absolutely got but I haven't wanted to say anything out loud deciding I need to tell her the whole truth I gather my courage and finally meet her gaze no I told you about our kiss last night yeah you know afterward Trevor turned me down what do you mean I asked him did you know I feel my face heat I can't say the words but Deb apparently doesn't have the same problem oh my god you asked him to take your virginity you I didn't say it like that I asked him if he wanted to sleep with me and then he turned me down to have rears back in shock this time her glasses fall off her face what after the kiss we went into my room we talked for hours and then I rub a hand over my face trying not to let my humiliation take hold and then that was it I put sex on the table and he bolted Trevor Holt bolted Trevor Holt ba dev looks floored and I don't blame what Trevor never runs away from sex he runs toward it he's the guy with the would not stay involved I know his reputation you don't have to remind me I put my head into my hands he'd been so nice to me that night dad we connected we had chemistry oh god I really put myself out there when I told him that I wanted him I squeezed my eyes shot with embarrassment and now whatever I'm over it it was probably for the best I don't even know what I was thinking he doesn't sleep with girls like me yeah girls like me because you know I read science books on Saturday night Deb's face falls then she pulls me into a hug it's his loss Martha forget him seriously let's go to this party really really we're gonna have a blast at the party of the year you don't need some stupid football player to do that then she posted a bikini I've been eyeing from the rack go with this one it's totally your coat I knew the wet party was gonna be wild but as we step through the doors and into the backyard of the frat house I realize it's not just wild its untamed shirtless guys are guzzling beer girls and bright bikinis of every color sprinkled the law is pure unadulterated chaos everywhere I look a grin spreads across my face this is exactly what I knew Dorothy we're not in Kansas anymore I guess she's British now I don't know I laugh haha no we are now let's but my words get stuck when I look to the left is there he is the boy that isn't supposed to be here my breath leaves my body in a whoosh he looks just as good as I remember strong arms corded with muscle wide solid shoulders and bright piercing blue eyes my heart starts galloping and my chest I don't want to see Trevor I swear I don't want to see Trevor but I can't seem to look away wait that's the end of the episode oh my god how long is this that's only part 1 of 5 drew walks up to me effectively blocking my view of Trevor and putting an end to our heated stare - Martha you made it I forced myself not to peer around him but I bounced on my toes feeling fidgety ears are over there in the coolers but you look like you need something stronger he holds up a shot when I toss it back instantly death gives me I guess I shouldn't be where dad gives me a look I'm gonna grab us a cup of water be right back I nod what are you doing here Martha I stiffen and very slowly bring my gaze to Trevor's he's standing the sides drew hands on his hip god he looks hot but he humiliated me last week so you know what screw him I have every right to be here I can have just as much fun as the next girl in fact I deserve it hello to you too Trevor and for your information I was invited here is that a problem drew throws Trevor a smug grin not date none of your concern he puts an arm around my shoulder and I do my best not to cringe but I falter under the weight of Trevor's knowing stare I turned to drew are there any more shots your wish is my command he come and then he rides his horse to the vehicle a date with drew really part of me once Trevor to be jealous but his stare is boring into my soul and I can't help it I have to be honest it's not a date drew invited me and I said yes that's all there is to it Trevor crosses his arms over his well-defined chess I guess I'm just surprised I thought this sort of party wasn't really your thing my cheeks turn red but I try to appear nonchalant maybe now it is could have fooled me you look uncomfortable he continues glowering at me and I can't figure out what his problem is what happened to the laid-back fun-loving guy I [ __ ] I mean that last weekend is my presence bothering him that much my voice Rises with my time maybe I'm uncomfortable because you're glaring at me and I have no idea what I did wrong he blows out of breath then he looks around seeming annoy stop worrying Trevor I don't expect you to babysit me like last time I can take care of myself are you sure about that cuz this party gets pretty crazy and don't want me to what have fun live a little seriously what's your problem with me being here his nostrils flavor I'm worried about you cuz you don't go to parties like this you hear I'm what Trevor say it he's just about to respond but a familiar voice calls his name's we're setting a beer pong be my partner I wear a scarf to a pool party guys I was out of hats I'm sorry too really suddenly by my side again two shots in his hands beer pong sounds perfect I'm Way too sober right now and that needs to be remedied you down Martha I take a shot from Drew's hand and toss it back I can feel Trevor's Cod stare on me the whole time drew puts an arm around my shoulder again when we walk away I've got it I'm sorry guys I'm getting lost with all these characters we walk away Trevor follows he stares as drew and I set up one side of the table and he's forced to go to the other Atilla runs a hand down his arm then her eyes snag on me recognition fills her gaze and her red upper lip curls with disgust you again she points a long nail in my direction you better watch yourself Trevor pushes her arm dad be quiet Atilla drew just laughs god I can't come on we all just want to have a good time his arm slithers down my waist and I see Trevor's eyes lock on the movement when drew starts to bring his lips towards my neck Trevor claps his hands together loudly startling everyone Longhorn switch sides with me the glare is too strong over here I can't see the Suns in my eyes pila narrows her eyes where are your sunglasses must've misplaced them drill drill blinks once pinch rug sign with me I can see you better from down there anyway I force a tight smile but when Trevor walks over the smile fades I hate this new tension between us but I don't know how to fix it I suddenly feel til his eyes on me again drew might not have cared about the partner switch but I can tell she isn't happy her hands are crossed and under her ample chest you know not every detail is necessary she looks me up and down from head to toe smirking in my conservative sundress and then she smiles wickedly I say we make this more interesting let's raise this stage Drew's eyes drop to her cleavage what is your boob set I mean what did you have in mind drip beer but if I have to start taking things off you won't know which character is which I'm game how does it work every time drew or I sink a cup one of you has to remove an article of clothes and she licks her lips at Trevor and vice versa I shrug trying to look casual sounds easy now I strew until a finish setting up their cups Trevor puts a hand on my own I don't think this is such a good idea I swing angry eyes his way what is it playing strip beer pong or me coming to this party in the first place that's not what I mean it's not that I don't want you here or that I don't think you belong he pauses to rub a hand over it you're a sweet girl Martha and most of the people here are not I don't want you to get hurt I'm 21 years old Trevor just like you I'm not some delicate flower and if anyone has hurt me here it's you crack I didn't mean to blurt that last part I'll trevor his chest expands as he sucks in sharp breath how did that luckily drew interrupts before you can fend for ever let's face off he tosses a ping-pong ball to our side of the table Trevor catches a ball easily and sets up again through but when they both throw the ball it's Trevor's that goes into the cup drew just shrugs good-naturedly that's what I get for going up against the quarterback and he takes full advantage of the situation he pulls his shirt over his head in slow motion and yeah though his body is kind of a masterpiece I can barely suppress an eye roll all right our ball hope you guys are ready to get naked [Music] what am i doing okay I'm actually gonna skip a little bit of this cuz I would feel really uncomfortable reading it to you basically Martha's like the first person who has to you know strip off something then she gets all nervous cuz you know she doesn't want people to see her tits and butt but then she freaks out goes inside and dab is there and she's like no you can do this as she builds up the courage and goes back outside and says this Atilla you said top or bottom how about both and then she she gets fully naked which I get were the story's coming from it's like oh she built up the confidence but strictly from like the game point of view you just lost but anyway she gets naked and jumps in the pool and then everyone gets naked and jumps in the pool and then Trevor gets naked and jumps in the pool and then they kiss and then they put their clothes back on and they leave and then she goes back to her dorm and it ends exactly the same way that the first one did with them closing the door and implying that they had sex so I can only assume that they didn't have sex and there will be a part three and I will not make a video about it I'm done hooked I'm done with you all so I did just realize this was an audio story that did have voice acting but after listening to a few seconds of that I realized it was probably better that I did it myself he laughs loudly and spins me around flash' in conclusion the hooked app what do we think of it now two months ago I was very quick to say that the hook tap was not worth the money because there simply wasn't enough content on it and now that some time has passed and they've added more content the new question is is hooked now worth $5 a well I give this habit n out of 10 thumbs down normally this would be the sponsoring today's video and I will see all of you guys at the wet party [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
