previously on high-risk hardcore iron man boss used to be a hardcore as far as his name and identity goes oh i can't tell you something engineer i've added all of your accounts that i know of and put my private option to friends no no no no no no no no oh my gosh you can't go for that second piece of dagging high he will kill you i don't have much time left but oh god no no no imc engineer i have word that hardcore pp will begin wilderness slayer soon for the second dagon eyepiece it's time to end this i'm appointing you with more men they should help you in your hunt but lord zamora guy silence your past achievements should make you capable enough for this hardcore however it seems you have underestimated him if it wasn't for that fool gothics i would go there and take care of this myself but since that cannot be done you're my best option go now and show him the wrath of samurai stage 3 is nearly underway but there's one giant obstacle we need to get over first obtaining another piece of dagon high as far as i'm aware i'm the only hardcore game that has one tag in high piece so obtaining a second one is going to be quite the challenge especially with mr engineer on my tail the entire time but i'm hoping we get it done because if we do zara is unlocked once again we can go to god war's dungeon we can start doing our master clues and we can even start going for the dragon pickaxe to hopefully get to raids one let's get this episode going good luck mr engineer no way i can't believe it i uh i can't believe it i i've been so lucky here it is not even real i cannot believe it technically that's zenite number five we made two anguishes but it didn't matter we still were able to finish the zenite grind in less than 1000 kc i believe the kc was just about at 700 and it was seven kills under 700 demonics kc and we are officially done with demonic gorillas and here it is 1 000 basilisk kc and no jaw so yeah this just happened uh in about the span of 100 pickpockets i was able to obtain eight enhanced crystal teleport seeds two of them were back to back which is actually a one in one million chance because they're one in a thousand drop so extremely lucky here this is going to be a lot of crystal shards all right trade eight enhanced crystal teleport seeds for 1 200 crystal shards my goodness what's going on hello please now please no please don't know oh my gosh and here we go decided to make an anacar teleport inside of my plate around house so i can get there much quicker and it's very dark and ominous lovely a bit of context with this next clip here a pvp hardcore that c engineer has his eyes set on right now is this hardcore called zack as he is currently i believe the highest total level hardcore in pvp worlds he decided to meet up with me as he had some information to relay to me about c engineer as it seems he'd recently been found by him in places where he didn't think it would be a possibility of scrying i'm still not entirely sure how c engineer was able to find zach in these situations that he stated but he did list in his last video that the way he's scouting these hardcores is the scrying pool i don't know if there's another method i think that may be the only one which is why he was able to find me at that one cemetery in the last episode but of course i'm always going to be open to more information so i'm making sure c engineers and one step ahead of me because if he is i'm gonna be dead he said to me it will only be revealed when you or i die [Music] wow 44 minutes i think i pb'd by about 30 minutes there blowpipe is insane you're not lucky and there's 81 mining while we're getting the sand for our crafting levels and there is 91 crafting two more to go there's 93 hit points one more hit points level and we get an upgrade on our saradomin brews there's 91 range well it looks like we're doing sins of the father death isn't on my to-do list today hardcore iron man by the way so i'll have to decline and there he is and there is sins of the father completed yes another or not another casket the first elite cask in the wild and the first one that we are going to be able to store and wait until we finish this lovely master clue once we enter stage three all right there's another abbey task done for a total of thirty 2239 kills and still no second whip and there it is scrying pool has been made and there we have 93 crafting now we can plus five boost and get our amulet of torture i've got one more try after this yes string it there it is zenite amulet and after this magic potion boost the last zenite has been acquired the amulet of torture is obtained [Music] holy oh my i there it is there it is bassless jaw it's on the ground and i've just picked it up 1329 kc attach the jaw to the helmet and we have the helm of nate is not absolute unit it is time to get back into wilderness slayer as i go for the second piece of dagon high obviously i'm not going to be able to record every single key drop or hard clue scroll drop but i will be giving you highlights of every single slayer trip into the wilderness as well as incremental updates on how far along i am with the keys and the hard clues curls let's go oh this got no way there is no way how okay i'm back i'm kind of an idiot because obviously if i've got the player on if i've got the player on house teleport here it can be scrying pooled so that's probably how he ended up doing it now i'm not going to use this teleport again because i'm guessing he's camping this area and he'd have a solid one wilderness level to tele-block me so i'm going to do is i'm going to go to trollheim and then use this shortcut down here and walk north i have not hopped worlds by the way that would just tip him off since he already knows which world i'm going to be on yup there he is i knew it i knew he was gonna do that the man is diligent i will say also i forgot to bring you have you cannot be serious have you been there all day and there we go 20 tasks done that's 125 point boost for a lot of slayer points look this is what i mean look at that right away i'm so stupid who are you people 45 and another laryn's key let me get this kill c engineer oh i wonder how he found me there greater demons here we go this is a great task dangerous task in the rev caves but still a very good task [Applause] [Laughter] i thought he might come from that direction no no no no no please let me alone i got a larynx key if i just get a larynx kill skip this task i swear oh come on see oh my gosh how did i not see you holy crap that could have been the end he logged in in that alcove right there gosh damn it oh my holy crap oh my gosh that was it how was it that was it you sneaky sly little [ __ ] move bolder oh my i didn't notice that he changed his name very close that time very close and very quick no i gotta learn ski on that kill [ __ ] you no no no [ __ ] you [ __ ] you i don't care you can t be me i'm getting that laryn's key man [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes my laryn's key no way man like two kills before the task ended these are level 22s one in 1144 from a level 22 and we also get our 40 wilderness task boost of 125 points you i mean i love you but i also hate you at the same time because i think you want me dead quick check up on those laryn's keys we're at 27 right now [Music] i thought i didn't get it off at first nobody even got a teleblock on me there we go finish that now let's get out of here we got him and that's a total of 39 caskets now in the next couple tasks yes finally i got this task this is single-handedly the best task that you can do because you get better or you get a higher chance of slayer keys for the slayer monsters hey i'm okay with that and then back to back from the uh ecumenical key to another laryn's key this task is amazing no way no way oh my get off me get off me get off me get off me get off me let me get it tele grab it grab it yes elder chaos robes that's awesome and there we have it that is 50 tasks done with a point boost of 375. now i got 1755 what okay i know you think that that tp was really slow but the reason for that was because the man was in like a crossbow and black d-hide also it can be somewhat dangerous to do this when the rooney rocks are here because then i'm gonna get up yup there you go right there oh my gosh no way no i'm dead i just died oh my gosh oh my i can't believe i just oh thank goodness for that lash splash the rest of the team was coming in and i was i would have still been in multi oh my gosh he did it again and i wasn't even [ __ ] ready for that one oh i can't believe i got the teleport off i think i'm gonna start praying melee every single time i go inside of that cave shortly after this the engineer messaged me on twitter saying that the xp drop was 418 strength xp there's been a lot of people arguing on whether or not this would have one hit me but i am pretty confident if i did get hit by this i would have died and there's a casket i unfortunately had to go to andrana so i had to bank everything which is very annoying but i'll re-gear 53 caskets and there's another two laryn's keys we're now up to 48 51 keys oh the teleblock landed too and hello mr engineer i called it hey how who were they well this was certainly a surprise it seems that framed along with soup and goody are now all assisting sea engineer in this hunt to try and kill me i'll have to remember this and take it into account every time i enter wildy from this point forward you guys can i just note here that the person that got the tele-block off was a guy in black d-hide with a crossbow okay moving on i have come to the conclusion that the burning amulet teleport may no longer be able to be used oh you are joking right now he is caught in two tbs in full d-hide and a crossbow and i'm in this gear i am i am upset what is happening okay they know what task i'm on i can't do this task anymore i just wanted to know why they decided to make their tea beer a guy with black d hide at the crossbow is that soup is that super is that goody because he got the last tb too and framed and see engineer were sitting in near max and here the guy with the crossbow and black d hide gets the tv off i'm going to be opening the laryn's keys for the end of this episode the way i'm going to go about this i initially thought i was going to use the arty lever to go to the wilderness but it's probably safer to go gorok portal here then run to the chest let's go it's been quite a long time laryn's chest what do you got for me this time [Music] oh my gosh no way we got it oh my god we got it and it's the top it's the top yes yes yes get out of here we're in stage three that is it we're in stage three dagging high rope top i can't believe it i can't believe it oh my gosh [Music] [ __ ] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Music] you
