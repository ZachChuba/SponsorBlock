what would camp out for days for rain trainer for days if I was going camping I read a sentence I are the great thing about this game is can live stream multiplayer games in real time to YouTube took me longer to understand that sentence then it will for them to complete the whole game well it basically implies is that could watch other people playing a computer game online what you're doing I'm watching a Peruvian kid play a Russian kid shooting game I'm leaving the same dos David Beckham I sometimes think we may have been separated at Birth they only wears them once and you've only got one the thing that annoys me about him the most is that everyone says he's got OCD cuz doesn't waste pants twice that's not no CD that's just been a waste of hope Rick Victoria said about Mitch Jeff there's three comes in their cupboards he throws one away so there's two what a dick just buy another one and then there's no what really need to stop believing what think but what she said that and she does it it's a magnificent turn of phrase relieving numbers it won't I call this kids seven I must annoy him every time he looks into the eyes of his own child he must just think should I just say they like that anymore it's got a deeper voice now I sure it's eerie wake up I ever had I used to have a cab in bed and one day a cab in bed know a bed that's built over like a wardrobe on a desk so it's like a it's like a bunk bed but instead of a brother you've got storage which I rolled out of it while I was asleep and woke up in midair unbelievable know when you're about to hit the ground I was already laughing and asked the best thing know when wake up is I have a recurring nightmare about three or four times a week that I'm back at school and I'm outside chemistry and I haven't done my homework and my labels come off my calculator and I have that dream about three or four times a week and it's worth it for the feeling of waking up and going I'll never have to go to school ever again school again it's not amazing don't have to do geography chemistry maths never have to do PE Oh not obviously done PA for a living you're the best at B oh thank Maps mmm that's a great maths is great maths is gymnastics for the mind I love it and really took this times I think about in the week and I just think I just don't know what do I just I think sit in a tree and spit at pigeon what do think I do John that's one I think I just have no idea I just can't imagine eating food catching going for a run or watching TV I just imagine in a dark room to sort of softly lit just your face staring at yourself in a mirror worst thing about guests staying overnight the other thing is when stay at someone's house and they don't tell straight away what the weird things about their outs are just say cannot flush the toilet unless stand on that floorboard and sing Oklahoma otherwise you're in there at 3 o'clock in the morning still trying know they can hear they urge the first time when it didn't quite flush didn't come out they just left in there all and I pulling the thing and I right away a little bit longer but now it's empty again I got standing here for 20 more friggin minutes trying to flush this piss away when I had enough in our debate whether it's ruder to leave the piss in but not way come up with a flush and now called the flush asked if you're quite fastidious I imagine don't like people using your stuff I don't mind them when I give them stuff don't help yourself to stuff I'm gonna make yourself at home that's a cliche isn't it say it but don't mean it um and someone starts making themselves a cup of tea think that's not where the tea's kept right I'll make a cup of tea when I said make so far my men sit down and shut up [Laughter] most people think that life would make a good musical true or false what are gonna say John I don't think anyone would say that my cat sadly my cat said to me I think my life make a good musical I have to say it's been done mate sorry only 1% of people admit changing their voice depending on who they're talking to do do that change your hair James I acquire accents quite quickly and if I do gigs if I go to a town I instantly start thinking in the voice of where I am does that not sound what you're taking the piss though exactly I've been doing gigs in Newcastle new so I'll go to a club after go out Cheers me it and it's an all  the last year uh well it can't all be fun can it the Leveson cost millions of pounds and took a year and his conclusion was a keep an eye on them one of his comments was like a Yoda thing he said who should guard the Guardians not no one well I commissioned Yoda who should look after not no-one that's possibly someone named hmm what do prefer home cooking or fancy restaurants how many of the recipes that you've cooked on telly do think people have done at home i watch your shows but i don't bake muffins he cuts my recipe I've made of recipes I think the thing is about fancy restaurants anymore is it people don't really like fancy restaurants they want some like nice home cooking or just a steakhouse or something okay one John what's your how do cook home how do prepare me oh spend your afternoon with a little bottle of wine doing prep don't get it all in your little bowls and your jars so really he's putting the whole day cooking it absolutely and don't have people around either they'll ruin it do cookery shows in your home yeah sometimes a little bit now and that's the problem I have I don't mind the cookery show the cooking is fine it's that bit at the end what they make look easy is suddenly having loads of cool mates who turn up Jamie Oliver never finishes a flan without their door bar garden oh it's my mates who in a band we're just riding our mopeds down to the Grand Canyon where we're gonna have a picnic I can finish your meal let's go out there's nobody else here to see this no waste of four hours of my piss in life that was now Gemma's even worse she comes down in the middle of night guys hey they're all upstairs but I'm just eating flan at three o'clock in the morning but I'm still thin even though I eat cake at midnight but if do that you'll actually die ever have people snow ever sometimes yeah I mean well the worst thing is knowing that you're looking after them better than they look after give them clean bedding and I'll put a bed out on our and breakfast and then go around their house and they open up some cupboard and pull out this Dickey horrible sleeping bag that they've had for 15 years every rank mate they've ever had to come round yeah we just seal them up in this at night so their sweat and their feet really just pull it out for and go why don't we just share bath water and know either and then when I come out mind I do I'm a little juvenile put the bed out and a clean pillow and then sometimes I think I'll sod off bother coming round and then they leave and I think I actually I wish they'd started I've got a bad an eggnog why I've done this I've got some eggnog but I thought some bacon flavored vodka so making bacon and egg nog it's just egg and cream why would do all right well taking don't want one then I'll have one I've got some other drinks don't worry about that I'll pass I'll give two these over here I'll give the vodka monster and bears the vodka tastes that genuinely I mean that looks like a  this no no that's all need the other drinks that I've got for just because Christmas drinks are fun I've got this is Pizza flavored fear so it's it's beer but genuinely tastes of a pizza get involved drink smells of bacon cuz I don't know the washing up properly he drank both your body vinyl yeah have some more Madonna is - that tastes that taste of Peyser that tastes of people [Applause] I changed my mind it's not a discharge I'm gonna smell so good on the tube home okay so top thing Brits only do Christmas is something do a Christmas dinner [Applause]
