except we're not going to be adding any nail polish or inedible glitter or any bit like that to this [Music] oh my god I have to stay it's my day Ben which means you got to do the work hello everyone it's her christine again and me Ben hey how are you so it's Christine's birthday thirty Wow oh you look great for not using face Thanks all right this week we're gonna give Christine a little break and I'm going to bake her a cake for her birthday I found a recipe for a very special birthday cake how did you know it's a London Fog beer cake made with organic cream of Earl Grey tea but first I have just make sure you use the code all right back to you gotta wear this oh come on it's my party and you'll do it I want to since I'm turning 30 I will drink from this Cup only oh wow if there's hollow in it that one preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit can I help ya don't for now what all right smartass steep six perfect spoons of organic cream of Earl Grey tea you have to do it a 200 degrees Fahrenheit does that really matter yes are there like tea drinkers out there who are like it has to be exactly 197 degrees Fahrenheit it's very important you don't want to burn your tea okay all right so 200 degrees Fahrenheit for five minutes you got this I got it it smells like having a bath I spoke to the PR team and they're like tell her we really liked the the bath video how does that 109 degrees Fahrenheit they want me to have a bath right well not right that later later okay okay so we need a perfect spoon yeah I have a lot of them pick one we don't need seven they're so pretty though rose-gold what's so great if I do you like tea so much why do you like hockey so much so that's six spoons of tea Ben that's a lot you're making one very strong cup especially considering I'm gonna eat this whole cake [Music] Christine told me for her birthday she wants to not leave the house or see anyone or do any can David come over and [Music] she's done now we drink oh these are some big bags where's my tea though like to drink you're making me a tea cake and you don't even make me tea yes I make it very well all right so you've lined the bottom of your 9 inch cake pans with parchment paper now in a medium bowl you're gonna mix your flour baking soda and salt so we're actually doubling this recipe so we could get two tiers to this cake don't cry so I've got five and a half cups of flour and we're gonna add no tears then 5 teaspoons of baking soda and half a teaspoon so I wasn't a teaspoon there's a whole bowl yes now in a small pot you're gonna melt your butter where's the fourth stick how do we use it in a trim trim video or something no yeah we're good and with the butter we're gonna add our sugar and beer megi are you there for my birthday party alright our butter is just about melted so we're gonna take that off the heat stir in 2 cups of room-temperature beer into the butter tea flavored beer that's crazy like what in this world is trying to get me drunk [Music] you know I prefer my tea without beer in it the goal is to be able to actually eat this cake how many cakes have we made on this channel and have not been able to eat them just to just hey I made you a meal recently that was edible yeah it's great you don't need to measure life this is mine I always like my birthday week not because I get any gifts because I always say like I kind of want anything but because I can just continuously use it as an excuse to get you to do things like Ben can you cook dinner it's my birthday week every week is your birthday yeah but you complain you're like Katy Perry if you want a piece you can get a taste give you something good to celebrate what's that song I'll make it like your birthday everyday now we know your musical interests and so we're adding two cups of cane sugar that's a big cut Ben that looks frothy mm-hmm and then one cup of brown sugar as well whoa what's happening to it it's melting pretty much equal parts beer sugar and butter sounds like the American dream all right so we're gonna set that aside for now and then give me my birthday present it's the nail polish mixer I'm gonna bring this out of storage today are y'all ready for this did you have an easy-bake oven growing up so why aren't you better at making me because society tried it and they failed so we're gonna add four eggs egg on your head cook an egg on your head let the yolk fall down no crack an egg on your head crack an egg on your head let the yolk drip down let the yolk drip down let the yolk drip down do you feel the chills yeah we're gonna add one cup of cr√®me fraiche French cream bean belly swelled the savoir faire can say pepe dudes if we get flesh in a cast oh wow this is really old it's like Greek yogurt I'm sure the French would be very disappointed that you called it like Greek yogurt I think competition come crashing Greek yogurt what if they're the same thing from like the same supplier and they'll just go by different names or tablespoons of our extra steep tea it looks like vanilla extract I think he totally could have makes this yourself you're just lazy you know it's automation replacing human labor you know yang 2020 math what that's not where I was going with all right so there's your base your base coat there's the base of the wet ingredients and to that you're going to add the beer mixture and mix until tomorrow is going me are you talk you say something is anyone taking Ben's cake tutorial seriously where'd you get this recipe anyways off the David's tea blog really and we're gonna slowly add the beer mixture in there that looks red like a latte I'll drink this in the morning all right now we're gonna just add our dry ingredients into the wet you're doing remember when you turn this on on me and it like spraying everywhere I don't do that to you it's too late no oh my god it's really good oh yeah nice and thick nice and thick and glossy go for that I think you should put like a glossy taco on top no putting nail polish on this cake but we've been over this already all right that's it now we just got to throw these guys in the oven for about an hour when's your tee time okay let's go could you get the oven all right cue the cat clock we'll be back in an hour [Music] all right think looks like a giant muffin yeah they really puffed up here okay we're gonna use the toothpick trick so scratch off the nail art no see if you poke it in and it comes out without a bunch of cake batter on then it's probably cooked these are probably gonna take a good hour to dry my glossy taco is faster than that yes baking a cake does take longer than painting your nails now you know but in the meantime we could make our Earl Grey icing yep all right so the ice thing is pretty straightforward just one cup of butter three cups of icing sugar I'll stay in charge of this time nope open the top it's not like a bag of milk careful careful oh I'm a smoke so what if you just like ate a whole cup of that cinnamon challenge can you even swallow it or does it have that cinnamon effect where like you choke no you try comes the airplane whew and I need to do a whole cup [Music] that's it for the icing sugar so now it's just adding the tea so the recipe says two tablespoons there's one maybe a little extra extra team can I try just this it's out strong so this is six giant heaping teaspoons of steeped tea and only one cup of water [Music] it was all a dream I think we could probably take these over smells good try it yeah no you could use a spoon nobody should we have added that much tea the tea is great the icing sugar is really sugary I can infuse all my food with tea no tea burger tea grilled cheese sandwich tea turkey I have to make overnight oats the steep to Taemin why do their notes in this recipe I thought this was about me waiting for you to just try to force oats into it okay now what now we wait cue the cat clock again alright it's been about an hour the cakes feel probably cool enough that we can ice them first we have to level the cakes that need a knife so basically you just want to saw off the top are you ready where do you want it in my mouth okay a new muffin option literally tastes like the London Fog muffins never hand me the name so once you get it in at a corner it's actually easier to just spin it [Applause] just stab and twist right bend and snap we go and play frisbee ready so what do you think should be ice what do you think should we ice the middle right should we make it a rainbow though should we diet no we're just gonna rainbow cake yes cuz this is just nice Wow can I do the top I don't care what you say no it's just making a cake alright we don't have any candles but if we did I don't know any candles you can't fit that many candles on a cake okay that's the joke we say to my grandma gotta fill in all the gaps it's like a rich filler for your cake it's a smoothing base coat okay stop eating my muffin top its cake smells like a candle shop but you can eat it it is recommended that you go for a rustic semi glazed kind of look very rustic very authentic authentic all youtubers so I know last year we had a giant party for you but this year was a little more low-key is that okay with you yeah last year was wild would you want to make a wish what are you gonna wish for candles for like a Ferrari or something I wouldn't want to drive that in public what are you saying you have everything you want [Music] that's pretty cool good - thumbs up because it's too good and now I must eat the entire thing it's like got this more heavy vanilla undertones it's really rich and warm it almost feels like a winter fall like yeah there's a warmth to it for sure just the tea the tea the finishing touch see you can eat the tea honestly this is so professional see what happens when you don't put glitter or nail polish in a cake thank you dear that's a cake thank you guys for coming to my birthday party glad you could make it there will be loop eggs down below in the comment section I would give all of you a little piece of cake if I could [Music] if this cake is beautiful then thank you and it wouldn't have been this cake without the tea so don't forget to use my coach simply when you are gay my Nuka Lee at the teeth or mentee do you want to smell the cake don't let her lick it thanks so much for watching and we'll T y'all [Music]
