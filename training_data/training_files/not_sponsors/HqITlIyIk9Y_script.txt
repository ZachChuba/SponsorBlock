hello youtube welcome back to the wii skill now channel today we are still talking trailblazer we're still excited for trailblazer we're having a great time today i wanted to talk about something really important on your journey we've been saying things about regions like what do you get from okay thanks for subscribing man we've been talking about regions and the way that we have been talking about regions is this we talk about regions and say oh you get this from this region you get this but maybe i want to rephrase the conversation today and say what do you have to do if you unlock these regions that's just a different way to frame this uh this conversation to say man i want this item from this region but if i'm forced to do this to get the maximum amount of points for each region then maybe i need to reconsider my choice and uh and take a different one but are you subscribed yet thanks for checking now the reason that we're gonna frame the conversation in this way today is because you think about it in terms of design everyone starts with two regions everyone is allowed to unlock three regions so jagex has an incentive to make sure every region has a similar amount of points so it's not like well i chose the fremnik province and there's hardly any points available there and so you're just screwed no they're making it so that every region has a very similar amounts of points what they can't do is suddenly change all the content around which means we can kind of tell the difficulty of an area based on the content that's in it so today if we look at what we assume all of the master slash elite tasks are in each area we might be able to better decide what we should avoid or what we should pick in order to efficiently get points in trailblazer alright i think an excellent way to go about this video is to look at an image and talk about the high level content that is in each area because master tasks generally require high skill levels high combat ability or just like a ton a ton of repetitions of like certain pieces of content so let's start off with one that i think is actually going to be really interesting boom i'm talking about the desert now in previous videos the comments have revealed to me that i've been bashing the desert a little bit too hard this video i think is going to be very very kind to the desert region because i don't think there's actually that much difficult stuff in the desert and if regions are balanced based on how many points they have it might be sick to choose the desert in terms of getting some easy points all right what are some things that we could assume are master level tasks certainly killing the cow fight queen is not going to be a master level task but maybe killing it something like a 500 times or 1 000 times would be a master level task maybe they would go as low as 100 but then again that might be an elite one nevertheless even if the master is one thousand kill count rest assured you'll also get tons of points for hitting certain thresholds it'll probably give you points once you kill it a hundred times and 250 times and 500 times and then maybe finally that master test is going to be a thousand something like that now what else is the content in here we have um ancient spells i don't really know how they would wrap a master task around ancient spells specifically sofinam's got the pyramid plunder mini game when you think about master task you think about really really hard stuff things that no one should like really specifically grind for because they're so rng-based or i don't know they they kind of suck to do getting level 91 thieving and doing the last room of pyramid plunder is not hard doing 500 games of pyramid blender is well pretty hard actually because every game lasts like five minutes but i think that if we were to wrap a master task to it it would be getting the pharaoh scepter there's a chance of getting the pharaoh scepter every single time you loot the golden chest at the center of each room there's a chance of getting the pharah scepter there really low chance but in the regular game there's a decent chance that you get at least one on the way to level 99 thieving in trailblazer way less of a chance because you're gonna be playing pyramid plunder with at least what times 12 experience rates times 8 experience rates or something like that so very very low chance that you'll get a ferroceptor but i assume if you choose the desert you might spend some extra time in there just going for it i'm thinking about the agility pyramid at this point and i don't know maybe a hundred laps would be something like a medium task but i doubt that any master level tasks could come from the agility pyramid so with the passive tier five relic unlock i forgot about this times three drop rate on certain unique items pheroceptor is probably one of them so uh if you choose desert get ready to grind for a ferroceptor it won't be that bad it won't be as bad now i've hinted at not enjoying this content in the past but hey maybe it'll be fun in trailblazer i don't know everything will be decently fun in trailblazer because of all the extra experience that you're getting the entire time but think about the mage training arena i bet that there is going to be a an elite or master test wrapped to unlocking certain items in the maid training arena maybe even unlocking every single item in the mage training arena that might be considered a master task but to do that you're going to be spending a lot a lot of time image training arena and remember points aren't necessarily going to be times five rate in fact they're probably not so that's going to take quite a number of hours to do but they'll they'll probably have you sitting in the maid train arena for a long time or maybe these master tasks are wrapped to something more tangible more concrete such as using the master wand from the mage training arena and bursting some smoke devils right or some dust devils maybe that would be a master task another one from h train arena maybe maybe casting bones to peaches will be some kind of task maybe a hard one even since they'll auto unlock it for your lumbee diary it's still quite a grind to get and costs quite a few points so they'll probably get you some points for unlocking that going back to the cow fight queen uh possibly getting getting a dragon chain from the caliphate queen as a drop might be a a task like uh maybe not master uh we've almost forgot to talk about the sorceress garden which i think might be represented by this house right here maybe oh this house right here the sorceress garden piece of content that not very many people use but isn't i wouldn't even consider it dead or anything it's it's pretty good training experience but it's a way to train thieving and farming to an extent but training in sorcerer's garden there's probably going to be some tasks connected to that maybe doing like 100 runs or something like that i doubt there'll be a master one there i don't know i think most people are pretty unfamiliar with with the desert and that's me included so i can't really think of any other like elite or master test but i'm sure there are a bunch next area let's talk about potential master tasks in the wilderness hard stuff to do i mean i'm looking at all of these bosses and what calls out to me are certain unique drops from each one maybe a certain kill count for each one but what other content is in the wilderness really oh one thing to remember in terms of of master tasks is pets are considered a master task but there's a pvm pet and there's a skilling pet two categories both are master tasks but if you get one pvm pet you're good that's all you can get you can get one pvm pet and one skilling pet so wilderness if you get any of those pets that's your pvm pet right there hey maybe you getting a dragon pick and using the special could have something to do with the task maybe not a master maybe an elite oh sorry new information for me coming in here pets are not master tasks in trailblazer still worth points but not master level i think that's good now something to consider about the wilderness is uh is jake ex going to somehow make killing other players a task and are they going to do something cool with it like kill unique players or kill certain number of players because i think that there's easily ways to abuse either one of those systems so it makes me wonder if that's going to be a task at all probably kill at least one is going to be a task we just had an awesome suggestion for a master task getting an eternal glory which is really rare apparently it's a 1 in 25k chance that charging a uh a dragon amulet at the fountain of roon very very small chance 1 in 25k chance to get an eternal glory yeah that would seem like a master task to me always consider though perhaps the passive relic of increasing rng is going to affect that so maybe it's not as bad but still a 1 in 8 000 ish chance is pretty bad pretty hard to grind for here's a really cool one get a rune bar using an infernal pickaxe on a rune rock in the wilderness that seems pretty hard and requires a lot of a lot of preparation to get that could be cool okay moving on it's taking forever let's talk about everyone's favorite golden boy our dune which is the official pronunciation by the way my official pronunciation uh what are the master tasks here getting some kraken drops maybe uh doing a certain amount of high gambles at barbarian assault that could be a good uh task good point ladder right there killing a certain number of demonic gorillas perhaps uh crafting your own xenite jewelry could be a big task then again uh they wouldn't make it a master level task only because like it's such an important thing to do that players are just gonna do it anyway getting a dragon chain or med helm from high rolling at barb assault very very low chance to get that one in 16k with with relics uh possibly one in 5k if it if it affects that i hope castle wars has a lot of points people play it hit me right in the nostalgia that would be so fun if they somehow incentivized castle wars but then again uh you'd only be playing with people who are like busy grinding their trail blazer points and they are um and you're limited to only the people that that pick ardy wait that's everyone oh yeah obviously master task would be completing 10 000 games of gnome ball without ever missing a goal we do have the sears course the rooftop course so you might have to run agility for a while for some some tasks let's talk about tyrannon there's all kinds of cool stuff in here we got zara with rare drops not that rare though like with the with the last relic it's like 1 in 40 drop to get the blowpipe and sir palm so that's decent we got volcano we got the gauntlet we got oh wait a minute we got the rabbit the highest hp boss in the game that's going to be a task isn't it i don't know what they could make us do and let you maybe like plant a dragon fruit seed in the letya tree patch but yeah get the blade of of salder run the agility cores get a certain drop from volcano oh do an entire corrupted gauntlet within a time limit that could be good let's talk about the freminik province we have things like the dagenhof kings we've got vorkath up here we have lunar island lunar isle actually is what it's called getting all three rings and imbuing them from the dagonath kings could be good complete holy books maybe all of them could be a task of some kind store 10 million gp in kingdom management interesting suggestion for a task all right let's go over to asgarnia uh it's got the giant mole highlighted it's got cerberus highlighted so cerberus has got some good drops equip the best in slot boots involving cerberus there would be good obviously scrolling up we'll see god wars but down here pest control getting void getting elite void obviously not a master task but a task of some kind oh master task get the max cape required to have asgarnia for those points great idea there get a full bando set get a full armadillo set equip those things man that would take a lot of work i don't think i'm personally equipped to do all that work that's crazy uh we didn't mention this in priff before but perhaps opening up a certain number of crystal chests over here in taverly would be a little bit of a point ladder getting a dragon defender could be a decent task wear full prospector gear good call on that one getting a champions cape now that would be a commitment that'd be that would be difficult okay let's talk about mauritania so obviously we have a couple of bosses over here everyone's talking about the theater of blood some people are talking about nightmare and the rare drops that are available from both and the difficulty in the feeder of blood yes doing a certain number of theater of bloods or it's probably going to be rng based getting a certain item definitely going to be a massive task in here but that said doing theater of blood is not a trivial matter it is a difficult thing to do barrows i don't think like certain like a master level would be in here even getting all six full sets of the armor i don't think would necessarily warrant master level points oh right darkmeyer heading into the sepulcher robbing the grand coffin like a hundred times that could be like elite or something like that right or perhaps instead of a number of grand hollowed chests it's literally just get the stamina ring and that's the that's the big task let's talk about the elite the master tasks on karamja we got zuck sitting here oh that's difficult task to kill zuck to do the inferno there might be something to killing jad a certain number of times we do have the brim haven agility course right behind zuck right there it could have something to do with tasks getting a certain amount of tickets uh um trading in a thousand agility tickets or something speaking of that by the way in the main game i'm sitting at like 250 brim haven tickets in the bank so i'm on pace to get 99 agility and i've got extra tickets killing jad in a certain amount of time could be cool turning in a certain number of fire capes could be cool getting a fury amulet that could be good getting obsidian pieces could be tasks crafting double nature runes hey that's a good good uh task to say getting the king a wagy monkey backpack as a potential task i don't know how many laps that is but if it's a thousand it's a good call i like that one of the last places that we need to look at is miss the lin this is true for karamja 2. you get these for free but we're still going to like think about hard tasks in each area so we have the abyssal sire here you've got the free-to-play boss giants in there you got the fossil island over here got the archaeologist there but what hard content is there lithgren here home of some rune dragons maybe get like the dragon crossbow limbs as a drop could be good complete the fossils in the museum excellent suggestion for uh for a task ancient wyverns on fossil island we got herbivore kill count on fossil island as well something with the volcanic mine maybe there's a hard task of never leaving the lumbridge chunk and then being able to chop the yew tree that wouldn't be that hard but i did just want to want to reference gridlock's iron man um other than that it's just like it's kind of hard to think of like other master level hard stuff to do in misslin it is the starting area for a reason all right everybody we spent some time looking at the map thinking about some of the harder tasks in there so perhaps you heard something that suddenly you're like well i don't really want to do that or there's an area that i can do all of the content here but i can't do all of the content over here i think it's i think it's a powerful thing to really be thinking about these things in terms of your preparation for trailblazer but remember i mean like this is really nothing to stress about and if you're here if you're watching this video you've probably thought about trailblazer enough right uh there's a bunch of people that haven't thought about trailblazer at all and they're gonna do fine too it's all good it's all good video everybody pleasure having you here please remember let me know those in the comments if you follow and i always smile i always smile that's it hello mix love love the message tree
