in today's video we're gonna figure out how to make an airplane fly using liquid color alright guys first of all great job on the flying ball that was epic crazy project for this week I was thinking of something that you actually were pretty obsessed with and you made like a preliminary design do you remember how when you watch Peter and he was doing the butane and the pops of Mentos and Diet Coke how cool would it be to see if we can kind of take where Peter left off when a lot of people need to be left off and see if we can power an RC airplane you know and shoot it into there usually they're you know Mentos power or something I don't care but I think at the end of the day we should have something flying through the air propelled by a fluid I like you what do you think I like the sound of it so I've actually heard of this thing it's a kind of like a water rocket and it's this PVC design and it's like an H frame with a stick and you put a 2-liter bottle filled with water and you put it on and you pressurize it then you pull up in and it goes flying up there and I think we can almost do something like that I love it I know things have a lot of power oh yeah yeah so while I do our first things first while we do a little research come up some ideas build some stuff put it under the test and then we'll see what we need to put wings on and shoot it off sounds good let's do it yeah alright we have a pretty big project ahead of us we have to figure out how to fly plane using some sort of liquid propellant typically our planes we use electric motors and propellers which push air to you know give us airspeed for this to get thrust we're using a liquid so that's gonna be a little bit tricky but I think the first thing we're gonna try is some coke and mentos classic and we'll try to see if we get with us out of that hmm we had to try to find out how much pressure we can actually get from these Rockets I don't know if it's going to be enough we haven't been able to get enough thrust out of these rockets to power an airplane no nozzle nozzle different sizes of nozzles we try pretty much everything that we could think of I don't know if it's going to be enough to power an airplane I couldn't be more proud of Andres said no I mean they are knocking us out of the park and there's also some very real challenges that they're coming up against but watching them try that Mentos and the coke there's one real problem that's not building pressure quick enough and it's just not going to be enough to make the plane shoot through the air but the really cool thing is this also got me a real nostalgic about a key point in my childhood where I had one of my favorite toys through the whole summer and that was a gym and yet - jab jaren jets just build the engine with water pumping full power and soar hundreds of beater bar the way a jamon jet worked was he basically fill a bottle with water you can press the air inside through a hand pump you'd put it inside the airplane and give you instant pressure in a few seconds of a very powerful stream to shoot the airplane about tree-level height and then let it glide down to the ground I think this could be a perfect solution for them to take on but also kind of give me a piece of my childhood back so I'm gonna throw another wrench into the works here I'm gonna go visit these guys and see how they're feeling but also pitch the side video all right before we get any further in this project I wanted to take this time to tell you guys about our sponsor for this video and this project and that is our friends over at hellofresh now if you guys aren't familiar with hellofresh hellofresh is America's number one meal kit basically you can have whole meals and pre measured ingredients delivered directly to your door so you can have an amazing cooking and dining experience cool thing about hellofresh that I love is it takes the guesswork out of it so it makes cooking at home fun easy and affordable so last night my wife and I we made a pinko chicken recipe and it was a ton of fun and actually this is the first time we cooked one together and it was a really fun experience to share together but beyond that beyond like getting really good food and making a really good food it's honestly like a little bit of a cooking school so you learn how to deal with ingredients that you typically otherwise wouldn't use and it tells you exactly what to do and how to do it and you have the pre-portioned ingredients so you don't need to worry about messing it up which is pretty awesome hello fresh offers so many recipes to choose from each week to help you break out of your recipe rough it takes all the guesswork out so you don't need to go buy bulk ingredients it comes with prepackaged individual ingredients so you have just the right amount of everything so you don't have to worry about wasting money at the grocery store it also actually saves you up to 28% on your groceries now this is because it's coming with the prepackaged ingredients so you're not wasting money buying extras of things nothing I really like about hellofresh is they are eco friendly company so the packaging hellofresh uses to ship your food is almost entirely made from recyclable and already recycled content and the cool thing it doesn't matter who you are how fresh is very flexible so it doesn't matter if you're like me and you have a family or maybe you live by yourself hello fresh has meal plans that fits the lifestyles of pretty much anybody so on top of all this awesome stuff that hella fresh has going on they're also giving back to the community so nineteen hellofresh donated over 2.5 million meals which is crazy and this year with all the crazy stuff going on with Kovan 19 they're stepping up their meal donations and as you can see the final product of what I was able to make in my little kitchen is pretty impressive so here's the best part about all this to find more information on hella fresh and they're awesome meals that they have gone on you go to hell of fresh com but beyond that you can use our promo code flight-test 60 it's right here it's also in the description and with that code you're actually going to get $60 off as well as free shipping so it's a great way I'm in you bind food anyways why not mix it up this month and try out our friends at hellofresh it's because of them that we're able to do what we do and making these projects and these videos for you and it's also because of you guys watching so thank you guys so much and let's get back to the project see how it's coming La Andres is digging out our air compressor I've been thinking about this whoom stick design it's a modified water rocket launcher and I kind of modify it to go more with what we're going to be doing which is launching a potential airplane off of this water rocket what I'm doing right now is I'm gluing together some PVC pipe and I'm making a boom stick so what you do is you fill a two-liter bottle about halfway up and then you put this boomstick in and it gets held in by a pin and then you pressurize it by a valve nipple on the back of the boomstick and then you flip it back over so the water actually creates the seal with the actual PVC pipe then you pressurize it when you pull the pin the Bhama goes flying like crazy it worked so no it just built his boomstick which i think is really cool and it's just an explosive amount of power right off the bat let's do one where to go so my job now is to make an airframe that can harness all that explosive power and really use it to its fullest capacity so that got me thinking what kind of already looks like a two liter coke bottle right they reminded me of the FT goblin which kind of has really stout sort of small wings and a roundish longest fuselage that kind of looked like a 2-liter bottle already the size of the goblin the compactness would really allow us to harness all that power strengthening the airframe and just take that explosive punch without breaking anything now for this plane we're just gonna use the Goblin wings the Goblin tails and then build a foam board cylinder that houses the two-liter bottle and that's pretty much the whole plane the Goblin and the boomstick combination is gonna give us a really explosive amount of power really high energy but it might not work we're not really sure so I'm thinking for a secondary option we should probably go for a little bit lower energy but longer duration which would require a smaller nozzle so for the secondary option I'm thinking we use a slightly smaller bottle so we don't have to carry all that weight of the water a smart water bottle it's about a liter volume and I think that would work great so I'm designing a 3d printed nozzle that screws onto the cap and we have a servo mechanism at the top that actually undoes the cap and allows us to release the pressure from the side at any time what that allows us to do is to throw the airplane from the ground build up some air speed before even letting go of that our using the servo to release all that pressure and give us even more air speed in there so for this smart water bottle option it has a bit less power but for a longer duration so I'm thinking that a more typical glider design might be the best choice for the airframe for that I think the FT Explorer would be a great choice it's already a a pretty big sizable glider but I think it's still within the size range that allows the smart water bottle to power it well for those of you who may not be familiar with the ft Explorer it's one of our DIY foam board speedboat kits that we actually sell it's about a five-foot wingspan plane that's really easy to fly we're gonna build it as a three Tanel trainer which actually it would be two channels since we don't have throttle really just rudder an elevator the wing has polyhedral which keeps us nice and stable in the air its self leveling which will make it easy to fly and when we hit that button to launch the rocket it's going to keep us tracking straight another thing that inspired this choice is that the FG Explorer is remarkably similar to the original Jama jet so similar design similar propulsion hopefully it works about the same so now we have two different thrust mechanisms we have two different airframes to test them on before putting more time into decorating and finalizing these planes we're just going to take them out test them and see if they work all right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] No so as you can see we're doing a bunch of testing with the smart water bottle on the Explorer and we're off to a bit of a rocky start it's not giving us the power of you really need and we're just struggling to get enough thrust to actually fly it so long story short we're having a bunch of issues with leakage we're just using a plastic bottle from the grocery store and some 3d printed parts and we're just having a bunch of leakage that is a result of those parts connecting and high pressure inside so we're just trying to do everything we can to minimize that leakage and keep all that pressure in before we actually launch so beyond that what we've learned from this testing is that the nozzle size had to be a little bit bigger than what we originally had so we're just taking a drill drilling that out makes the nozzle a little bit bigger and it seems to be giving us more thrust secondly the ratio between water and air in the bottle is really important even about half an inch worth of water is enough to see the difference in the flight we're finding that right around 1/3 of the bottle full of water is the right ratio and the rest is air and that gives us the right ratio of duration of the burst and the rest we get from it all right so this is crazy what we all thought was gonna be kind of a fun little quick project using up some pop and some Mentos turn it into a really crazy emotional rollercoaster where you all learn so much as really closely how Andrus and Noah really took found the challenge how they're willing to adapt and really really to overcome and along with that we learned a lot of valuable lessons about how you know nozzle size air pressure or fluid all works together to make a really cool thing happen so now we're about to go out and fly and put this to the test and see if their hard work paid off but with what Noah and us are gonna be doing in the future so we're gonna get our stuff in order and go out and see if she flies so we have our ft Goblin out here and the ft Explorer fitted with two different types systems I called this the boomstick pretty much the handheld water cannon fire off the water rocket it's nice and this is using a 2 liter bottle yep the FT Explorer is using a one liter bottle one layer Bobby one liter bottle and that's using a bit of a different system with a 3d printed nozzle and a servo release so with that one we can actually control when it goes off with this one you just yeah I'm excited because I think this one's pretty violent pretty crazy oh yeah alright let's go cool ok cool all this water in about a tenth of a second we we found out about a half an inch from the bottom of the label with 60 psi gives us a really good punch off the starting line and I would just slide the Goblin on we're ready to go it's really just a water bottle rocket I push it back you part that we're supposed to do that's good it's good why a nurse is flying yeah I think you should fly this one I won't try to they get the Jim and Jerry word cool ariana is Rihanna [Music] are you kidding me I was honestly anticipating like remember when you had the little kids rocket toys yeah let me go and then do this I really thought that that was what this was gonna be it would just kind of be this little bit that was power that was power it was explosive use a lot Panther way yeah accidently yeah good thing I brought that another pair of shorts nice yeah you want to go grab and try it on the launch yeah we had a pretty good launch that time went pretty far got a good glide out of the Goblin so we just need go get it fill it back up with some water and just get it ready to go again now I've had my fun I don't think so all right so so here's what's gonna do I destroyed that one you got to go first down on the explore cuz I'm not much faith in myself and then if there's still any pieces left I'll try it okay I hate to say I put a little bit more psi in there wow this just explodes just straight up there's a bottle spoon all I remember is you pull the pin and I just remember be like it is just fun this never done that before Wow what'd you put in it then you said you put more psi yep how much 75 so 15 pounds more I wanted to give you a little bit more boost good boy that's my boy the moral of the story this is why we build - right that's right all right yeah we have another airframe we need to slap this in there you go we're good to go we've got an explorer guys let's go and put that up in the air but you're first for sure okay so Andres you guys have taken me back to my childhood I mean the only thing missing here is a mullet is that a flashback all the way through college no that looks beautiful I can always see this thing fly but taken explore a water bottle in a 3d printed nozzle that's remote released and how close it bring back your childhood memories of the Jamie's answer is I can't wait to see if it performs with the geometry Oh right cool so no one's gonna be putting air in it um hopefully not more like you did last time right hopefully that doesn't happen again yeah this one basically the difference between the first one is obviously he's really sore the ground you right right so on this one I actually have a switch on my transmitter but right now it's the nozzle cap is shut it was when I flick it it actually opens and lets all that pressure out a really cool benefit of this is normally if you kind of flip it and you had your timing wrong you lose all your even water before you launched it right benefit with this system is a collection before momentum which means the bottle will give you more power not exactly exactly we're good to go good enough yeah he's knackered doc yeah all of that [Music] [Music] run nothing sore it is just going I might have to turn around before it gets into the creek always take that to the creek way longer than the jamming jet holy cow look at that I was gonna just make it work just make it just gonna make a run circles he was teasing me the other day hi guys great war room alright that Natalie was cool to the jam and yet but a flew longer enums RC he knows our scene yeah and we had control of it you turn it in the air I love it alright alright I'm gonna grab golf cart and go get Noah alright I'm the Goblin they were using a very wide diameter with a lot of pressure and they were getting maybe a tenth of a second but it's about 70 psi which launched it possibly even launched the wings off the airplane with this one the diameter is much smaller still has a lot of water and about a half a liter but they're only gonna be getting about four or five pounds of pressure but it's over a longer period of time so they're gonna be getting about maybe two seconds of power which doesn't sound like much but it can do a lot now if you got a lot of power and a lot of pressure on a plane like this the odds of it being able to fully harness that energy or not structurally failing to be very low so that's why a small diameter and a small amount of water over a longer period of time is definitely much better all right we're back we got the plane you ready we got to filled up [Music] oh dude bring out a little I got a little balance for this win now dude you were huh Wow I just if I get a little rich lips off already me no no bad move  I just killed most of my lips dude it still looks great Wow lookie look at that you just got a little bit there run Noah nice flight that is fantastic I do regret though I shouldn't have turned around I should have just went for distance gotta meet a brilliant Alex you guys absolutely rocked it here I mean from the beginning to the end here the way you created the Goblin and yeah discovery with the water and different things like the pop and the Mentos this here though just brought my childhood back I can't think you know I'm glad man yeah so guys I don't know where we go from this but I know we were filling this with a huge five gallon water bottle let us know in the comments below if you want to see us revisit this maybe up the ante or what kind of airframe you like to see or what kind of challenge like to see us take on and as always don't forget
