marShon old White's classic old White's said that he was you know speaking ridiculous or whatever if you listen to what he was saying it's one of the smartest things that an ex-player has said he's like listen I've been on the other side we got people that are losing their lives like what Marshall did was very noble up there now granted he did it strictly because he didn't want to talk to any of the humans that were bashing him to what he was saying which I respect even more but it is real like I think a lot of us and I'm even feeling this more and more trying to work deals for NFL PA and NFL alums like I'm I am active right now in trying to make sure we can get some money from companies for NFL alumni for other people to continue to make money because I'm not harm percent sure that the NFL PA does what they probably should do which is take care of you know the legends of the game the people that built the game and now I am somebody who is not saying let's go back in the day those guys did they did though and a lot of those guys haven't been taken care of so whenever Marshawn steps up and he says listen a lot of these players weren't taught how to manage millions of dollars a lot of people weren't taught like hey whenever you get a hundred thousand dollars all those things you've dreamed of owning in your entire life that you can now afford a lot of people weren't taught that discipline with their finances so whenever you hear this stat like 80% of NFL players or 80% of professional athletes will go broke just a couple years after they retire and everybody's like blah blah blah it's like have you ever just been handed a million dollars and said hey I know you used to sleep on the floor and I know you used to eat noodles and noodles and you used to do all these things for your entire life and everything you've ever wanted is now at your fingertips but you should be disciplined with your money and it's like yeah it's a lot easier said than done my friend and I think that type of thing that happens happens to a lot of players and I think Marshawn taking the initiative to talk about that is cool but I'm not a hundred percent sure Luke Kuechly is directly because of national think about something about that did Marshawn Lynch Hall of Famer in his own right talk Lukey did Marshawn Lynch from the town okay okay the town town business did he convince a Boston college grad that he needs to take care of his chicken and retire and if he did that's why football is the most beautiful game seeking now back to the magic people from two polar opposite parts of the world can come together for an agreement and understanding in for one common goal and that's the betterment of the future that's like Aaron Aaron Rodgers and Marshawn Lynch after the game be going taking their own special moment exchanging jerseys there on Cal they're both the Cal teammates together two very different vision that's why football is the greatest sport on earth by the way mat rules said this in his press conference Carolina Panthers it's real you walk into a locker room you got a short little dumpy guy oh he's the kicker okay you've got a six foot six guy who shredded who's 265 pounds oh that's a defensive end that guy is from there you got a guy from Compton you got a guy from bel-air you got people from all over the place coming together for one common goal that is why football is the most beautiful game on earth because of that and I think that is what people miss whenever they retire is that camaraderie with people that are very different than you being able to come together for one goal and being able to make it happen that'll probably be what Luke Kuechly misses the most if I had to guess for you is that what was that what you missed them off well we have a pretty good thing here right I think the ability to still be able to work amongst friends and to be able to BS and things like that I think that I I knew that that was what everybody talks about missing so whenever we started this and then went with barstool and then now alone I think that is something that has helped me out a lot and by the way I think that's what Hasselbeck loved this year whatever you got a chance to hang out with us like that's what every retired player talks about is like do I miss training camp absolutely not do I miss running my head into somebody absolutely not do I miss the paychecks yeah oh yeah I missed it but they also miss the camaraderie and I think I'm very fortunate that I have you guys use guys we're fortunate to have you been I agree glad you're retired
