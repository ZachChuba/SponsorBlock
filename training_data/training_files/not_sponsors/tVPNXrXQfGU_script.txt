hello friends this is yom thanks for being here today i'll be sharing the major differences between my previous nine-to-five full-time job in my current position as a digital nomad entrepreneur and this includes what i do differently now that i am my own boss in my own unique situation I feel that walking the path of entrepreneurship and being my own boss is important as an extreme man most and mainly because I value my time I value energy but I understand that entrepreneurship and my kind of lifestyle may not appeal to everyone so if you are walking a unique path of your own feel free to do what works for you and in no way do I believe that somehow freelancing is better than a full-time job so I'm simply here to share my thoughts and feelings in my own path the most life-changing aspect of minimalism is being able to create and consume with conscious awareness and it's important for me to apply the same approach to not only my possessions and living space but also to my career and to my work as well so it's important for me to let go of the unnecessary meetings to let go of the unproductive tasks and also let go of long exhausting commutes and most importantly to overcome work space competition jealousy and disconnection within the work space and within the industry and in my own experience and unfolding the three major differences between working full-time under company versus being my own boss includes more opportunity for healthy risk-taking so this means that I am able to constantly grow with creative challenges when I am self-employed now I'm also able to save more time and energy by automating my workflow and focusing more on the quality and value instead of filling a certain amount of hours within a week or striving for a immediate reward at the end of my job so the major shift that happened in my own life after quitting nine-to-five was more openness for new challenges and I became more welcoming of healthy risk-taking in the past I feel like I didn't really invest in career development so I didn't have much challenges I didn't face much risk and I did a half much room for growth and basically I was feeling stuck in the same tedious job but after choosing the path of self-employment I was able to absorb new skills and I was able to make conscious decisions that actually led to my growth and most importantly I was able to express my creativity to the fullest without feeling limited and I feel that this was all possible because I became less fearful of being responsible for my own business and I was less afraid of being the decision-maker in life and by overcoming my lack of enthusiasm and by overcoming the board in my head at my desk job I became more invested in personal development like mindful learning and self-awareness so now that I have removed my learning blocks I'm able to actively seek resources that can nourish me and things that I can't actually try and challenge me also be sure to share with us what's your next step in your own career and are you looking for promotion perhaps or are you looking to make a transfer or are you looking to quit your own job and do something new feel free to share your career or your finance goals with us in the comments below I also feel that another major difference between working under someone and being my own boss includes being able to freely automate my workflow and being able to make conscious decisions about my work hours so when a lot of my tedious tasks are automated then I get to take the rest of the day or even the rest of the week off without needing to open up my laptop I feel that this is a major difference because in the past I have to fill my work hours no matter what and I did this in order to prove my work and to earn that paycheck and I also felt like in the past my previous positions were not really maximizing - technology and resources available in order to be more intentional with time and energy but now that I am more in control the first thing I do is to first identify what can be easily automated and synced like my scheduling some of my social feeds and personal data like passwords and payment details and some of the tools that I like to use and recommend for automation includes a beer and I also like using HootSuite for social media manage management and I also use asana or Trello for creative content planning and the most effective living at - Ling comm / here you're living so with the combination of easy to use programs I get to focus on what really matters like the tasks that bring me joy and the things that actually contribute to my own creative project and I get to let go of all the tedious tasks that no longer serves me and that no longer serves my own business so less responsibilities and fewer things to worry about they all bring me more peace of mind and ease within the big picture in the past I was trained to desire a high-paying position from watching TV and being on social media and being exposed to successful people in my surrounding and back then my ultimate goal was to own what these people owned like money like their possessions their career path and I was very result oriented and focused on gain instead of thinking about the process and being grateful of the unfolding but now I believe that it's not really the outcome or the result that I desire but what I truly want deep down inside is the learning process of cultivating the knowledge and cultivating the skills necessary for success so I may choose to seek the conscious knowledge and I may choose to seek the step by steps to getting where I want because this knowledge and awareness brings me happiness and through that process of getting that perfect job or getting that perfect lifestyle I feel that people learn how to be confident and we all learn how to be more empowered and knowledgeable during the unfolding so for my own experience of knowing what it's like to be both the goal-oriented person as well as now being the process oriented person I believe that it's not really the striving and straining that allows me to achieve great success or happiness or freedom but what truly allows me to manifest good things in my own life is the practice of appreciating the process and the present moment so I hope that you gradually manifest your dreams your wants and needs with ease within your own pace and comfort level and I'm always here to support you and share helpful resources within this community so I'll drop a link to my career workbook and Finance workbook if you are interested if you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe to my channel thanks again for being here my friends and I hope to see you again soon you
