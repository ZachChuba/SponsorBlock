folks welcome back to another episode of eggs or eeeh as always brought to you by anyway thanks to them for sponsoring since we last left off though what has been happening is it looks like you've been doing a little bit of sifting of stuff and trying to get some more of the tiny and or dust stuff yeah I think that's I don't remember doing yeah I don't think I don't think I've done much so I think that's all that's been running is just the sifters alright well I will go toss these into the actually no i won't i won't toss them into anywhere other than just sticking them in here it didn't you need the dust or something we need to combine the dust you know didn't cause problems what i wasted a few of them okay didn't you cause a lot of issues i'm just trying to member i wasted a few he had is quiet time for you now I know I put chests in [Music] one get some coal I think yup you're saying that you saw primitive technology making charcoal the way that we made it here yes yes he makes charcoal it's actually as he's showing or he's trying to get like iron out of nothing it's later Brad he's trying to get it iron so he can eventually make an iron knife like he was doing an AMA he was talking about it but yeah there's there's like an iron bacteria that he's harvesting out of the rivers and then what is iron bacteria like it hoops iron I but he showed it all working and he only gets little cousin pearl pellets but they're just tiny little pellets for all this work but in order to distill the iron ore do to smelt it out or whatever he has to have a bunch of charcoal and he sets up it just similar to what we have here he you light it on fire and then once it kind of starts then you cover it up and it just cooks out and gets all the as he said volatiles out and leaves the slower cooking charcoal behind and then you get charcoal so huh yeah I mean you know talk about other people's channels and plug them and everything it's an interesting stuff so what what gold do I have what am I trying to do I'm not entirely sure I mean we have a decent amount of thing you want you were we were talking about the litter right and that was needing something that was painful right yeah definitely yeah that's in Indy Miam I guess I could try and oh no no no that's what I we should do is get the get that mutagen thing so why are we using the pipes from embers to pump out of this thing faster because I was connecting it into this for the sorting of the hoodies and so it's not to say that that's the better route but that's why I just tied it into that okay got chucks because I already had that sorting system set up okay it's almost like we just need kind of a buffer like it pumps out of the first chest with the embers and then it flows into kind of a chest hopper system where it just that can act as a buffer and just carry a lot more well I think with these tied down and stuff like I think we could actually hook I'll replace all this with ender pipe and just have it work because ender pipe will only go if it to a destination if it has oh really a valid connection so I think we could replace this sorting with ender pipe because of the locked nature of these compacting drawers and everything extra will go into this large chest okay I don't know for sure but I think so that's how I think so so what was the what was that the thing that you that we needed to make the B thing that we needed to make trying to remember remember it's like the mutated Tron or just oh the muta Tron I mean do we need that anymore well it's like the if we get the right bees then we can have them making Endor dust we can have them making diamonds like they become like the chickens you know or that we instead of a sifting except the bees are consumed it would be like the chickens if the chickens got consumed after they produced the resources well I think the muta Tron and being able to do all that changes that a little bit and I don't know but that's I don't know what I don't know but I think that that changes up the the combination of the grammar is saying resounding no okay he says stick to environmental but I mean hey if you want it if you will want to use bees and you have a Stockholm Syndrome going like you by all means should do it I mean I just was trying to think of things to do but if the program director says no we say no no no it's fine right now I feel like I've crushed your spirits and you really were wanting to do some peace stuff which you can do if you want to you're very accommodating thank ya um remind me the okay the dust does Otto pipe into the next okay cool yes I believe that we are actually out of the gravel though so I could just I suppose get this rolling and the iron stuff for now until we get more gravel right if that's cool do you have any objections to me filling this back out no do better give that one in there I guess distilled and alright well no and no and no and no one no do machine frames okay so apparently we could also upgrade the condenser and it would I don't know how to put more bonus stuff wait why is this not going in denser and denser what is wrong with our condensed sort of why is it not working Oh the condenser right does it need to be higher tier for the Endymion dust to work no the week I mean because we've we've used it before Oh smelt the dust oh yeah the wrong thing you're doing it wrong okay what you got to do is you got to do it right and then it works understood understood this so I need three ten blocks eighteen glass and sixty iron pipe all right so let's going in the background mysterious disc I feel like it doesn't do much for us compact or processing you were working on that right with the machine frames that you were yeah that's all I'm looking at right now okay we go through all of our Tim block said are they in somewhere else I know imported a bunch but there's not in here hmm do we want to do this a lot of mating rocks thing under well because if you're working on compact or processing the only other thing that I can do is stuff under power up I mean it's the the hemp oil and stuff was momentarily useful but I don't know if it's still useful I've changed direction on everything so it's hard for me to say rammer says fork the auto farm what about the rock crusher that allows us to automate crushing rock crusher is useful ok I need what 60 of those steel crushing how do I mean it's 48 i Caramba I'm so confused on how this is working right now yeah go ahead and sort that well I'm gonna at it it's happy to do it it's not a problem it's not a problem you for sure dude I know I know oh yeah LED plates okay I think it's this shoot needs me some sulfur think is over here I'm going to break my glass try what cool wait can I put that into the glass what my sulfur disappear oh it gave me the battery there we go there we go we good oh cool he said he mad it was confusing for a moment it's plenty glass hmm all right mental notes don't lock yourself out I don't forget how we how do you turn on the miniaturization how do you turn on the miniature just throw in the catalyst this little right there's a catalyst right okay that's right okay forget about that part Oh God crushing table requires the heart instead oh wait wait but doesn't matter right cuz we can just use this crushing table and crushing our dreams we're gonna make it automated actually it's probably yeah you might want to still have to but it's fine I'm gonna just rush this God dang it it doesn't freakin default to the right steel I wonder if there's a way to mass produce major ice stuff at all got it automated crushing um mass-produce miniaturized stuff yeah feel like since it requires you to manually place it you would need a whole bunch of manually placing things right that's where I was questioning uh-huh I need some power do we have any power wired down to here yes now where would that be located easiest place [Music] where it's right back here mmm how do I wire that power into a block you get the LV wire coil and and what is it called the LV wire connector the wire connector goes on the block and then you use the coil as a wire between the two just right click and send it around hmm don't have any LV wire coil we only have MV you can make it it's easy you see easy easy peasy copper plates and uh thing my boo thing maboob I don't say boob I said boo [Music] okay stick is well I'm trying to be mindful of clearing stuff if I can in the text fields so do we is it gonna look bad if I like have wire running over should I just put the rock crusher like kind of near this thing yeah I'd put it near it and especially it you might want to make it insulated wire so it doesn't hurt us every time we touch it okay it's like uh on a second or I mean I do you is there a reason not to put that in the machine room I I guess it I guess we can put a machine room oh that's yeah that's fine whatever dude I'll put it up here it's chill it's chill all righty in that situation they got LD wire Connacht or and the L the whole wire coil and it's getting power I mean our um V on all these desert no no those that are insulated that's why they're oh okay these are these you can touch just fine yeah I can't touch him just fine you can touch over here you're still touching the wire over there okay okay so you you have one live wire exposed that's fun times okay so does that mean with this crusher I could crush say colistin how's this work so you have a crusher or a rock crusher I don't know exactly what I throw in there but see I guess it's something that could potentially be useful for reasons I never use the bad guys if this is all easy stuff oh that's Oh any workbench okay and you device frames so that's easy and that's easy and that's easy used to be the we can make stuff easier but now we can't wedding goods oops what do you do so the the X in this is not clear it's craft a stack so something note the wait what what happened so just just keep that in mind in the future what in in the modular storage the the crafting it does actually say craft a stack by the way I didn't hover and read I said one four eight and I saw ax and was like clear but I think that's supposed to be no it's not that's an infinity how many of a what did you just craft redstone servos don't worry about it and worry about it it's fine and we kinda have to the stack of them 64 the matter of fact yeah those did you need one but we got it alright yeah how many resources were just wasting listen I feel like you're looking at this the wrong way do you yeah okay listen you can be positive or you can be negative do you want to be negative yep alright then I've got a factorize herbicides you might we might end up met using that like I know we they're used in some secondary things yeah but like all the secondary things I you know I mean it's a red servos used an 8 pages worth of things so we might end up using it again mm-hmm you could look at the bright side of life mm-hmm all right so I'm missing everything okay I need a piston do I have what it takes to make a piston no I'm missing everything cool okay have we got any diamond to dust to going over here now perhaps a little bit this doesn't do or dicta for a second I thought there was only obsidian in that but then I realized that no you just search oh yes I was just searching sorry about that it's okay wait this isn't sorting by whoa all right I am trying to figure out what the days that we I guess oh my god did this actually already sift through all of the freaking stuff that's incredible Wow I need to go mine some more ash yeah oh wow dude so this is I just need two slabs or not okay and slabs [Music] should be that one oh god this is oh yeah that's just the circuit board and the gold nuggets circuit board is two vacuum tubes I'm gonna put those there for now Oh we'll make a dedicated flexible shovel for digging ash and stone chips and mop worst idea in the world and not the worst idea oh you need an axe pickle I see so it was like you had an idea but then it turned out to not be an idea no someone in chat recommend doing it but I guess the only way that you get all the modifiers and stuff that you need is if you have the ex pickle got it do you got it though I want you you made a crusher right I yeah rock crusher or a crushing table is we have both well I'm wondering if I can buy thank you see your name sure I am wondering if we can have a machine crush magma rock for us rather than us now oh yeah I bet if you throw it in the rock crusher it'll do what that do I just got to figure out are these all connected or they each on their own what do you mean the these combined store modular storage things you but they're all on their own okay yeah cool unfortunately I could not see a way to make that be all interconnected which would be great cuz then you could just auto craft anything you wanted oh nice and this doubles it up - yeah oh it has a option a secondary chance got it what's that I was crushing so I was crushing it man but I was crushing some magma rack and saw the first one gave me two and I was a Commodore doubles and then the next one only gave me one that was confused but then I figured out so it does actually work ya know it yes it definitely works okay cool sure there's no question that it's working very very exciting to hear much excite god I cannot believe that this void minor thing requires the sheer amount of resources it what have you done hold please transdimensional travel after this babble done we'll be right back yeah things back alright we're up to 17 and dim iam no listen right crystals oh okay you put the literate crystal in the I see now we get it mm-hmm now like get it get it bit late put it and doing me up in there and then and now I get it okay so now I'm gonna convert this stuff into what we need to do all right goods we're getting ever so much closer to that little right good good oh okay wait if we upgrade to steel and the condenser we only need 13 to 15 oh okay oh yeah I remember being told I should upgrade that from Ray that's a steal I remember that all right well that's what I will do then okay the old condenser a and there's nothing else that we have to actually change with it I think it's just updating the that piece steel condenser is theirs yeah it's 70% single whoa n stone condenser efficiency six hundred and sixty percent oh my goodness and there you have that yet and dear iam condenser efficiency six hundred eighty percent speed eight hundred percent definitely seem is higher than what we've currently got I'm not you know miles and miles and miles how we are okay I think so all right well we definitely have this though we definitely have what we have all right some stuff uh this how it needs to be a casing to this is just free power it's all wind baby you can't wind up my plan yeah gonna wind things down you know mm-hmm all right let's see i'ma try to do this press thing here the press thing let's see there yeah that's what you like to see easy wait yeah how did teru teru bozu get all kawaii what yeah hectare interior those who got super kawaii I don't know what these words are bro I learned this freakin past couple days when I was at the YouTube summit thing that okay have you heard of a YouTube channel called the Kizuna eh or Kizuna i or however you pronounce it exactly have you heard of this oh my god dude it just reminded me because I was saying I was kawaii and and definitely Kizuna used the term kawaii when when he was at the YouTube summit thing oh my god dude so this is apparently it's a thing it's called a V tuber and it's a person they like body act and then in real time they have software that like motion captures them onto a character and he has a voice changer too so he's like doing his speaking and and body acting and then he on the on the TV once it's processed it shows up as this anime girl who speaks in a girl voice and it's like oh my god bro what in the world this I've never heard of this and it's absolute insanity and apparently like a freaking celebrity in Japan it's wild it's absolutely wild but we had a little conversation with Kizuna through the through translator on it like somehow they had it set up so like he was in the greenroom and he had his set up with him and it was being shown on a TV and he could see us in the room even though he we only saw the TV that had his like the character Kizuna anime girl and is just what how are you doing this in real time we're we're carrying out a conversation you like look around you know where the people aren't be able to look in the anime girl would look in that direction too and it's just holy crap anyway all this from teru teru bozu it's you even heard of this no no no look it up look it up and you're gonna be like wait it is happening okay so do I break this I guess and then just have this stuff flow everywhere yeah don't know how that know how the water is is or flowing that way but uh yeah there we go all right let's see is this gonna work now um always much faster he's much faster too oh that's where that went so what I like to see dude make an instant when it's not that hard and use way more dyes for does is it not that hard to get in stone I think it's hard for us to get in stone I'm not sure how would we get n stone honestly okay cool I mean a copper plate n stone is resonant ender with a sandstone yeah we can't make that very easily are you not gonna go and look up cuz in a I know no one no oh my god I can't believe that you aren't intrigued by the fact that it's like had it's just it's wild it's a deal like it's a dude with his laptop and emotion capturing and and and therefore it's of tease the freaking celebrity in Japan he's big in Japan right it's crazy dude oh these little rights are just hammering out this is sick like I got into the wrong line of work dude yeah yeah like I have to be here on camera why did I do that why I do that to myself I could have just gotten something else where I don't ever have to be present it can be a computer that does it for me dude coming soon jarred on AI I am I will be anime girl that's interesting I will be everybody's and am a girlfriend okay he offers himself as tribute mmm-hmm don't you want me is your anime girlfriend hard pass also he does sound like really cute through that it's really weird like I don't know how I don't know how you sound that cute it's like it's just it just sounds like anime character it's it's anyway just look it up everybody who's confused and be more confused because I was confused too bro we got 30 literate and Counting this the steel steel condenser was an absolute clutch clutch idea sounds sounds like you have some confusion I mean it's it's it's it's natural to be confused about it might confuse about I you were just saying it was confusing you literally just finished talking about how you were confused I'm just gonna make the Mysteria disc I'm just gonna make it do l we only have three and our turtle oh and good have to use an enduro dust in order to do that in order to do that in order to do today do dad dude I guess I'll have to do it after the Luther rate ends so that's fine yeah pretty much just waiting on the litter right you feel free to make fanart of us as anime girls Alexis stop all right we order ourselves a little bit of food Sookie doodles dude okay everyone's like no [Laughter] hazing do you want to be an anime waifu in van art with me both of us is anime wife is all right so you have some redstone circuits underway I hopefully can use those soon zine doesn't want to be an anime waifu and i think that's all i have cooking right now so we're just gonna put this ash back good good it's gonna be like the the old spark ant stuff except anime so bad so bad we pushed him over the edge guys ha ha ha he's gone he's all gone he could still hear me he's not deafened what do I do now guys I'm just waiting on that little right we're gonna definitely have a know so that's a super exciting guy why didn't we make the steel casing before why not indeed how's life my dude I'm I'm fine how are you just been getting some ash yeah you're still you're okay everything's fine I'm good no problems no all right glad to hear it never been better really yeah never no that's not true I was gonna be very very impressed by that I mean like honestly I think if anything is be saddened by that like if this was it if this is the best as I've got I mean I'd be kind of flattered personally but whatever okay well yeah I had nowhere to go with that that wasn't just like rude not even like funny rude but like like today you know we were we were talking about you and you were like why are you talking about me and I just like because of our mutual respect wasn't you're making fun of you and it was and but you know but then there's just a line where it just mean I mean I'm never about being mean mm-hmm yeah Azim doesn't even like to take the El dancing fortnight he gets very upset I don't get upset by it like you do you can do it if you want I don't trying to do it I you expressed great shame every time that I did it take the El dance I think that we can be better you know zyne just judging everybody silently I think it's appropriate to be empathetic towards people that you've been playing with even if you've won mm-hmm dude everything is so dry right now sucks yeah I mean it's like you've seen like more and more fires and going I hope okay I need to put lotion on my hands like all the time in order for my skin I have to tape it up so it doesn't just crack and yeah tough it's tough huh and I started giving me that glass by the way no no I just put it down did we need and I think I need two more covering play things 84 Aletha right - yes we are getting very close very close indeed we are at how many now we are at a B I just need four more Endymion and in Hindi DD DD and dinner in an hour all right so I take these four and then oh there we go I'm gonna go up here a new way of resource gathering which we won't have enough power to run I don't even know if we need all that stuff but I'm going to toss this huh he's gonna toss this just goes and goes and goes and goes okay what is the next step that's a lot don't we have brick somewhere that's a lot of things that need to be made right there oh boy the old void miner dealio that's always a fun time that's always a fun time void miner tier 1 don't forget void miner dealio break some D's brick yes there whoa we're at a glass holy mother of trucker I realize this you can see you can solve this this is a solvable problem I realize this but I'm saying I was not expecting it to take place is all you weren't expecting it oh wait you don't water that already oh dear Oh all right and then I needed more chipsets which needed more redstone which needed more Boom Boom's did need more Boom Boom's that's for sure I mean easiest you have been sneezy Asst sneezy a sponson easy redstone go we were out of redstone borough oh I wonder why we're out of redstone why oh well yeah that helped that didn't help yeah but I made some more yeah that did that I happen to use a stack of redstone by any chance a little bit yeah uh-huh don't worry about it because you also took like 14 blocks of redstone for your ax pick poles and stuff so it's all good we all out here what I don't want to leave that just going cuz the tanks full right it's cool oh no the tanks no we're fine we're fine well no it's being consumed as we go but anyway okay okie dokie I just wish these this assembly table laser thing would work a bajillion times faster I don't enjoy that very much there's that and what is it copper plate yeah two chips it's okay steel hey so that puts that in there I Caramba hi remember wait no we do not got sealed plates just smelt those down and put them into freakin oh wait can I stamp out plates oh yeah no I can just hammer out the plates oh that's good and then I need Deweyville lumen we do yah yes of course yah yah eat I'm swearing through all of our ash my back go in what why get some plate pressing yeah aluminum doesn't did work the way you wanted it to work so I've determined like the way that you were trying to make it work it's not how that works mm-hmm okay so how many of these do I need like holy cannoli he's not 30 no it says it means that we broke right there considering all these others are still in good shape that's a he might not have replaced that okay 32 and 16 my god talking about my god murder okay that's enough oh we already have aluminum plates so we're fine there was that that's enough for me what are we use counting to yourself mm-hmm okay think we're talking to yourself that's fine all right no the two gold and mostly puts up just trying to understand what's going on what I'm encountering what I'm seeing just world in front of me is a magical place and I want to know where this thing went [Music] your wire keeps shocking me that's good no it made it boy I am loving those things um okay well cool all right there we go hey quest complete you did it that's what I try to do I try doing it you don't think you could do that yeah dude I don't know you do oh look I just did one of the weights okay hopefully those are all interchangeable and we get a crescent hammer hey that's the that's the one hand that I like the Kristin hammer yeah yeah all right now to figure out which of these things oh okay so that's where the LV stuff is insulated in here I'm just following after you with your already typed in things yes there it is stick Frick stick and Frick Hans and Franz so wait does that mean that I could take this guy and put them moments sake that there this had an LV in it we're doing weird one boy okay now there's no way this works I mean it doesn't give us extras but it still does oh that's nice oh no I might have messed up Wow again yeah I made far too many of how did you waste some resources right should I be unwilling to let it go and you know just keep harassing you about it I didn't make it a whole stack extra though yeah yeah wait mmm Oh rammer says I need a fork ton anyway so cool so all good yep everything is fine everything is awesome [Music] hmm okay so at least that you know we could set up some hoppers do some things set that up real nice but the question is does that mean I mean I can't pour it out in two pieces which is kind of boo-boo but still just getting straight stuff that's pretty nice Whateley Oh does that mean that I need the compactor to turn it into ingots is that how that works oh it's the factorize er interesting which is right here so we have a factorize er Frick you okay everything all right yeah we are we having a problem no ow out out out out okay I'm good no not good oh all right almost came good everything okay yeah I had a thing but we're you know sorry that happened you okay yeah it was you know yeah you get it oh how do I make this little right stuff that's right I don't actually know how to make leather right how do I make with right if it can't I don't know how to make little right dude that seems it seems like a step you forgot No Oh yep yep okay all right I guess that's a thing yeah well that's nice just kind of do do all of them in real with the radar yes hey eh eh eh eh eh eh it's so pretty it's pretty it's so pretty Wow what did you do oh I'm smelting and making things into ingots whoa all right I made a void or minor controller that step one now I need 24 structure frame tier ones but think about step two wait that's wait that was a lie that was a lie why did it ask me to do 84 little right crystals if I needed like five thousand just to make sure that knew how you know how to get you going oh I can turn them back oh okay okay okay we're good god I was gonna be upset about that don't stop being upset you're fine oh god I need to make way more interconnect you're telling me that every single structure frame requires one interconnect so what you're saying is that we've nearly 50,000 steals and aluminum's um you know how I was saying that oops I made too many yeah didn't make too many didn't make too many huh just the right amount no I'm about 5% there maybe okay it's it's going well hey go ahead and remove my recipe yes I will absolutely love to do that it's fine I would you know cool cool here to help let me know your you're fine you're fine do you do your deal okay you freaking deal Braille okay just gonna just make just make a few of those I guess not I didn't I could not like this very much oh yeah we're gonna we're gonna need a lot of redstone to like allay a lot of it oh so did give me one like all the Redstone I okay what do you currently am in possession of all the right stone for the time being but we're gonna need even more of all of it all of it alright well have you been making sure to keep it going as it were cool so 24 which means I have enough to make six of those and then what else i structure panels I wonder what those require structure panel is oh good it's just a few more of the connectors that's very good so five more of the connectors and then laser core and clearly is Erlinda wonder what those require laser core I use a couple more connectors now clearly their lens is that's actually easy what a surprise actually easy is me you can't tell this is worse than septet or hot oh I can't this is a bar this is far worse and oh yeah not even any question on whether one is like septic got pretty technical but was also not this nope okay okay I got six interconnects that's very exciting and then I use those interconnects alongside lap ease and stuff and then own more lift or right and then I just do all that okay this is going very well I can think of nothing else that could be going any better than this good that's I mean it certainly didn't sound sarcastic so not at all no no things are going well think it was in any way shape or form no no no we oh we're gonna need a lot more of the dust powder though well see this thing is that redstone I we had a lot of dust powder but it goes right into the system that you didn't want to turn off so it just gets instant so you gotta turn it off if you want to get to it hey I know I understand Oh 21 more Reds don't know so that's very nice yeah I tried to keep it going thanks Mel so but I've been collecting and smashing Magna rack hmm over in the rock crusher yes except it it has been utilized oh boy what a time to be alive and by alive I mean demonetised inside from all of the tediousness that goes into this particular step demonetised inside every now and then a fellow gets demonetised okay watch people d monetize inside is a subreddit that i haven't checked out in quite some time yeah mm-hmm that one's all like good and bad simultaneously yeah simultaneously like the well that sucks subreddit it's also good and bad simultaneously not not only is that but like at this like at the same time right not only that but simultaneously yes mm-hmm yeah you get it I get it I've known I'm known for my acts of getting things you hate I wouldn't have guessed that about you well if you don't believe it yeah no I mean every time I've ever cracked a joke you immediately gotten it mhm yeah you're given your lip easily and the no I don't know I'm good I'm a lot these lazuli I think but basically yet just need just need to use up all of the aluminum and steel that we could ever want ever so that was what was it 32 and 16 ended up making freaking six sets eight eight carry the one I'm doing math and your basis is all of it all of it do it man I've come to the conclusion that the ants is all of it yeah he's safe right now though thank God he's in a bowling alley actually you know we'll just don't we'll just do 32 for now that means we'll need to do 64 aluminium aluminium in a moment fortunately lots of aluminium in a room so that's like not a problem at all but where we run into the problem is tell me what are we running to the problem I'm about to do that so we run into the problem when it comes to steel yeah yeah it seems like steel would be a problem is it it is actually we we definitely need to make more steel pretty much but iron actually is not a problem right we have lots of iron oh yeah that's right awesome iron so that's the positive side here is I'm gonna take a stack of iron and get it going in a steel okay yeah makes sense like where we don't need where we have an excess of iron and a dearth per se a dearth steel a dearth is that actually a lack of that is in fact like oh I love that word so much yeah yes you took to it just immediately I love that word this is this is my word these are my people it's a it's a great word dude I want to I want to hear dearth more often all right now you're making me feel like I need to look it up to verify that I'm using it it's gonna be really very significant nothing like it I know it's something like it but I don't know like usually if I could mess up something like that then it's like it's a very specific situation like it's in politics or something like like you know so I'm applying it to the wrong context even though I'm using it from the right idea is what will usually happen there but
