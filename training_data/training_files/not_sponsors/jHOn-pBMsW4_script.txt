so I hear this group is supposed to be pretty underrated and I've heard their visual Queens legendary vocals two iconic dancers the music sounds like anime top class music videos I mean what can I say about your contra at this point you'll know I stand I can't say anything that the other reactors don't already say all the time you know what I mean like every reactor that I see they say the same stuff about dreamcatcher but so the matter is it's because it's true [Music] this is dreamcatcher rose blue apparently it's an OST for a video game I think it's called like girl gun cafe I'm so curious about what this game actually is now this is the first picture that pops up anyway I've never played the game but if anything's gonna get me to try it out it's gonna be dreamcatcher so their last OST was a banger and a half in deja vu one of the best songs of the year last year and I fully expect nothing less out of them this time unfortunately there's no lyrics available on the video so I'm just gonna watch it straight up I'm assuming like deja vu there's gonna be some sort of story being told throughout this video so I'm gonna watch it once pay mostly attention to the to the audio and the second time through I'm gonna pay more attention to best etics and the story that's being told [Music] to matter Gio [Music] you really shouldn't stare into the Sun like that damn it is already so video gaming is this like the Gio show today I mean I'm not complaining girl looks good nice slow Melanie to start us out now we're double timing on the drums kion look like a cutie as always [Music] even shall be [Music] where you going with this gun girl damn their visuals are always so crazy just a light [Music] that crystal totally reminds me of the crystal from deja vu right no scream like except small you know the one that explodes on kion but this rock sound is definitely a lighter version of it very reminiscent of adamak shocking right [Music] [Music] I think I hear violins [Music] damn is awesome we got [Music] okay so so far I just want to point out what I have noticed in this video is that they all seem to be like separated into their own rooms so we got suet chained up we got we had xi'an here I don't know what she's holding it looks like a whale stuffy I don't know what's going on yet I'm gonna have to watch more of this to figure it out but uh just on that chorus man that chorus was pretty fired I'm not gonna lie they did stuff in there that I wasn't expecting them to do just to the some of the chords that they went to the progression of them not basic at all it wasn't the four chord progression that you normally hear in very poppy choruses this is a very poppy chorus but they're playing around with it some violins in the background keyboards in the background they're going all out they're going ham on this thing feeling it [Music] it's like a post-chorus what is this I'm gonna say it again when she says rose blue it sounds exactly like the last thing that you would hear in an anime theme song before the show starts [Music] dami time oh totally different vibes from everything else happens visually and audio but she was alone also just like other ones [Music] face work in the background man sounds good dude you guys gotta listen on that though right there just pay attention in the background for a second the bass just like at the very light like the last two seconds of each line [Music] oh it's hard to acoustic guitar [Music] why should trying to kill everybody they seem kind of okay women [Music] sever sewers [Music] what is going on I got chills [Applause] [Music] Cayenne is extra smiling in this video and I think everybody is ok with us [Music] [Applause] dude listen this bridge holy like also what the hell is happening on the screen but that bridge was insane we got to hear that again that was out of nowhere - I hear a saxophone in there - dude they're crazy [Music] Wow dude this piece right here is like a masterwork and Instrumentation fire [Music] yo we got a whole actress here today [Music] no boy hold on dude this whole thing has been an experience what is happening wait a minute a dreamcatcher a butterfly dude had love how she says that holy this really was kind of like the Jewish show wasn't it in my time is dreamcatcher a fan realized that butterflies do seem to get attributed to GU a lot so I have a feeling that had something to do with that right there now listen I have some theories on what happened in that video I don't know if I want to talk about them until I watch it one more time I was so I was tricked it was so hard to just pay attention to this song or the video because both of them were doing all kinds of crazy but uh here's my small theory before I watch the video I'm like really focus on it I don't think the G R was being evil at all in that situation it seemed to me like all of her mates were stuck in these like areas these rooms she went into each of those places with that gun aimed it at them I'm guessing shot them but then at the end she wanted to shoot herself also after they had all disappeared I'm wondering if this is like a matrix situation you know like it's are they in like an alternate reality and that crystal has something to do with it and G was like got her portal gun like shooting them to the other side I don't know man let me just get my bearings okay so this is the ending scene also right where they all disappear and she's left alone they're in the same spot and since they all disappeared I'm thinking that's like that's like an alternate reality you know and the real world is where the crystal is blue hair with blue eyed you [Music] I'm trying to figure out what each room represents for each of them this is school room yeah they're always sleeping right it's almost like this crystal brought them to a different reality I don't I don't understand this room either I understand this room the guy is right are they possibly like fears like I don't know what this fear would be though why is she holding a well man what's the well it's probably not even well gee you were realized while they were all outside in that like that in that field with the Sun coming down it was almost like she realized something was wrong and it allowed her to I don't know snap out of whatever like hypnosis that this crystal has put them all into she wasn't even in the room though I got to think about that this S&M right here all the butterflies come out I love how she says that oh my god now she's in there dude okay so I'm I I feel pretty comfortable saying that I was right about that so she's just like entered at the crystal and now she's gonna go to each of the girls and shoot them with this thing which is gonna bring them out of their stasis into the real world but then she doesn't shoot herself to the end she hasn't shoot herself at the end because there's no bullets left she gets stuck there she sacrifices herself right is that what's happening this scene is like out of nowhere yeah I can't equate it with anything else that's going on my question is do the other girls know that they're in this place in this crystal [Music] Aion seems to be like Conn seems to like kind of know right like she kind of seems like she understands that G was there for good [Music] oh my god she looks so cute see now it's like she saved them all right but then they all disappear oh that that face panda gonna cry dude I swear to God if we don't get a part two I'm gonna lose my I'm gonna be so pissed off this requires a part too far more than scream does in my opinion honestly like I was so enthralled with the story that was going on there and the fact that they're gonna leave us out on this lake geo from my perspective at least it looks like Gio sacrificed herself to save the other members from this like alternate reality they can't just leave her in that crystalman where's doggy where's Hong Kong well you gotta get her over to save the day right like I don't know man anyway guys yeah I'm out of here like comment and subscribe for onion
