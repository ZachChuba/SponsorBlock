Hello, Miracle. For Oh My Girl's Sketchbook, I'm here to shoot for Pilates S Magazine today. You know I've been doing Pilates passionately. I'm still not that good at it. But as a gym fanatic, I'm very honored to take part in this project. What should I do? Let's put the prop down. There's no memory card. Cute, fresh! I like it. STAFF : You're doing well. So good.
HYOJUNG : Thank you. So you want me to look sentimental..? I thought it's cute because of the double hair buns But they want me to look nostalgic, apparently. Wake up. Wake up. We can do it. Good. It feels like I'm lying on a lotus leaf. A bit uncomfortable, but it's okay. Because I prefer to use high pillows. There's no pillow here. I have this much hair. Miracle. I want to tell you something. Would you take my heart? I think I'm born for Miracles. I like the timbre of ARIN's voice, sung like this. Like she's about to cry. This part here. Like, yeah~ YOOA flows with the rhythm. When YOOA sings, I can feel the rhythm in there. So when I listen to YOOA singing, I get excited too. Her singing makes me hyped up. YOOA's really good at that. SEUNGHEE sounds so emotional. It's like... She's witnessed the universe. She's like... Listen. Breath 80%. And BINNIE does the most dramatic part of our song. So BINNIE's voice is fit for the dramatic feeling. When I think of JIHO, Her voice is like a clean cloud. Her voice is so pure and clear. It's like... The sugar coating around tanghulu. Like when I hit the sugar coating, and it cracks. MIMI's rapping voice is really cool. But her singing voice is so cute. When she's like, na na na! I keep thinking of her mouth shape... MIMI sings like this. She has her own innocent feeling. So our 7 members are like that. How interesting. You may not catch ARIN's voice color. But if you listen carefully, her voice is so sad. That's why I like her voice. It feels fragile but it won't break. Like glass. Ta-da. The photo shoot is finally over! For this photo shoot, I worked out and also dieted. So I wish the results would be pretty. The set and crew made me feel so good, I'm very satisfied today. Thank you, Miracle. Bye!
