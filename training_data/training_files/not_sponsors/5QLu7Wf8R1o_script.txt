(OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) I'm back in Gangnam. I've been in Gangnam for a week now. I'm always in Gangnam these days. My manager said she's going to get someone. When will she get back? Oh, they're here! (Awkward acting) Hello... I'm Solji's manager. Did you say Solji? (The leader of EXID, the group that turned
the K-Pop world upside down with ) (YangPang x Solji???) (Is this really happening?) I heard you'll be her manager for one day. Am I being a manager again? What happens? Do I go now? Yes, we can leave right now. (Troublemaker manager, here we go!) (Buying beverages for Solji)
And please give me one watermelon juice. Would you like to drink something, manager? No, I'm good. Okay~ (Never asks twice) What's Solji's schedule today? We're going to Ilsan MBC today. Do I get to visit a major network today? - Yes, you do.
- Really? Do I get to be on camera too? Uhh... You won't me on camera... Oh, really? Darn... Can you drive? Yes, I can! I have a license. But, if I did... We'd probably drive straight to the hospital. Oh, okay... I'll do it then. (Doesn't wanna die today) (Buying gimbap for Solji) (Feeling anxious) Hello~ (Playing doorman while waiting for today's star) (Almost like a sasaeng/stalker fan) She's coming down! Hello~ - Hello.
- Hello! (It's Solji for real!) - I'm here to escort you.
- Hello, hello. - So you'll be my manager for the day?
- Yes! That's right. Let's have a good day. Just a minute. I bought watermelon juice for you to drink. Thank you so much. My name is YangPang... It's nice to meet you. Oh, your hands are so small and adorable. (Nothing to do but laugh) I heard you need to buy some lens. Yes... - Manager.
- Yes? Let's go buy some lens. Sure thing. So this is how it's gonna be? So you're like a head manager that will
order Kihwan around today? - Well...
- Right? - I've skipped up the ladder a bit.
- Ah, okay. (The YangPang talk show is in full swing)
That's when you went back up the charts and was booming... To tell you how big it was at the time... Excuse me, manager. - Please do something about those vibrating noises.
- Oh, yes... Sorry... (I think Solji likes YP teasing her manager! lol) (Manager Boomer Pang) Oh, Kihwan. You're gonna have a long day today. She's like your seonbae! I have two celebrities today... - Please take good care of her, Kihwan.
- Yes, ma'am. You'll have to be calling me all day today so just call me Pang. Pang manager? Yes... Pangman Pangman! Wanpangman? (Laughing at everything she says lol) One Pang... - We're tight on time.
- Oh, really? Then if you get hungry... If we get hungry along the way... If we get too hungry, we just eat in the car. I heard the manager eats expensive food. Solji: Me?
Manager: Huh? He said he's gonna eat premium beef today. I think wagyu was on the menu. As soon as your shoot starts, he runs out and... (Nom Nom Nom) It's gonna be a long day for Kihwan. (The sacrificial lamb for today) - He's not like that...
- Oh, really? I become like bipolar when I get drunk... (Every time she drinks...) - Oh, really?
- Yes. Do you normally have bipolar disorder? I don't mean I have a disorder... I just mean like... - Did I take it too seriously?
- Yes... What kind of impression did I leave on you? (She figured out you're a weirdo) Wait, isn't this supposed to be a manager experience? It's suddenly become a live talk show. (They've been talking for over an hour) You haven't eaten yet, right? No, but I'm okay. Do you wanna share this with me? No, I'm okay. So you can have wagyu later? (Bingo) Kihwan, keep a close eye on her. Yes, ma'am. (Yum) (LOL, those eyes...) It hurts inside~ Please eat up~ - Do you wanna hear my song?
- Yes! (Solji's new song dropped close to the making of this vid) I was waiting for you to ask. It's raining~ It's raining~ On a day that's filled with the scent of the rain~ I'm sure I'll be this way for some time~ Feeling down and all zoned out~ (Zoned out like this) ("Rains Again" by Solji) (Superstar Solji is here) (Waiting here was worth it!) Let me get that for you. (South Korean Foreigners / Solji)
(They finally got here after 2 hours) Solji, would you like me to dress you? No~ I'm good~ You're good? (You look like a sasaeng fan again) (Solji's reading through the script) (Bored) Oh, you're in the middle of a shoot. Yes... I'm the manager. You're a manager??? Whose manager? Solji's manager. Why do you look more like a celebrity then? What? - Goodness.
- How long have you been a manager? What do you normally do? I'm a YouTuber... I'm doing this for content... Oh, this is for Point of Omniscient Interfere. Umm... it's not... Be my manager for the day. What? Will you pay me? I mean for the right price... I could pay you in subscribers. - Subscribers?
- Yes. I'll take your subs, please lend me some. Is it true that there are only scumbags at the major networks? (Scumbag over scumbag) (Please don't cause any trouble as you walk in...) (Goddess) (Staring at her getting her makeup) Solji, you have to sign these first. Who are these for? This one's for ebay. (Scumbag ON) - Am I doing rehearsals now?
- Yes, rehearsals now... (She's given something to do) (Run, Orangee) (Water delivery) - Thank you!
- You're welcome. Give it your best! Hwaiting. (Lies down right after) (RIP YangPang) (After just 3 hours, we laid Orangee to rest) (YangPang's manager: Freeeeeeedddddommmmm!) (Learning Solji's new song) (Peek) (Shock) (Jumps up) (She's back!) What were you doing? - I was listening to your song.
- Oh, were you? The song's great. But how do you sing the chorus? Is that it? (This is the original version) (How is this the same song?) If you implant that in my mind... I can promote the song to PDs and other people I meet. - The chorus?
- Yes, I'll sing it for them. Okay... It must be coz of all the rain that's pouring down~ It's not coz I really wanted to point it out~ It's not coz I particularly miss you now~ I'm just feelin' a little down~ How on earth am I supposed to sing this? I'll try this time. (If you don't quit smoking today, there is no tomorrow) (YangPang's been accused of being a smoker for the past 5 years...) (Utter shock) (Let's hear it from the artist) Just up to here. - Just that one line?
- Yes! - I think I can do that.
- You can, right? Yes. Do you wanna try? What is this? A bug? (Confirmed: YangPang is a sasaeng fan) Staff: Time to go~ Yes, coming~ What will you be doing while I'm gone? I'll be promoting your song. How will you sing it? (What the?) Very good. (Given up) Solji: So cute! (Mission: Fix Solji's mic cord) (Mission: Raise Solji's leg???) You don't have to go that far. Pangman, there's no need to do that. She's only doing it coz the cameras are rolling. (Show window manager) Give me the other foot. You're so pretty!!! So pretty! Do I look okay? Look out for me too. Yes... - Give it your best!
- Oh, okay. - Hwaiting!
- Okay, okay. Let's go now. Korean food? Does everyone want Korean food? (The most difficult mission for a rookie manager:
Deciding what to eat for the staff) I'm heading out. I'll go get the food. What? This is taking too long. (Explodes in the end) (Seoul life is hard) Why are you looking so pitiful? (Miserable) (It's way past dinner time) It's a little tiring. I think I smell instant noodles. - What?
- I smell instant noodles. So I ate some instant noodles! So what? I ate some noodles! I had some time so I ate! (Manager: What the hell?) YangPang's manager: Let me apologize. - I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. (Finally time to eat) If you sit there by yourself... While everyone's sitting like this... She's even sitting on the floor... Let's go get some chairs at least. Oh, chairs... (Growl) Do managers have to do stuff like this too? Since they're our staff. We need to make them comfortable. Not long to go now. (Buying the staff drinks)
Strawberry juice? Strawberry juice sounds good. Manager, shouldn't you be promoting the song? I should... So why don't you? (Are you scolding him?) Let's do a duet later on the street. Okay! You start. Me? Yes, start right now. So that everyone can hear. (I'm Solji's manager, I can do this!) Where you going? (Betrayed on the spot) YAH!!! (He explodes in the end) (Working hard to promote the song) You're good. (Found some random people)
I'm Solji's manager for the day. These are Solji's fans. Oh, for real??? You're actual Solji fans? - You know Solji's new song...
- Yes! I'm promoting it right now. May I sing you a line? Yes, sure. (Stops) Sure that's the right song? (Do it right!) It must be coz of all the rain that's falling down~ It's "pouring" down. (Owned) Hold up, I'll carry that. I'll carry that for you. Phew. (Peek) The actual managers... They make me do all the work. All by myself... I carried all this by myself. (Sc*mb*g) Hello~ Hello. Nice to meet you.
(It's Sam Okyere!) Solji's released a new song. I wanted to sing you a line. It sounds so different though. He heard the actual version earlier. Time to greet Solji since she's done. Great work. Good work, everyone. (Thumbs up!) Good work, everyone. You waited for ages, right?
Isn't it tiring? No, I'm okay. - You look like you slept.
- I did a bit. (It wasn't just a bit) - You worked really hard today.
- Thank you... How was it today? Working as my manager today? I realized it once again... Life is not easy. - You're right. Nothing's easy in life.
- Right. For me... Pangman and her quirky ways... She felt like a cute dongseng. I felt energized from your presence. I had so much fun. Thank you... You really worked hard today
promoting my song. I really did work hard. Can you sing it one more time? (Hmm) Can't you sing it with me just once? Yes, with the real manager~ - Realman and Pangman!
- We should sing it together. Show us how it's done. I'll do the soprano, you do the alto. Ready, go! (Editor: I can't stand any more...) (Let's just listen to this) It's her first solo comeback in ages. I'll do my part to promote the song! It's been ages since her comeback. I hope the song's a huge hit. Always be healthy. I heard it's going to rain on July 9
when "Rains Again" is released, So I'm really looking forward to it. I hope the song's a hit! Unni, I hope it becomes a song that
people listen to when it rains. Hwaiting! I LOVE YOU! I love you! I love you~ Solji, hwaiting! Pangman was the best today. YangPang, hwaiting! Thank you! (Thanks so much to Solji and all the staff for today) What was that? You need a manager? Call me! (We're waiting for celebrities with exceptional patience)
