hey what is going on you guys that is mr. no sleep here from old school runescape and welcome to a brand new video for you all today so in today's video I bring you guys loot from 3,000 Dagon death kings and at first I wanted to do this video individually you know 1000 of each boss in its own video however I decided that why not just kill 1000 of every single Dagon of King and make it 3,000 overall so you guys get the best of every single King themselves and maybe just maybe we can get a pet during this video seeing is that we're gonna be killing so many of them and since prior to making this video my tagging of King Casey was already over 8,000 and we still to this day had not gotten any pet that would be the main goal for this video but putting pets aside I did also have the Diaries completed so that every single tagging of king that we were going to be killing throughout this video would drop me noted bones as well as the awesome drop rate of all of the rings that you can get here I knew that no matter what would happen with the pets I was still going to be making a lot of money and it would definitely be a great video ahead today's video they are awesome and I really do appreciate it right so here we are 3,000 Dagon of Kings this is the start and let me tell you it will go by quicker than you can imagine so let's get started we have a lot to talk about for this video the first things first you know in order to get here you always have to remember those two important things one of them being the pet rock and the other one being the room throwing axe got to bring that pet rock to balance another stone in order to open a door to reach the well I guess one of the many rooms that you have to go through to get to Dagon of Kings and of course you have to bring that room throwing axe to break down another door in order to go down a ladder to reach these diagonal kings so make sure to always bring those two items they are very important especially if you're soloing and as you can see in our very first soloing trip we did actually get a warrior ring then take too long currently at a price of 63 K so it is the least expensive ring that you can get down here from these Dagon of Kings and of course followed by the second least valuable rare that being the dragon axe currently as the making of this video goes at a price of 80k so you know not a great start but those two items just kind of give you a basic idea of some of the rare drops that you can get from these stagnant Kings you can also get some uncommon drops such as dragon med Helms hard clues scrolls as well as elite clues scrolls and we did save every single casket from every single elite and every single hard clues scroll during this video for the end so you guys will see alongside all the drops all of the cou scroll caskets being open at the end of the video as always and some more uncommon drops you know those being seer coal one of the most useless range weapons in the game I believe the special attack on that seer coal is used to lower an opponent's magic level so I think it's used in castle wars or some things like that our second ring coming in not too long after the first one and that being of course warrior ring number two and the only thing worse than two warrior rings is three warrior rings so yeah the first three all being the worst of them all but again I wasn't too caught up in that you know there's a lot of Dagon if King kills to go and you know this was the very start so the first 500 kills wasn't looking too good but the next 100 we're looking at much better as you can see we did finally get that archers ring six hundred kills into the video off of a Dagon its supreme and the archers ring is the most valuable ring that you can get down here currently at a price of over five mil of course we did actually die right after we got the ring but that was just to bless our RNG for the next trip where we got our second archers ring so that was nice to see but yeah just a reminder you know if you're ever going to be doing Dagon if Kings always tried to prioritize protect from magic and the reason you want to prioritize protect for magic is because Prime's max hit with magic is a 50 and the attack speed is relatively fast so if your prayer isn't up in time you can get hit twice before you know it and most of the time you will die and if 50 is a pretty big hit to tank even with an elijan spirit shield and seeing us how tagging the supremes max hit is a 30 and Dagon effects is max it is a 26 you can kind of always assume that prime is the most dangerous of the three even though it has the worst drops of the three back on the subject of drops though just around 700 kills in to the video we did receive every single ring the last one being Berserker which is at a current price of 3.5 to 3.6 mil and we did actually get an archers ring in the very same inventory of that Berserker ring so felt pretty lucky for that one you know anytime you get multiple rings in one inventory it's definitely a good feeling because most of the time the price check for that inventory will always be over 10 mil if you get more than you know the right rings so it's always nice to see that and overall the price of these rings is pretty steady you know Sears ring is just at 450 K and it is dropped by prime warrior ring and Berserker ring are both dropped by rekhs and the archers ring is dropped by just supreme as well as getting all of these elite clew Scrolls as well as hard clues scrolls you know I always had something to do after I would bank and on average I would Bank just about every 100 to 130 kills per inventory which I wouldn't say is too bad while soloing especially off-task you know the elijan as well as the saying staff definitely did come in handy for soloing trips and what the elijan would do is essentially absorb any damage that I would be taking from all the small little minions that do guard this area all in the water I don't know how to pronounce their name I believe it's spinal or spin hope or something and also any time I did mess up my spawns or I didn't kill a Dagon if King fast enough and I would get double-teamed by either rex or supreme or supreme and prime flicking that elijah after every single hit would be really useful and i would tank a lot and therefore i would rarely ever die ear so that elijan really did come in handy and the reason that I brought the saying staff was because anytime that I would kill Rex I would usually freeze it just a few times and then the saying staff would kill it and all of the hits that I would use with the staff would actually replenish my HP almost too full every single kill so that would help me out a lot and if that wouldn't get the job done then I would use my saradomin god sword special attack on supreme and there you go essentially never needed food throughout all of these 3,000 kills all because of the gear that you bring so it is important to choose your gear wisely and your weapons wisely while killing decays you can always customize what you bring and what you use but it is all to extend your trip and be as efficient as you can so is something to keep in mind and the serpentine helmet was used because again I wasn't on Slayer tasks so there was no reason to use a slayer helmet for this video and was actually unable to get poisoned throughout this whole entire video because of that serpentine helmets although I did have to spend as some extras or scales just to ensure that I could have it equipped throughout the start to the finish but as the saying goes you have to spend money to make money and the proof is in the picture - Berserker rings as well as - archer rings and one inventory pretty sure this took less than 90 minutes to do this one individual trip and I made just over 17 million supplies you know blood runes and darts and zora scales potions and all this and all that you will always profit so just keep that in mind you know don't let all these supplies to motivate you and even if you have really bad luck as it pertains to getting any rings just keep in mind if you do have the elite Fremen ik diaries done which I did have before starting this video then every single time you kill a Dagon if King all of the bones from every single King will be noted and they are over 8,000 a GP each and you will also profit just by picking up the bones even if you get no rings and no rares and no clue Scrolls so yeah that's actually nice to know that you know no matter what you will profit but you do have to invest a lot of time into doing those diaries and just the side note about the inventory you know if you are maxed and you are soloing then it is recommended to bring in a beaut heart as well as to super combats to range pots and then the rest of your inventory should be super restores now if you are on Slayer tasks and you're not equipping a serpentine helmet which a lot of people are because most people do Dagon with Kings while they're on Slayer tasks unless you're like an Iron Man or something then I would recommend that you bring sand few serums instead of super restores essentially they act as a super restorer but they also cure poison and you do consistently get poisoned down here so that is something to keep in mind these Dagon of Kings also do drop food occasionally I believe you get some swordfish drops as well as some bass drops but not too often so you can't rely on the food but yeah with all that being said I hope that this was somewhat informative somewhat entertaining and quite a lot of drops to show you guys so first things first we are going to be opening all of the clue scrolled caskets those hard clues and those elite clues and then I will show you is a massive a jagganath king a drop tab 3000 kills one thousand rex supreme and prime and of course we did track all of the kills through the noted bones but also just to clarify we can check the ring a wealth boss log and see that we did actually kill 1000 r x prime and supreme the numbers speak for themselves averaging about eighty kills per hour this did take about forty hours to do just the PVM itself and then another five hours for all of these clue scrolls because I still don't use rune light so yeah not too bad a total of 23 hard caskets and five elite caskets wasn't really expecting too much I also made the decision not to do the master clues for this video mainly because you know I drag this one out for another week and I just really wanted to get this uploaded as soon as I could so I just didn't want to do any master clues I do apologize but something cool that we did pick up was an armadyl d hi children out of all of these hard caskets kind of a spoiler there but guys know this series pretty well by now you know these clue scrolls never really have paid off just yet I think to date the most impressive clue scroll reward from the solut series so far as it pertains to the hard clues has been a Robin Hood hat so yeah not any Third Age pieces yet no master clue pet either from any of the masters that we've done but I still have hope so I guess we'll see in the future if that changes and now we are left with the elite caskets 5 of these to open and you guys can probably assume what I get a whole lot of nothing but you know these elites one of these days like I said Third Age longsword it'll happen I really do believe that overall though even though our best item was that armadyl shield which was one point six mil I do believe we actually made anywhere from three to five mil from all these clues girls so I guess it was worth doing all of them I always know that you know clue scroll clips certainly never hurt a video and you know that is extra profit on top of whatever else you get so with that being said let's go ahead and move on to the Dagon of king loot 3,000 kills to price check the very first price check all of the ores the knives the arrows these are the drops that you really don't see too much of during the video but they certainly do add up over time five point seven mil that is certainly not too bad for just the basic normal drops that you can expect here you know those you logs definitely add up over time as well as the dragon axes and the second price check you know really just wanted to go for the basic armor that you get kind of low tier melee armor that these tagging of Kings drop as well as the 3,000 bones those come out to be just about twenty five point six mil so we go ahead we add the twenty five point six on to the five point seven and that leaves just one calculation one price check remaining all of the archer rings Berserker ring seers rings and warrior rings third and final price check you know if you're gonna get the most of one ring it is certainly good that it was archers for me the R&G was in our favor and ladies and gentlemen this price check the last one all the Rings do come out to be just about 79 0.9 mil so if we go ahead and we add up that seventy nine point nine mil to the thirty one point three mil from the two other previous price checks than the overall loot from three thousand tagging of Kings does come out to be one hundred and eleven point two mil and subtracting all of the supplies that we used all of the blood runes the sole risque 'ls the adamant darts the death runes the water runes and potions we can subtract just about twenty one mil in supplies so that leaves us with just about 90 mil profit from forty five hours of killing Dagon of Kings therefore over to Millett an hour and all of it was done off task no pet was achieved but we did get a lot of rings and I was really enjoying myself every single hour of this video so yeah I really do appreciate you guys watching with some new videos thank you again for watching and until next time Mista no sleep ow
