online store make it with Squarespace [Music] so 2018 is drawing to a close and this has just come in the post for me let's have a look inside when PA McKinnon got 200,000 subscribers he promised that 200,000 he'd punch himself in the face Sophie I should do the same at 200,000 subscribers I will also punch B McKinnon in the face I'm just kidding obviously I love Pierre he's one of my favorite youtubers so I just wanted to say really big thank you to all my subscribers because I really do appreciate you and I appreciate all your lovely comments and everything you leave and this is basically because you subscribe to my channel and thank you for that I decided to dedicate a lot more time this year to youtube videos and that involved taking a lot of time off a much better paying career I had and I want to go into my philosophy behind that a little bit and it makes me think a lot about career advice people get especially when you're younger coz my wife is a teacher and she teaches drama and a lot of her students really want to pursue drama they've got a real passion for it but they get dissuaded by well-meaning parents because their parents don't feel there are a lot of very safe career choices in that industry and they'd rather see them going to something where they're more guaranteed to get a job and one that will pay better 20-18 has been a really interesting year for me in terms of YouTube my channels gone from a couple of thousand subscribers to weigh over a hundred thousand and what is interesting about this is that that growth came when I stopped making the gear a few videos the videos that I thought people wanted and I started being a bit more true to myself and making videos that I really wanted to make which is more kind of essays on the arts and philosophy behind photography and that's when it kind of found its audience and it's not that there's anything inherently better about videos on the more theoretical side of photography / gear reviews the difference is that I was doing something that I was much more passionate about and this reminded me of a quote by Albert Schweitzer that I think he's relevant not just to YouTube but to anyone embarking on a career in a creative industry and the quote goes success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success basically you have to pursue what you love in life as long as you can survive on the money you making it doesn't really matter if you've got a job that earns you loads of money if you're going to spend every day doing something you hate and I'm not advocating at all to be reckless with your career choices as financial security is important I'm saying to find a subject that you're passionate about and throw yourself into that and when you do that you'll get good at it you'll put in more time more dedication because you want to and then it becomes a distinct possibility that you'll be able to use that to form a career of some kind and do what you love every day I was watching a video Jim Carrey giving a speech the other day and he was talking about his dad and how his dad could have been a stand-up comedian and he wanted to be but he didn't do it because he didn't think it was a safe career and so he chose to study accountancy and become an accountant but when Jim was age 12 his dad lost his job and the family struggled to make ends meet he took from this that if you can fail at doing something you don't want to do then you might as well take a chance on doing something you love so I'm just gonna carry on making the videos that I want to make videos on the theoretical side of photography there seems to be an audience for those and love making them so I'm going to carry on doing it expect lots more in New Year and you can never please everyone because well if you look at the comment section on my videos you'll understand why in fact um to get into festive mood let's read some of those comments [Music] so the comments I'm going to read are from my most popular video of this year which is why bad photographers think they're good first comment why bad YouTube's think they're good hmm while dude you sure know a lot about bad
