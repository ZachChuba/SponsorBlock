(Those were hard few days)
Whew, we almost thought our arms would fall out (Stretching fingers) We tried so hard to dig this out (The watermelon bowl got empty)
Ouch, this part right here I think I lost weight,
I think I lost weight Everyone at home adds different ingredients in, right? What did you put in your fruit punch? I put this - Yakurt
- Yes - Also, this
- Sprite? Of course These are must-haves Maybe my family was unique I didn't know most people add them I found out about it when I turned 20 We always put orange juice Wow But I found out later that it's not common There is already a lot of fruits in there But you are adding fruit juice to it so it may be strange Most people add yakurt, Milkis, or Sprite Since Seunghee suggested these ingredients, Seunghee should make it - however she wants
- Yay (Interesting) (Won't allow any mistake) - A measuring cup.. for making a fruit punch
- Of course, of course - Is it 1 to 1? Ma'am?
- What's the ratio? (Flustered)
Umm.. What's wrong with your voice? I'm an old master.. ehem 1 Sprite :1 Yakurt: 0.5 Milkis - 1:1:0.5
- Right She came up with it just now (No way)
No, I didn't Oh my, oh my, up to 600? (Old Master96's golden recipe)
Up to 600 This color though..? It looks like you just washed your face (Agreed) (Clean, clear, confident) Okay now we are done making the fruit punch - Seunghee, do you like it?
- Yes I love it It's Seunghee's recipe (How will Seunghee's fruit punch made
with precise measurements taste?) I've never had a fruit punch like this Is it good? (Very impressed by how good it is) Is it good? Really? Seunghee Can you tell us the ratio again? Sprite.. (Gulping) 1.5 (Few moments ago)
(1 Sprite) Yakurt.. Seunghee, you just made this, right? I keep forgetting it - Let's drink this fruit punch
- It's so good by the way Before they came here, they prepared some questions for me I don't know which of them asked which question yet I'll just pick and answer
some questions they have for me and ask, 'Whose question is this?' There's no prize for this,
but we'll determine the winner (I want to win)
Okay Q.What should you do to join Team IU? (Very nervous) Who wants to quit and come to Team IU? To get into our team... To get into our team... Personality is what's important If I happen to meet someone, the import important thing I'd look for
in that person is whether he's someone I'd get along well with That would make it easier
for us to work together for a long time Is it your question? Hyojung, personality is what's important (Feeling shy that she got caught) Give a tip for shooting a soju commercial Starting this year, the law has changed a little I'll tell you what not to do I don't tell this to just anyone - But I'll tell Oh My Girl
- Let's listen carefully Yes You were allowed to do this in a commercial before (Original soju commercial VER)
You'd drink like this Kyaa You can't do this anymore - You can't say 'kyaa'
- Why not? - Is it considered promoting drinking?
- No, it's not that.. - Is that true?
- That is true - It is?
- That's the idea Pretending to love it Drinking it as if it's good You can't act like you love it Let me tell you what to do instead Regarding this matter, - there were many discussions
- I see So you have to drink it, swallow it, and taste it When we eat something yummy and sweet, we salivate, so we have to go like this (Stimulating saliva VER) Oh this.. (Cracking up) (Human copy machine) Oh wait You posed exactly like I did (Perfect decalcomania) Q.A song by IU that will go well with Oh My Girl? That's the question I'm so curious It's 'Dlwlrma' (Shoulder dance)
I love that song It's a secret (This really is 'Dlwlrma') To anyone Wait, may be it won't go well - It doesn't go that well together
- It does I feel most embarrassed today I'm so sorry I've never said this to anyone before but I've written... lyrics which I wanted to give to Oh My Girl (No way, really?) That's the lyrics for 'Dlwlrma' She's lying She's lying - She really is lying
- Really, that song (Can't think)
Are they mad at me? Both of you? Did I make a mistake? Really? I love the lyrics for Dlwlrma Listening to it gives me courage A lot of the times, I write the lyrics first The lyrics may be full
of showing off and chop logic I always flew from in between the stars From there, I saw that the color of the sun was so cold It was not hot at all,
it was peacock blue I found you using a compass
braided with strands of breeze Like that The lyrics are a bit too fantastical for me to sing They are too unrealistic But I really wanted to write
something like that So I thought of someone else
who suits it better and that was Oh My Girl So I wrote the lyrics thinking that I want to give them to Oh My Girl
if I get a chance So for the lyrics, I even had a melody I wrote all that with Oh My Girl in mind (First release)
Now is the time instead (Too happy she fainted) It's you instead Now is that time instead,
now is the time, now is the time As I wrote the song itself I wished
that Oh My Girl would sing it and I finally got to talk about that here today (Where did it go? Who took our song?)
But what happened? Who took it? - Who took it? Who stole it?
- I'm sorry Q.I wish we could eat together,
what's your favorite food? (Nom nom nom)
Wow, this question - Who could have asked this? I think Seunghee did
- What? (No no)
You said you wanted to eat together Oh, it's Hyojung? (Hyojung's question asked with ulterior motives) But did you see the way she looked? She can't hide it They are both like cartoon characters (Very expressive like cartoon characters)
She went like this and that Hyojung, will you cook for me then? I could do that What are you best at making? Omurice I have to have.. at least two dishes for my meal Tteokbokki Tteokbokki and Omurice? These guys know what it's about (Know a lot about food) Rice and rice cakes They know what it's all about (An amazing combination) - I approve, I approve
- Okay then I'll come over sometime - Let three of us meet up again
- Sure Make me Omurice (Smiling widely)
and Tteokbokki I chose four of Hyojung's questions (No award but Hyojung won) Two questions - Thank you
- No wonder she's the leader - Who asked, "Whose your favorite Oh My Girl member?"
- I did I think she knows about TV shows and how to make it fun for the show Something a bit provocative and useful questions She knows since she has
a YouTube channel of her own - Should we do this?
- Which one? We are mutual fans of each other, right? - Mutual fans
- Right So let's see who compatible we are Let's find out about what we both like
and have in common I'm ready to do well on this For example, if I say 'Jjamppong vs jjajangmyeon', you have to pick one (Winter VS Summer) Summer - I think you answered a bit late
- No, I didn't Summer for me - Hyojung, Hyojung
- I like swimming - I get that you are good with TV shows
- We get it - We get it
- I really do like summer - If you go too far, it will get too obvious
- It's so unfair You almost went too far just now No, I didn't even look sideways Rewind and see if my eyeballs were rolling (Video assistant referee) Summer - Summer
- Winter Winter (Plot twist as good as that of The Sixth Sense)
I like swimming I get that you are good with TV shows (Method acting)
We get it (Soju VS beer) Soju Oh my goodness Beer makes me too full The same goes for me (Chicken VS pizza) - Chicken
- Pizza (Ah.. Chicken..) You should have looked for a hint this time She was more confident than ever this time Pizza I was so confident just now (Super confident) (Dance VS ballad) Dance - I thought we would disagree on this
- I'm a dancer/singer (King of dance) She got confident (Strawberry VS watermelon) - Strawberry
- Watermelon (Sneak peeking)
From this - We like the same things
- We are the same (Super jealous)
How could this happen? (Pow pow) I see (Lee Jieun VS dlwlrma) I can be confident with this one One, two, three - Lee Jieun
- dlwlrma Dlwlrma I'm the only one who said dlwlrma? This is so unexpected Why do we like so many of the same things? It must be true that similar people (It's a success)
like each other Think of me as an unofficial member
of Oh My Girl Think of me as a hidden member We are so compatible,
we should team up (Super welcome) So today, us three who are so compatible
did a show together For the last part, let me check if you really had a good time here - Let me check with a lie detector
- Okay Come on in, come on in So finally, we will do a lie detector test If they lie..? (Flinching) You can leave without saying bye That's too mean Also, that's wrong Guys, all you need to do is not lie - But that machine may be wrong
- We didn't even get started and think they are going to lie Let me go first Okay, Seunghee will go first Let's make this hurt Let's make it painful if she lies Being on IU's Homebody Signal was so fun it was worth coming
here on my day off It was fun - It was fun?
- It was fun So fun it was worth coming
on a day off (The nerve-wrecking moment) I really was being honest (Honest)
Oh (Got even happier) I survived Why are you sweating so much? (Umm ehem) - You saw that, right?
- Yes - Don't lie
- True (They've never used this machine before)
Should I press it one more time? Wait, this is weird Just do it right away? When you discovered
you had to come here today, you felt sad that you couldn't get
to go home a day earlier Not sad - She said she didn't feel sad about it
- I really didn't at all I really didn't Ouch (Feeling dizzy)
Okay, Hyojung, get up and get out, get out No, no, this is wrong This didn't check me It checked her and shocked me (VAR) - Sad
- Not sad Should we push this button again? (This is not the right button) (Machine didn't work properly)
(and shocked Hyojung..) (The staff knew all this but didn't tell them)
Why did you do that? Why didn't you tell us? (Mean) Hyojung got super flustered (Argh, argh) She may punch you Let's say she was truthful Finally, to Homebody Signal viewers, say bye as Oh My Girl members This felt like I got prepared
for summer with IU here I hope many people watching
this would do what we did here Make a fruit punch for yourself I really felt so relaxed while I spent my time here This is the studio I've been
watching on my phone I'm so glad to be in here sitting and talking together like this I got to brag about my favorite slippers, - made a fruit punch, and
- Bragged about the homemade wine bragged about the homemade wine So I had a very very fun time here Okay then We'll be back with more fun ideas Dlwlrma feels happy with you, See you in the EDAM future Bye (After the filming session..) (Q.A surprise question) (Were you happy filming with Oh My Girl?)
Very happy It felt as good as going to a concert of a singer I like (Did IU say the truth?) (Super nervous) Ouch Oh my goodness (Without a bye, camera turns OFF)
What's wrong with this? Oh my goodness - It's wrong, it's wrong
- Cut
