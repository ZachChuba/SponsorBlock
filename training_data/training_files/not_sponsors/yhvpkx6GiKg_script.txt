so now this is an interesting story to say the least a story of revenge luck and the lack thereof a story with a defense and an attack the whole shebang not only crammed into one video but crammed into one day wipe day on the most popular server in rust rustified main now pay attention because this story takes off quick as these five heads right here are about to come and rate us now we're making history today boys because i ain't gonna start this video on the [ __ ] beach as a goddamn naked all right we're gonna start this video in the middle of the map with some bows archie and i we're about to set up our first base you just destroyed that man oh they had enough yeah and a tc nice all right let's set everything you killed them both yeah all right let's set it right down here where they were about to build we had no real plans for this server we just wanted to get a base down as soon as possible because it wasn't for swipe so people did have blueprints just to get you guys a little bit more updated with where we were building this is where we were located in the center of the map in between all the monuments and we just so happened to overlook the small 2x2 that was right behind our base nice i'm gonna demolish again go up huh oh [ __ ] they broke both goddamn yeah whatever [ __ ] them kid [ __ ] them kids man and before you could get ready yeah i've been pissed off wrong people already wonder what they're going to find up there of lots of rockets maybe okay uh i'm not too proud of this moment so i'm just gonna yeah good luck hey holy [ __ ] you're all the same man you're all the same all americans are the same person now i don't think the guys outside took too kindly to me beating them in a yelling contest because they came over shortly after three two

good we can't technically see i'm clearing all right we should maybe dip dude and go get farm yeah right now you want to just go [ __ ] it let's go let's go let's go let's go oh i think they live right behind us we took the moment they ran back to their base as an opportunity to quickly get more supplies so we could fortify a little bit more in case they came to raid us a big group like that always has plans to expand on wipe day and they would definitely want to get us out of the area boom let's go boom crafting it's gonna need to be key locked still but whatever oh here they come oh do we want to open oh oh my god we could start the door move your bag now moving hmm what do we want to put we can't break this anymore one [ __ ] diet we have a lot of time so i can lather it now though yeah could just put a door door on cc yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna shoot right when it breaks okay here we go we can go up on the roof lock and break the top if you want and just fight from the top like secure it's like secure this room yeah we can break it you want to go yeah all right we just fight from here should i put up stairs should i put stairs ready three two one oh they just went away do

didn't even hit me nice nice nice grabbed it i grabbed it all right nice we just [ __ ] defended nice oh my goodness gracious dude oh it's one close one that was a close one but that was all we needed to do was get that sheet metal door on our front door because they wouldn't be saturating this early into the wipe at least we thought yeah we got enough to finish this head was only one of the five members who lived behind our base it was time to get some more hit him one dead headshot nice my bad nick i'm pretty sure green car's still here oh [ __ ] right in front of us in front of us hazmats too headshot one showing no [ __ ] ammo what a joke i'm left on that one you can't loot him for ammo one's pushing for that one's pushing for left oh my god they're so loaded dude hit him down one down last one's like northeast yeah he's leaving he's leaving okay we should loot that's fine you're gonna be able to grab a thing give me that no he's got a water bottle nail gun on the ground if you want oh to didn't finish you no way all right we're going [ __ ] it i have a tsar on a med all right you're out let's leave that was more than a close call but we did make it out with a sar and a med stick for researching we spent all the resources we gathered upgrading our base and then we headed to sats and that's when we encountered another large group on rustified main they're landing they're landing oh my god they all just show it's like five guys go go go 210. yeah i'm coming right here good spot in the sofa oh one's coming late right kill him heads jesus four running past us one we jumped and two more were behind them jesus that was a good play but we did not expect that many [ __ ] people so with every successful wipe day there's a few unsuccessful moments and this just so happened to be the start of our streak oh i got double bow that's three guys behind one king's so shipping guys i'm done shotgun oh grind i'm dead they're getting bowed out now yeah it's all dead [ __ ] insane work hit archie other guy oh i'm hit i shot him headshot i mentioned nice he's dead but there's one more one more behind the thing oh one below us as well still oh my god i'm three health hit him all right you want to try to make a move i got 98 health head joints oh my god it's awesome two tommy's jesus we just lost it all it was four of a man there's a fire going on up there dude and just as fast as our luck diminished we began to get it all back what the [ __ ] i can't see because the god rage dude one dead one then there's another one oh get jump shot [ __ ] oh my god they're mad yeah holy yeah there was three of them they were all loaded we grabbed what we could and we ran home with the loot oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] [ __ ] up what are they doing here oh what the [ __ ] that's going on left too man attacking you ain't gonna want to fight just keep tagging them all light them up a little bit of [ __ ] back not the scrap that i wish we had from the first [ __ ] time but definitely a lot of stuff that was definitely a little bit back after what we had lost at the junkyard fight but we decided to head back to junkyard once again to see if beetlejuice or amar were anywhere around now to start off this incident we'll be going into the eyes of archie this time tagged in pool dodge dead there's two guys to our right as well please not kill me man hey buddy where you at come here i'm not gonna kill you come here come here come here don't shoot don't shoot do not shoot come here come here come here come here don't shoot me he's not killing me man hello hello no way that just happened no way they're that dumb came from the road oh my dead oh my god it's like three dude i just got [ __ ] double crossing i'm hit again like what the how are we getting jumped right now at our friends oh my god i'm dead i just he just missed a compound bush on me come back come back come back kill them all but i have zero ammo no is that a revolver no i'm done that was not how that run home was supposed to go and what's worse than losing all that loot the fact that it was to our neighbors i can't believe we just freaking lost that dude to our neighbors it's our neighbors so why are they sitting there waiting for us like that no i did that freak i'm not gonna let them leave their [ __ ] base then i'm not letting them leave their [ __ ] base i'll sit out there for the next two hours i don't give a [ __ ] and so i did i'm not proud of it either but sometimes you just need to blow off some steam i mean they didn't have to risk anything for those guns that they got from us so i didn't want to risk anything to try to get them back so he's dead i'd say i sat outside their base a little bit longer than i needed to but i did have fun and even though we didn't get any guns i'd say i'd blown off enough steam all right you wanna go home let's go that was the night and rust where archie finally decided it was time for him to get off as it was already four in the morning in the uk so i would need to find a plan on how i was going to survive on this server alone it it gave me comfort while i crafted because uh i needed a bag in wall-e i've i'm not gonna [ __ ] play solo on maine what do you think i am stupid i took a two-hour break while i waited for wally to get on and then when we did both get on i went to go check to see if our neighbors had expanded we're in a really good spot i'm curious to see how much these guys behind us expanded it seemed like they hadn't expanded much but they were gonna try to build what looked to be a 3x3 even closer to our base there's a full twig base right outside ours my only regret was not using this moment while they were gone to destroy their tc yeah team it was actually very strange that they weren't anywhere to be found their base hadn't grown and this random twig 3x3 had just appeared out of nowhere but why weren't they here upgrading it wally was having some internet issues when he first joined so i made a quick run to bandit camp and on my way back home we finally encountered our neighbors again oh two the base the bit twig base two full people on the base on that twig one right here why are they gonna upgrade it hit one full cockpit compound bow he's tweaking he's tweaking it oh my god wait it's damn yeah yeah yeah i'm dead i'm dead again [ __ ] 230 seconds they're just sitting on there dude what was his name metro oh my god it is our neighbors yeah it's our neighbors they got [ __ ] guns and [ __ ] they might make that their main it looks like yeah that's exactly what it looks like why i know we know exactly where tc is so our neighbors now had our guns had full road sign we're calling in an air drop and we're planning on building a 3x3 honeycomb right outside our base while we were left inside our base with some [ __ ] double barrels i mean at this point it just seemed like territory warfare and i didn't like how confident this group was getting one bit around our base this was my land i would just need the proper weapon to be able to take these guys all out i took a db and i went out in the middle of the night to door camp a random base hoping it would give me the weapon i needed hey yeah that's not very nice that was much more than i could have asked for i grabbed what i could and i headed back home to base this would turn the tables on our neighbors like no other as a matter of fact i'd say that this turned the tables on the server for good for the rest of the wipe i made a play dude on them no not on them i didn't expect them to have this though look what i got top right oh what that's not what i was expecting but okay now we go and we kill these [ __ ] man that inside the door no they're both dead they're both dead i'm crashing up come on man really using suppressor ak man funny thing is this red car that we got off of killing them for the first time when they were geared was the beginning of the end for our neighbors we never had plans of running launch but with this red card now we did yo there's another one killed this guy well i killed python yeah okay he's on top of the one across oh i see him i see him i can start tapping at him you see him he's up there though yeah i hit him three times in the legs you could jump up on your ladder probably he's hiding oh i'm dead dude i like this peak half a second got beamed okay that kind of sucks yeah i'm coming back i honestly didn't care to stick around and fight this guy in the dark alone so i grabbed what i could and i headed back towards base on the way back home to wally we ran into even more trouble oh i'm dead dude what'd they have solar kid i hit him with a slug i have a ricky wait isn't that them no i don't think so they're messed yeah i got 100 i got 180 seconds they live right next to us those kids who just killed me uh are they in this two by two with honeycombing starting around it yeah there's like two bases though i hear them outside i hear them out there yeah one's housing they're upgrading something got a guy running down to him right now with a sword in his hand as well there's three i might drop them right here i think i have to one's dead but double headshot two i need to loot this one by the space ak [ __ ] man eight bullets in a dream baby and in case you're wondering what happened to wally he died so my [ __ ] god i wish you wouldn't [ __ ] ditch dude yeah i got it all back what so back to what we were talking about about the red card being the end of our neighbors yeah well it was this launch run that was the beginning of the end for our neighbors oh my wally what 2c4 no you didn't no [ __ ] words we could raid them bro we could break from the roof yeah we can what i was expecting and kind of hoping to be a battle that would last days into the wipe just got the opportunity to be ended tonight we hadn't heard from or seen our neighbors in the past hour or two and we assumed they had gotten off for the night and we were about to as well but now we couldn't go to sleep and miss this opportunity on what could possibly be a loaded two by two all right you ready you wanna just go hit it hello uc4 let's grab letting flying hammer wood stone just in case we need a seal so this is also there's that garage but we don't want to right through that garage right no no we do not probably literally has like a hundred stone with this okay corner yeah yeah people make sure it's so weird though man you never know like they they could have like had it like the wrap around like door door and then like tc here like but so is this a little frame is this a door frame right here okay that looks like a door frame oh it is a wrap around oh that is a door frame so so it's right here i think remains right here i think they have two main like this is they might have like a two batteries here that's what i'm feeling i don't know so i'm gonna hit this on the there's like mine it's like oh my god it's all they're all in here what the [ __ ] oh my arm okay we got it we gotta grab and go dude face mask oh my god dude we actually just [ __ ] did it dude if their tc is going to be loaded we should we need to somehow [ __ ] get a [ __ ] dc dude we need to sound like a tc their base had exactly what we expected completely loaded with loot waiting for the next day of white it's five guys bro i know dude like they were they were loaded dude i gotta get in i got like two rows of guns right now all this loot on wipe day on top of everything we already had would be huge for us for the rest of the week and now we just need to find an explosive to tap into their tc room quick so why not go back to the spot where we found our first two c4 you get anything up there nope now i'll be honest wally didn't bring too much to the table today on wipe day but i'd be lying if i said that this kid didn't bring me some sort of good luck that would have been so [ __ ] perfect and now we're like pushing [ __ ] 6am right now like god could just find it man oh my god we gotta go we gotta go oh my god legit we got it we gotta be again dude oh my god you would not believe how i just got this bacon we gotta go we gotta go holy [ __ ] we ran back as fast as we could researched and ran straight back to their base to blow the last door my god the high quality crap build bill billboard yeah so wow all right metro to think that he was so close to preventing all of this at the start of the wipe what's crazy to me is that this whole story of revenge can often take the whole wipe but it happened all on wipe day we returned to our base for good that night and would log off and sleep well knowing that these five enemies were no longer a threat in our area we are coming up quick on 600k subs remember i'm doing a custom secret labs rush chair giveaway on my twitter so go follow my socials if you want to participate and if you guys celebrate thanksgiving then i hope you have a good one you
