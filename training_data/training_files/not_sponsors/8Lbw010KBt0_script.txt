gonna go eat that thing so watch the video here's my mission statement with this video monster layers are as cool as confetti cake when you're 6 and we're not allowed to use them enough ok let's actually get started so there are these types of monsters that are a little stronger than others that get this super exclusive title of legendary legendary monsters can suck my butt gas in their defense I think legendary actions are an amazing tool when fighting a big ass party because they don't get body-slammed by turning kana me but they're restricted to either high level monsters or unicorns that and legendary resistance are my two gripes they have a proprietary ability that you can't use anywhere else and they disable spellcasters and probably the least fun way just imagine like alright I'm gonna try and banish that dragon this is my last spell slot and we need just a few rounds to recover from that he uses his legendary resistance and you Auto fail oh okay I'll just I'll just go [ __ ] myself yeah please do and they're the only beefcakes who are allowed actually cool layers I uh I think a lot more monsters should have active layers let's look at some existing ones to get inspired then I'll roll on some random table I come up with for a couple monsters and try to give them layers we'll start with B holders they take the most time to make their domain perfect but their alien nature passively warps it around that's so [ __ ] cool generally they pick isolated locations like underground caves the sea temples in Minecraft and volcanoes now most magical layers have regional effects which are all amazing for narrative DMS for B holders people get scopa Stasia or they always feel like somebody's watching them but when the beholder is sleeping everything within a mile radius just gets weird paintings and statues start to warp slime coats random [ __ ] trinkets and goods appear and disappear just awesome stuff that can start an investigation but the exclusive content in legendary layers are layer actions this is going to be the focal point when we make our own layers these actions are dangerous little events that occur once per round at initiative 20 they can be invoked intentionally or passively or even by some residents servants running through the walls for B holders like most creatures they get 3 variants the first Nickelodeon slime soaks into the floor and makes moving around hard for everyone but the beholder for the second just like in a damn horror film acid trip arms just jut out of the walls and start to grab people and the third a big-ass I shows up on any surface and stares someone down with a bonus array if you think random weird magic [ __ ] shooting out of the wall during a fight doesn't make for an amazing combat you can kindly commit heart not move but if you want a more evil and ominous layer consider black dragons they chill in nasty-ass swamps exclusively but their aura effects makes the swamp so much more disgusting and ominous I love it not just one mile but a six mile radius around the lair is difficult terrain due to several factors thick spiny overgrowth twisted thorns deep swamp water that smells like dick cheese and a thin layer of fog if you're near the lair and you drink the water for some reason you get GERD faster than you can crap out a Chicken McNugget but when you reach the field of pickled bodies and find that dragon the lair can do any of the following area events the stinky poopoo water reaches out and literally grabs people a massive swarm of mosquitoes shows up and shreds your skin like razors unnatural darkness consumes you before the Dragon does the same with a sneak attack latent magic is incredibly awesome and I get why legendary creatures have the environment itself help them but I think we can be a bit more creative and apply this stuff to just about anything I'm gonna waste some time counting and picking anything between CR 1 through 4 for something in the official books and run through D&D beyond ok so I got an Acer and a Hippogriff this was a horrible idea okay so a zr half construct half elemental mockeries of dwarves who hate the big red oni men their environment actually gives us some stuff to work with as they all dwell in the elemental plane of earth fire or the fountains of creation we don't get inherent regional effects but the terrain itself is interesting enough within at least a mile of a Naser outpost the following things might stand out a lack of other malicious natives or potentially even corpses of salamanders that were slain during skirmishes sudden uniform caves with unnatural lava flow or a distinct lack of gemstones and lastly closer by you might find a system of mine carts and rails in the center of all this you find the outpost a large area with solid defences and immaculate forges let's think up a few things this layer might do when you're storming the outpost as beings of living fire will allow them some local attunement so firstly we'll have lava geysers they could either go off unprovoked or commanded by the resident general may be brewing inside a forge could be an unborn a sir that can be brought to life as a one-time-use slayer action or to throw in a third option considering their artisanal reputation some brass contraptions might fire flaming arrows with a command word a pressure plate or even on a timer every I don't know one D four rounds there we have a unique encounter with a mixed bag of events that isn't just Wack Wack Wack death hippogriffs gonna be a bit harder as their mindless and weak as heck I basically have to give a horse layer actions they reside in grasslands or mountains so we'll put them in a Rocky Hill Zone the surrounding area might hint at their nature with things like the blood splatters of drop animals or large patches of heavyset hoofs and claw prints with no trails leading to or from them and that that's it it's a damn horse eagle what do you want from me at the lair itself a place you actually don't really want to be you'll find a huge nest made from bones and dry vegetation with live born young to protect a Hippogriff is more dangerous here than anywhere else eh they mate for life so I'd allow a one time layer action for maybe a second Hippogriff to show up a couple other options would maybe be something like rockslides which risks steep falls from the party and even dead falls if you land below one or you could also consider action searches when someone gets within 5 feet of one of the young that's pretty much all I got I'd love to see some more ideas in the comments my conclusion here is that adding some local complications during any combat is a hell of a lot cooler than simply fighting to the death using math goodbye you you
