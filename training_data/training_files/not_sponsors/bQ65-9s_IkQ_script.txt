chances are that you enrolled in talarian community college for the opportunity to study under one of our great tutors if you were enrolled in my class then i can only apologize maybe next year you'll have better luck tutors are a great way to improve your odds for success and used in the right way can help your decks perform way more consistently they're at the heart of many combos and strategies and in some formats they even go out of their way to grab cards out of the sideboard in order to adapt to situations while also keeping their wind conditions safe from hand disruption there's another way to tutor that you may not know about if you picked up magic the gathering more recently though and that is transmute transmute is a key worded ability that was introduced back in 2005 with ravnica city of guilds the mechanic for the dimir guild it featured on 13 cards transmute allows you to pay a cost and discard the card with transmute from your hand in order to search your library for a card of the same converted mana cost as the card you discarded so far the cost to transmute has been 3 mana you can only transmute at sorcery speed so it's not quite as useful as cycling as you'll not be able to hold up mana to transmute during an opponent's turn much like cycling though you're not actually casting a spell so in order for an opponent to counter this ability they would need a niche effect like void made husher or disallow that's able to counter an activated ability either way if someone does elect to transmute it's usually better to hold that counter for whatever is tutored up the main exceptions to this are if you expect an opponent to be able to recur that card easily if the spell is likely to have split second or if the spell is likely to have storm transmute is a pretty strong ability all said and done so how's it best used well speaking of storm let's go back in time a little one of the many benefits of the talarian community college is access to totally safe and in no way dangerous time rifts brian gates qualified for the 2006 pro tour in honolulu by playing a blue green storm combo deck to win at an extended format pro tour qualifier the goal of the deck was to use a combination of heartbeat of spring and early harvest to generate enough mana to cast a succession of cheap spells the storm count generated by this line of play would culminate in a lethal brain freeze milling out an opponent heartbeat of spring also saw play at pro tour honolulu itself piloted to a top eight finish for maximilian bract this iteration was a standard deck and it utilized that same mana generation strategy to cast a big x spell to finish the game this particular deck also ran drift of phantasms a transmute card that could go and grab the key pieces of the deck this card functioned well as an early game blocker against aggro decks and a tutor to find what was needed it's this versatility that makes transmute such an exciting ability and the best of the transmute cards are the ones that offer the strongest effects that you'd like to be playing anyway of the transmute cards a few in particular stand out for commander play talaria west while a substandard university they think they're so great just because they're accredited is a great way to turn late game land drops into value plays by digging for a utility land like cabal coffers urborg tomb of yagmoth or strip mine don't forget that it can also grab zero cost cards muddle the mixture as a counter spell when you need it or a tutor when you don't and there are more than enough two mana spells you can grab in commander that you won't be short of targets but there's one transmute card that i'd like to highlight in particular today as i think it deserves to see more commander play that card is demure house guard demure house guard is a 2-3 skeleton for three in a black it has fear an evasion ability that allows only black or artifact creatures to block it you can also sacrifice a creature in order to regenerate the house guard if you've not played with or against many aristocrat style decks before it might seem an unassuming little card what makes it good though is the fact you have a free sacrifice outlet and a tutor rolled into one card aristocrats is an archetype that many players love and in commander free sacrifice outlets are the preferred option in most cases whether it's an astronaut's altar for generating mana altar of dementia to mill or self-mill or goblin bombardment to do damage straight to the face not having to pay mana to sacrifice permanence is the goal all aristocrats decks aim for but ultimately they're looking to capitalize on what happens when the creatures die enchantments like dictate of arabos and grave pact and the creature equivalent butcher of malakir all trigger when creatures die being able to hold up the ability to sacrifice a creature for free is an incredible advantage when it comes to negotiating your way through a multiple player game they aren't the only effects worth triggering though whether you're looking at drawing cards through mulder vine reclamation or grim horror specs draining or gaining life with blood artists and zulliport cutthroat or making treasure with a pitiless plunderer there are countless ways to benefit from creatures dying now of course dimir house guard isn't the best tudor it costs three at sorcery speed and it's also restricted to grabbing spells that cost four mana thanks to being a transmute card judging purely on those metrics it's worse than grim tutor demonic tudor and vampiric tudor what it has over those powerful cards though is flexibility in the right deck this is two cards in one it's also far more easily recurred to be used again being a creature rather than an instant or sorcery and it doesn't hurt that instead of paying fifteen dollars thirty five dollars or ninety dollars you can grab a copy of demure house guard for 50 cents that's affordable for everyone there is that one drawback though only spells that cost 4 mana how many good 4 mana spells can there be well actually quite a few given you'll be wanting to run demure houseguard in a deck all about sacrificing creatures for value let's start there birthing pod one of the premier ways to access the creatures you need to answer or further any board state you'll come across just so happens to be 4 mana this artifact is an extremely popular card in these styles of deck and can help you access your combo or utility creature if you're short on time and need to pull out an eldrazi now then consider grabbing pattern of rebirth it allows you to tutor any creature in your deck into play for free when the creature pattern of rebirth is attached to dies which if you're playing aristocrats shouldn't be too much trouble the aforementioned grave pact can also be fetched with transmute as can falconrath noble and vindictive vampire two common pieces of the aristocrats death by 1000 cuts engine for mana production there's pitiless plunderer a way to convert all of your death triggers into treasure or sifter of skulls who can make eldrazi scions when your creatures die instead if you're stuck on lands there's always sad robot though if you're in green why not grab sky shroud claim instead if you're in white this is a great way to grab smothering tithe a card the rest of your pod is sure to be quote unquote happy about seeing for card draw greater good is the premier target as it's a sacrifice outlet that can also filter you through large amounts of cards the necessity to discard three cards each time may seem like a downside but with the right reanimation effects you'll be happy to fill your yard a well-timed living death can really capitalize on this line of play you can also grab smothering abomination or guardian project arabos god of the dead or even gaunty lord of luxury one of the better cards to search out if your creatures end up on the larger side like grave titan is disciple of bolas for tokens if your commander isn't elenda the dusk rose then digging her out of the deck if you can feel a board wipe coming isn't the worst plan if you simply want to make more tokens then anointed procession and parallel lives are both available at 4 mana 2. if elenda is your commander you can use demir house guard to go grab tasa karlov and vice versa this strategy is also applicable to a deck with marine of clan nell toth at the head you could use the transmute to dig out jared golgari lich or the other half of the combo bone horde if you're concerned with getting things back from your graveyard and are wary that regrowth and eternal witness aren't for mana then fear not golgari find broker and acolyte of affliction are both available at four and luminous brood moth is a great way to ensure your creatures come back for free the first time they fall for removal there's plenty at this mana cost but our end is one of the most versatile but sometimes grabbing ravenous chupacabra is the best way to get some recurable removal into play four mana wraths are also an option with damnation and wrath of god being amongst the best options on offer you could even grab snuff out on turn 3 and still have a way to play it for free if you're apprehensive about an opponent getting their commander out early heck if you played your commander i lea eternal pilgrim on turn 2 you could go grab deadly rolla can play that for free along those lines force of vigor is another quote-unquote free spell that nullifies some of the tempo loss from tutoring by being able to be cast for free during an opponent's turn and if graveyards are an issue agent of airbus can solve it if you're in an aristocrat style deck chances are you'll have extra enchantments to re-trigger it in the future heck if you're ready for the game to be over you could do worse than tutoring up triumph of the hordes suddenly all of your utility creatures look a lot more threatening don't they if you're also in blue because you're playing kel's fight fixer you can grab glen elendra archmage summary dismissal cryptic command or even or a thief i mean you could also grab notion thief but we're friends right you wouldn't do a dirty move like that would you if you're also in red piloting a deck like judith the scourge diva or alesha who smiles at death access to murderous red cap sling gang lieutenant and perforos god of the forge is honestly pretty exciting too the beauty of demure houseguard is that it's so so easy to reuse as a creature there are countless ways to bring it back to your hand to use again and if you do have it in play and someone tries to exile it well just activate the regenerate ability by sacrificing the demure house guard while it won't regenerate itself as it won't be there it'll still escape the removal and end up in your graveyard instead of an exile nice trick in a format that many believe is suffering from power creep it'd be all too easy to just fill your deck with the most expensive and versatile tutors and at some tables hey maybe that's what's needed or what everyone wants to do for many commander players though they're seeking ways to keep games interesting and less linear demere house guard is a budget tutor that can fulfill those goals it's only as powerful as the cards you include that cost exactly four mana if you're looking to hit that sweet spot between consistent but not overly oppressive give this little guy a go he's cheap and well he's not cheerful but he will make you cheerful and in the end that makes me cheerful looking to add you
