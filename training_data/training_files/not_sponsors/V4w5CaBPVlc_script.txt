[Music] The Legend of Zelda breath of the wild changed the world when it first released in 2017 this game pushed the boundaries of what we expected in an open-world game to put it simply this game is phenomenal and many would agree thousands of gamers dumped hundreds of hours into this game myself included besides an adventure of a lifetime and an unforgettable experience what did we gain from it anyone who played this masterpiece definitely learned some life skills what if we were to use these life skills in the real world specifically using them to apply to jobs well I'm going to apply to jobs using breath of the wild as experience before getting raid Shadow legends you won't regret it I certainly don't to begin our job hunt we need an identity I created Brett Wilde he lives on 17 Acala Road in Kakariko Hawaii 96 738 his email is Brett of the wild at gmail.com and I set up a Google Voice account for our phone number with a special voice mail now that Brett Wilde is a living person on the internet I put together a very scattered resume and began by listing some skills cooking climbing courageous resourceful leadership and collaborative as for job experience I gathered a lot of random jobs link took on during his question breath of the wild I began with quality assurance tech at hat no ancient tech lab there he tested in operated explosives and hazardous materials he led troubleshooting of specific sensor equipment for tablets increased the amount of ice blocks created from water at a time and improved temporary time manipulation by several seconds the next is architect for Tarrytown which describes the biggest SciQuest line creating Tarrytown he picked a perfect spot of land to build a bustling town gathered required materials to construct homes and facilities recruited skilled carpenters to create my dream vision of Tarrytown and brought together a diverse and thriving community then I added environment waste cleanup for head soup based on the core exceeds recovered nearly 1,000 pieces of waste around the world donated recyclable waste to local musicians for environment friendly insurance fixed in rearranged greenery while gathering recyclable material and traveled long distances in record time to acquire waste and because breath of the wild introduced the greatest mechanic cooking I had to put it in here chef's assistant which was based on Coco's kitchen sigh question gathered specific ingredients for chef Coco in a timely manner assisted in feeding a family delicious food helped prepare delectable dishes with chef Coco and attacked a beehive to retrieve tasty honey and finally I added electrician for various shrines and towers restored controllable electricity in 100 shrines around the world reconnected entire networks through towers maneuvered through motion-based challenges and discovered shortcuts for more efficient power restoration citing some people's ridiculous tactics in shrines this resume is incredibly scattered I decided to focus on two from my job experience quality assurance and electrician I proceeded to make two cover letters to apply to jobs with this is the one I made for electrician I stumbled upon electrician work while saving the world in my time as an electrician I restored energy to over 100 shrines I faced challenges that tested my will and strength with successful results the more difficult tasks even required specific motions shrines were not the only success in my career I reconnected multiple towers that allow geographical information to pass in controlled areas these were instrumental in the creation of a network across the world beyond the shrines and towers I also stealthily retrieved items charged with electricity to use in my quests I am eager for new challenges with my courage power and wisdom I am sure to take on any task you throw at me and then here's the cover letter I made for Quality Assurance previously I was employed at the hata no ancient tech where I led Quality Assurance on groundbreaking tablet technology that will modernize the way we interact with the world while there the company leap Turtles and increase the quality of their cutting-edge software communication and collaboration is key in Quality Assurance and those are my strongest assets during my time at Hot know I was privileged enough to travel around the world I encountered dozens of different kinds of wonderful people from varied backgrounds many of these individuals helped me determine the strengths and weaknesses of the technology I possessed Pat knows inevitable success won't be because of just me but the collaborative efforts of all of us and finally I wanted to make one more cover letter so I decide to make a generic cover letter to use when applying to urgently hiring jobs since that's what link does in breadth of the wild always helping those who urge indeed help your job listing is marked as urgently hiring so I am inclined to assist you my peers have dubbed me a hero of legend because of my unrelenting desire to help others in my time I have completed over 70 errands for people quite literally all over the world these errands I have done both paid and volunteer required a range of skills and abilities I have worked in Quality Assurance ill to town and acted as an assistant to a chef it is safe to say that I am up for any challenge for as long as you will have me with these three cover letters I went to indeed calm and applied for 64 different kinds of jobs and this is what happened the responses coming in were slow it doesn't help that I was applying on a holiday weekend in the United States but I did get a few responses the first email I received was for one of the urgently hiring postings a retail sales associate position and of course they wanted to interview the almighty hero of legend in Brent Wilde they even confirmed that they looked over his messy resume that's great we are got one interview the next response I received was for another urgently hiring position for public relations in social media in Turkey they also wanted to interview Brett Wilde so that's really cool that cover letter just must have been really good or you know it's because they're urgently hiring I'm gonna go with the cover letter though give me more props now this is where the fun begins the third response was from a video game company in California I had applied to a quality assurance or QA lead there they emailed me a test and in this test I had to create a test plan assignment for a game I created they whined a five-level game that's 2d and named Brett wilds fake adventure and asked to put it in a spreadsheet application for them I decided to go above and beyond and I even created art for my game titled Brett of the wild and then I went to Google sheets and created my test plan unfortunately Google wasn't cooperating that night so I had to take a screenshot and I sent them that instead I thought it was okay but they never responded later I received an email for one of the electrician positions this is what they said your skill set is impressive maybe too impressive we think your talents may be better suited for saving Hyrule instead of working here thanks for the laughs smiley face Rebecca oh thank you Rebecca finally someone recognized the joke I'm glad I could make you laugh Rebecca after that I received only two more emails a generic rejection letter for a QA job and then one very interesting one regarding and urgently hiring receptionist position hi Brett your resume is spectacular and we'd love to interview you please come by Kakariko village on Thursday the 20th at 10:30 a.m. and ask for Impa see you then Hiro this one got me usually the best response we got in this entire video I'm so glad they understood and went so far that they mentioned EMPA not every Zelda fan knows EMPA it's pretty impressive at the end of the day we got a few interviews and got some people to laugh only one traditional rejection email this is a win for our hero of the wild don't ever let someone say that your love for Zelda isn't worthwhile in the real world Brett Wilde has just proved otherwise Thank You hero [Music] [Applause] [Music]
