this video features an encounter with the same clan we were fighting in my previous mini-series this group is highly toxic yet they pretended they weren't sometimes to make themselves look good when they found out it was me fighting them in my last series they specifically targeted me that Mike's family outside my base seeking clothes or being racist and homophobic and our other interactions with them now I'm not trying to complain I just want to show you guys our reactions to it trolling people in rust is part of my resume Casey Mel is my mentor in rust and I learned a lot from him while we exposed toxicity by trolling people in the past now I'm not a threat in-game unless you're a threat to me or overly toxic I know I have the ability to reason and be compassionate with groups and rust the cleanse who resort to extreme toxicity become my target I prevent myself from ever being friends with these toxic racist and homophobic groups and try my best to ridicule them and take them out this new shopfront griefing strategy we used in this video is probably the most aggressive form of trolling people and thus the most salt inducing groups get particularly mad when we do it but we would only use this method on groups who take toxicity to the extreme this time we took it to the next level because we knew who they were if you want to do something similar to what we did here I suggest that you save it for the worst cases of toxic people you meet because this new method can bring out the worst in groups so guys let's get to the video I'm happy you're all here and you the salt the following is vanilla rest [Music] [Music] the guys we went deep on are on the top of this mountain we got so much from them oh yeah it's still there but that's our TC we grieve them air drop
