this video is made possible by brilliant dog if you live in the northern hemisphere right now you might have noticed that it's really rather hot in the UK we're experiencing a weeks-long heatwave so severe that when it rained recently it was greeted with jubilation in England in Sweden a surge of wildfires has occurred including more than a dozen inside the Arctic Circle where temperatures of topped 30 degrees and in Japan an unprecedented heat wave has killed more than 65 people in a single week it's all but impossible to sleep horrible to work outside and the land itself is shriveling up so why is this happening well as always seems to be the case there are three main cause wait no no no no no not yet cause number one the Atlantic more specifically the ocean's surface temperature the surface temperature in the North Atlantic varies in a complex fashion every day but underneath that variability there's a seesaw pattern if you look at the average monthly temperature in the Atlantic over several decades you see this oscillation between warmer than average and colder than average temperatures this is called the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation or amo and it's caused by the huge ocean circulation known as the a Mach as well as surprisingly clouds I'll leave a link below to a paper if you're interested in fact every time you see a number on the screen that's a reference in the description whether the Atlantic is in a warm or a cool phase has a huge impact on parts of the climate like hurricane formation Arctic sea ice cover and global temperatures and right now the amo is in a very positive phase meaning that the Atlantic is really warm compared to normal that has a direct effect on the continents surrounding the Atlantic with lots more thermal energy in the northern hemisphere warming Europe and North America and making Africa and Europe wetter while making North America drier wait what the UK resembles Tatooine right now incidentally it might like the video I did about the planets in star wars well the relationships presented in these papers show what happens on average so on average in the past when the Atlantic has been warmer than normal Europe has been wetter than normal what the average response doesn't account for is the effects of other climate phenomena and variability on the weather such as cause number two the jet stream being particularly weak the jet stream is a narrow band of fast-moving air that circles the North Pole ten kilometers up typically between about 50 and 60 degrees north it's caused by the temperature difference between the pole and the equator combined with the rotation of the earth and it's a major factor in what weather we get in the middle attitudes at the moment the Jetstream is particularly weak meaning that the air in the jet is moving slower than normal or so that the me and as we see in the jet stream aren't moving from west to east as fast as normal because the jet stream marks a boundary between colder polar air and warmer temperature if meanders in the jet stream stay put for a while that means that regions south of the jet stream experience warmer than average temperatures for a long time and conversely regions north of the jet experience colder than average temperatures for a long time the UK and Scandinavia as well as lots of other places I didn't mention are all south of the jet stream and have been for a while high pressure systems have been sat on top of these places and refused to budge that means the colder air and moisture struggles to get in and alleviate the hot dry conditions on the flipside Iceland for example has had its greatest wettest summer since 1914 that's because Iceland has been on the other side of the jet stream sitting further north amongst the persistently cold temperatures so Iceland has been cold and wet the lucky bastard so what caused the jet stream to be so weak and stationary well that's quite possibly reason number three global warming the world is warmer now than it was before the Industrial Revolution warming faster than any natural cycle allows for and that warming is directly attributable to human activities notably the release of gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere there is no debate the science is unequivocal if you dispute any of those facts then you are wrong the globe isn't warming evenly however due to a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification the poles are warming faster than the rest of the planet which reduces the equator to pole temperature gradients and because the jet stream is fed by that temperature gradient this results in a weaker jet stream with bigger meanders and the bigger the meanders in the jet stream theory tells us that the more slowly they're gonna move around the earth so we get persistent weather patterns like Japan and the UK and Iceland are experiencing as with all weather events it is nigh on impossible to directly attribute a particular event to global warming these conditions could well have occurred in an atmosphere without a single molecule of anthropogenic origin but what we're observing at the moment certainly matches what we would expect to see in a planet that has undergone global warming and apart from the weaker Jetstream and persistent associated high pressure systems the warming caused by these local short-term weather systems gets added on top of the decades-long pattern of global warming we've seen to give record temperatures in fact the weak Jetstream and warm Atlantic also occurred together in 1976 when the UK had a record-breaking heat wave which is now regarded as a yardstick event this current weather is the most severe heat wave the UK has seen since then and monthly average temperatures are higher in some parts the country now than they were in 1976 so thanks to global warming extreme events are getting that bit more extreme and research indicates that there'll be more frequent to this summer in the northern hemisphere is a good example of what climate change is probably going to look like this century when factors come together such as a warm Atlantic and a wheat jet stream the additional heat trapped in the Earth's system by anthropogenic emissions will take what would have been a big weather event and make it an extreme one highs will get higher and as we saw this winter with the beast from the east you might want to watch my video about that the lows will get lower in some places too but the net effects will be trending towards a warmer on average climate so when will this current heat wave end in the UK well where there's notoriously difficult to predict long-range forecasts from the UK Met Office indicate that the summer isn't going to cool off significantly by mid to late August the high pressure system just isn't budging most likely it's going to be uncomfortably warm with a few cooler days until September and then of course the weather will have to change because you know seasons but weather prediction is incredibly difficult especially when looking more than about a week ahead so this may well turn out to be wrong for the time being keep hydrated avoid the central line check on elderly neighbors and if you can enjoy the Sun responsibly this video thanks to brilliant for sponsoring this video and thank you for watching it I hope I was able to provide a little bit more detail than just it was the jet stream that did it Lowell if you did enjoy it please do leave a comment down there in the comments section I would love to do more videos on atmospheric topics and I basically I just don't know if people would watch them it's my forte it's what I know the most about I'd like to make more videos about it but I could do with a bit of feedback on this so if you enjoyed the video do drop a like leave a comment check out the references in the description and I'll see you in the next one thank you again for watching
