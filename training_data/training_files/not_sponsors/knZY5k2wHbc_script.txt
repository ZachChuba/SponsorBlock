hi everyone welcome back to my channel algae queen home decor my name is Linda and I'm really excited you're here thank you for watching if you're new here I would love to have you part of my YouTube family so please subscribe and turn on the bow notification so you can be notified when I upload a new video in today's video I'm making a couple of spring and summer home decor DIYs that are very affordable and beautiful so if you're interested keep on watching for the first DIY you will need a floral wreath from Dollar Tree six flower bouquets from Dollar Tree wire cutters a hot glue gun white paint a paintbrush a welcome Sun from Hobby Lobby and ribbon starting off I'm using my wire cutters to cut off the stems and I'm going to leave about an inch and a half to place in the wreath [Music] then once I have all of my stems cut off I'm going to grab a piece of ribbon and make it not to be able to hang it on the wall you can even use the longer piece of ribbon and make a bow to hang it on the wall which would look really pretty and girly I tied it about three times and then I used my scissors to cut off the excess ribbon [Music] video now let's go ahead and continue with our spring and summer DIYs here added hot glue to the wreath to add the flowers with stems I'm going to repeat this step all throughout until the wreath is completely covered [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I purchased this floral vase from Dollar Tree and added thin rhinestone wrap on top of the vase followed by gluing these rhinestone beads you can find them on Amazon I'll leave a link to them in my description box with everything else you'll need for these guys [Music] I added white rocks from Dollar Tree because they automatically bring a spring and summer vibe and I placed a silver Tila in the middle of the rocks for lighted decor here's how the first DIY turned out and I'm going to show you how you can style these DIYs in different ways other than this setup that you see here I'm going to make a spring welcome wreath out of this DIY and then use a glam base with rocks as part of my living room table decor let me know which style is your favorite [Music] [Music] that purchased this welcome sign from Hobby Lobby and it was $5.99 but I used a 40% off coupon that I got online make sure to use a coupon every time because they have them available on their website if they aren't already 50% off at the store when I finished painting I let it dry for 30 minutes and then I add in my e6000 glue to the backsides of the welcome sign make sure you use a real paintbrush I used the one that I had because I didn't have a paintbrush on hand and it was late when I was making this DIY to go out and buy another one [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'll let the glue dry overnight and then hung it on the wall using a command hook these DIYs are very simple and easy to make I highly recommend making your own and if you do please share them with me on my Instagram it's LD quaint home decor I would love to see and share your pictures [Music] for the last DIY you will need one long block of floral foam three floral bouquets of your choice i have peonies and elias i found these really pretty mirror mini vases at dodge who knew they would be perfect to create floral arrangements I've seen similar vases at home kids but for a dollar you can't beat it then when the season changes you can switch out the florals these were such a great find the foam is really easy to cut with a knife so be careful [Music] [Music] [Music] you can pick whatever color you want I chose these hot pink and white florals because to me they scream spring and summer what are the colors you're using to decorate this season [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] here's how this DIY turned out I made three mini floor arrangements and added a mirror from Dollar Tree right under each of them see can see how it looks if you wanted to do it for your home this DIY would look even more beautiful with the rhinestone mirror display I made in a recent video I'll leave the link to that in my description box if you want to see what I'm talking about and I'm telling you guys you will love it this last ki is the most easiest and has such a beautiful and glam I'll come I picked up a spring mini plastic tray that says hello from Dollar Tree now in my favorite rhinestone wraparound it I cut the rhinestone wrap to fit the sides of the tray and I'll leave the link to this rhinestone wrap in my description box [Music] [Music] I knew this little tray would be perfect for placing my keys on the entryway table you can even use this to place your jewelry or makeup on top this concludes today's video thank you for watching and I want to give a special thanks to everyone
