know you did i know for a fact you did well i don't know for a fact but you'd be able to fix i did what you got you got like 32 obsidian or something stupid or 20 20. you're 20. why did i say 32. oh what there's more obsidian oh my god this is your initial portal wait is it why is that obsidian here what happened there's like extra obsidian here yeah yes where are you ah what am i meant to do i actually can't do anything this is where the portal was it was like this and then you mined it so you had enough just to make another one and then you ran off to wherever you had to go and then when i came through it just won a bottle right next to it you thought it would just take me somewhere random so i just need to get lucky and find the same fortress as you otherwise it's literally game over what oh no god okay the race is on well even if i find a fortress it might not even be the same one as yours i could just spend forever looking around on it i don't know like i feel like i've messed this up even if i find the fort a fortress not necessarily the same one you're in even if even if it's the one that you're in i might not even find you and then i'm just lost i'm stuck in the in the nether i don't know where i am well then you should have thought about that oh i need these what am i doing yes oh wait can i yeah i can't right what yeah i definitely can your compass doesn't work in another right no a dream dream i see a spawner there's no way if you're here please you're not here this could i don't even know if i'm in the same phone i don't even know if i'm in oh what what the hell dream dream yeah there's no way i actually found the same place what the what are the odds of that where are you what do you mean would you what what do you mean i just i came to the portal like two seconds after you where are you oh my god that was so scary i just you could have stopped me from making that portal you just didn't see me i saw you when i was making the portal i should have just not said anything i thought the chances of that actually being your the same uh spawner that you were out was like basically zero because i just ran around and just found it so did you like my my bodyguards are on the portal i did not they maybe if they weren't there actually i would have got they wait they wasted like two minutes of my time probably would have because you got there right at the end they literally wasted like a minute or two of my time at least oh yay what genre wow congratulations how many more you need 10 i see an enemy as well what the hell there's anyone everywhere and i dropped a pearl what you doing george i'm just cooking some food right now actually thanks for asking nothing oh i should have what the hell dream what do i do if you look away i'm just gonna fall what i i was looking around for the enduro yeah and then because like because i threw it and it just like i don't know if maybe it broke i don't know but i couldn't find it and then you were just there dream just accept the feet just accept it are you going to block off the top except defeat what are you doing i actually don't know what are you doing can i purl through you or will it hit you
