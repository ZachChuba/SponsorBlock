teacher picked a new student to answer the question okay we got this guy fart dead and every time the answer was correct square root is 6625 I don't even know that dude that's hard 25 oh yeah I guess you're right how is that possible um because it's a good teacher I don't freaking know because they're cheating I think it's cause they're just really smart kids that's probably why boom the teacher
