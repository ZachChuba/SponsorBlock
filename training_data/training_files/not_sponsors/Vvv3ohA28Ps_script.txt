so YouTube's big like really big and only getting bigger and standing out as a creator becomes more and more challenging day after day it's hard to get started it's hard to get noticed so every six months or so on this channel I'm committed to aiding in that effort by highlighting five cool channels with less than 1000 subscribers these are the diamonds in the rough the channels that are on to something but just need a push in the right direction or a little bump in viewership to take things to the next level some of them might be up your alley some of them might not be but at the conclusion of this video I encourage you to check the links in the description watch a few of their vids give each of them a chance and if you find something that tickles your fancy be a pal and give them a sub it'll make their day for sure and it might get you in on the ground floor with the next great creator alright let's get into it channel number one epoch documentaries 237 subscribers the dictionary defines an epoch as an event or time characterised by a distinctive development or by a memorable series of events and that theme is at the heart of this uk-based channel that focuses on short documentaries about people places and inspiring stories I'm gonna go ahead and say it this is some of the best cinematography and editing I've ever seen from a small channel the images are stunning and why this channel hasn't taken off yet is a mystery to me I've watched about three different stories on this channel and each hold at my heartstrings and it's a welcome escape from the hyperactive over-the-top noise drummed up by many popular documentary based creators out there if you want to watch videos that take you out of yourself and into another place to learn more about the world and the vast and differing array of people who live in it epoch is worth adding to your sub box channel number 2 a film by cam 757 subscribers cams channel has probably the coolest aesthetic I've seen in a long long time the best way I can think to describe his videos is that they're what you get when you combine a slice-of-life vlog with sleek and colorful motion graphics rather than just a boring straight-up selfie cam fills the screen with infographic that propel the narrative of each video forward and summarize the main talking points of each piece he's not really tackling any deep subjects here his videos have yet to clock over two minutes but the short runtime means that he's removed all of the meandering material guys like me put in and makes each second of each story he tells count watching this small but growing collection of uploads was a real treat you can get through all of them in the time it takes to watch like one of my videos and he's definitely inspired me to try more short form stuff in the future if you want some quick but slick clips of a guy experimenting with the vlogging genre in some exciting new ways go watch his channel and subscribe for more channel number three every day I 327 subscribers every day I is a channel from Jordan Herod a PhD student from Harvard MIT Health Sciences and Technology she's studying neural engineering brain machine interfaces and machine learning and her YouTube channel is dedicated to breaking down the ways that we interact with artificial intelligence every day Jordans videos aren't flashy you're not gonna find a ton of snappy motion graphics or animated stuff like on other educational channels but you will find some well-thought-out and insightful information about how technological advancements are changing the face of the world as we know it I've been experimenting with some AI programs on and off the past year for a few personal projects but I'll be honest and saying I am completely uneducated about how pretty much anything in that area even works Jordan's videos are targeted toward laypeople such as myself and they offer a way to more easily understand the complicated nuances of today's artificial intelligence she uploads on a regular basis and it seems to me will only improve as the days go by I get a lot of motion graphics artists who offer to demo their services for my channel if you're one of them I want you to try this instead instead of working with me contact Jordan or creators like her and collaborate together to make something truly great this is the kind of channel that has a great foundation and could really benefit from talented and aspiring video editors offering to help boost the production value so you know make it happen YouTube really needs more educational content from people in specialized fields every day.i shows great potential in this respect so consider subscribing today channel number four new are 969 subscribers almost over the mile marker it's tough to be an animator on YouTube but videos take way longer to produce often have a shorter watch time and are hard to get seen if centered around an original story or IP all of these factors make it harder to succeed algorithmically noir is a small-time animated series by Dan Markowitz it's a pun filled comedy detective show that spans multiple seasons with a cast of not so colorful characters all against the backdrop of a period gumshoe mystery these videos are goofy to say the least they don't take themselves too seriously and encapsulate perfectly how platforms like YouTube allow up-and-coming artists to share their work with others while simultaneously honing their craft to get better and better the episodes particularly the earlier ones are rough around the edges sound design and mixing needs some work and the voice-over definitely bends a bit too much in the chesse direction for most folks tastes but for its occasional shortcomings noir shows great promise and potential if anything getting over the 1k subscribers milestone might open up some more opportunities for Markowitz to further his animation career and create more goofy adventures for years to come and that future could very well be a click away from happening wouldn't it be cool if that click came from you finally channel number 5 hazard time 640 subscribers so let me tell you a story of an absolute mug half-life 3 the long rumored never announced greatest mystery and PC gaming has become an almost universal internet meme at this point the game's production company valve has famously kept mum about the current status of the title with only the occasional leak from ex-employees trickling through the tubes of the internet to shed light on why the game has yet to be released details are often hard to come by but what if there was a channel where one man kept us up to date every day on new developments about the title today is January 27th 2019 and this is your daily halflife3 update there is no news about half-life 3 and that has been your daily half-life 3 update this is the kind of quality that I could only dream of and with almost 650 total uploads he certainly got the consistency thing down it is high time that his hard work and patience is rewarded I encourage everyone to check his channel out I'm sure it'll make his day so there you go that's it for this installment I hope you do your best to support some of these folks and if you're an up-and-coming creator I hope it's encouraged you to keep going remember that the best way to support small channels is to share them so don't just sub and call it good tell other people about these channels too the more we help out undiscovered talent the brighter the future can be if you've got you
