[Music] I wasn't always into street photography I think I had this stereotype in my head that Street photographers were people who had to go up to strangers and ask to take their portraits on the street and have to deal with 90% rejection rates or people who hidden shadows and town squares and shot people from a distance hoping not to get noticed but sometimes you do and you got to deal with conflict and that just didn't fit who I was but about three years ago I decided that I really needed to take my Instagram game seriously because there's a modern photographer it's a great way to promote yourself online and so I made a rule for myself to go out and at least shoot one photo everyday and try and post and initially I started on my phone because there was no way that I was going to carry backpacks of DSLRs and lenses every day it was just impractical and because I live in a big city it ended up being that I would just shoot what I saw walking around every day and looking back over the first six months I think I saw that what I was shooting was of the street was it the stereotype of what we think of when we think street photography I mean little bits of it were but most of it definitely wasn't and looking at it I had to kind of redefine what street photography was for me that very narrow stereotype I think a lot of us hold on to and so my idea of what street photography is is definitely broadened over time I'm in Rome at the moment so I thought I would just take a little bit of time to talk to you about my street photography philosophy in the hope that it helps you check out some of the stereotypes you have about the narrow thing street photography has to be and to broaden your idea of it a little bit and hopefully it gives you the guts to go out there and shoot your own take on the streets where you live [Music] so let's start with the stereotype I mean the question I get asked the most on my Instagram by far is how do you take photographs of people on the street which has always confused me a little bit because if you look through my Instagram account you can see I don't really do that I did once and it didn't turn out that well I was walking through a Shoreditch and this guy came up to me great looking rust a guy and he said to me hey I saw my camera in my head and said do you want to take a photograph of me and I thought great lovely opportunity a bit of a street portrait I don't normally do it and he's done the hard work for me so I still lined him up with a nice background posed him in a little bit and took the shot and instantly he goes five pounds please and now I'm stuck and of course it was a hustle so I handed over 5 pounds awkwardly I figured he needed the money more than me we didn't agree on terms I didn't feel like the conflict and that's of course what he was banking on and then two of his friends come and go hey we want photos as well I'm like well now this is just a bad situation so I quickly took his email address so I could email in the photograph and I left and I wasn't unhappy with the photograph but the whole experience was a negative experience for me it made me feel very uncomfortable and this is why I don't take photos of people on the street because I don't enjoy those kind of interactions and I'd rather just walk around anonymously if you want to shoot people on the street if that's your choice I think you're gonna have to get used to the fact that it's uncomfortable I get the feeling that people ask me the question about shooting people on streets because they want me to give them a trick that suddenly makes it a comfortable thing to do and no photographer can do that for you it's not comfortable if you want to shoot portraits you're gonna have to approach people and ask them and involve them and most people will reject you it's not personal it's just they don't know what you're doing with the image they're not sure why you're there they might not have the time for you don't take it personally if it's important to you ask and understand that it's going to be a 90 percent failure rate and that's normal and it's okay and when you take their photo be kind about it involve them in the process show them the photos you're taking take their details down so you can send them the photograph later don't be a brusque Elden about it make sure that you are generous in the way that you approach and involve people in what you're doing and then if you're taking photographs of people as part of a scene which I sometimes do just to give a sense of scale or space or action within the scene I think legally you are allowed to do that and it's okay and you're within your rights to do that but my general rule is the largest someone appears in my frame the more responsibility I put on myself and this is personal to delete that photograph if someone has a problem with it if someone notices me taking photographs of a scene in there in the shot and they come up and go I want you to delete that photograph which has happened on the rare occasion if they appear very small in a big frame and it's a photograph of the space I'll probably tell them no I was just shooting the space unfortunate you're in the shot but you know it's you we can't really see you and it's not important and I'll walk away now I'll hold my legal right in that case but if they're large in the frame and they do make a big part of the subject for the image and they are upset about that for me personally it's likely that no single image is worth me ruining my day and their day and I'll probably just delete it to keep them happy and move on and keep shooting and that's just a personal choice for me [Music] I'll talk about gear really quickly I've got the Fuji XT 20 that's when I'm running around with with the 23 mil f2 lens which is nice and compact and it's a really sharp little lens to use I assumed when I got this actually that I'd be using the 35 mil lens more often because it would give me a 50 mil equivalent and it used to be my favourite focal length but I think sometime in the last year when I've been using the Fuji x100s - that 23 mil lens which is a equivalent 35 mm focal length and so 95% of the time this is the lens that I'm using for street photography I'm shooting JPEG on this I know that'll be sacrilege to some of you and I'm usually using the classic chrome preset on this I like the idea of it feeling a little bit old-school like I'm selecting my my film stock before I even go out and because the street photography that I do I'm not going to be so precious about you know I need RAW files and pixel beep and really dig in later this is far more for fun than just experimentation I don't feel the need to shoot raw and ironically in the time that I've been using this on JPEG I've not once felt gee I really needed the extra dynamic range and I wish I've shot in raw as well and the other reason that I shoot JPEG and it's a really practical one is that I edit on my phone and I bought the iPhone 6 a few years ago and any one they had in store at the time was a 16 gig so I have this tiny phone in terms of storage and I'm constantly battling with that so JPEG is the best solution for me raw is great I would always shoot professionally I would definitely shoot raw but JPEG is absolutely good enough for this and speaking of your phone I think you know I get a lot of people saying to me I wish I have money for a really good camera so I could be a really good photographer still and I've said this before probably 60 70 % of my Instagram account is shot on my phone and I got some really great shots out of this shot so I'm really really proud of and I'll show you a little trick that I used to use when I was shooting on my phone to do street photography because I found I could get close to people if I wanted to get someone in this shot and was able to do it far more anonymously is if you have your headphone jacks into the bottom and headphone in your ear and I'm often walking around and just pretending I'm listening to something or even you can pretend you're talking on the phone I can be holding my phone like this and if you have the camera app open I didn't I don't know if you know this but your volume control on your headphones actually triggers the camera so that means that you could just be fiddling with your phone like this and have your headphones over here you don't even have to really be looking you can sort of line your shot up quickly look away press your headphone jack on on on here your little volume control and you can take the photo without them even noticing so that was a nice little trick but really it doesn't matter I mean you know that I don't get obsessed with gear and the rest of it choose a camera that makes you feel comfortable that gives you a good image quality and lets you walk around without feeling too self-conscious about it [Music] so if I don't shoot people what do I shoot and I've done a bit of thinking about this and I think that for me it's about spaces but particularly the interplay with light and shadow in this spaces and I know how broad that sounds but if you've ever walked around a city and you're kind of round a corner and something about that scene just sort of catches your breath a little bit maybe if you're not a photography you're not really sure what you're looking at you just look and say well that's a beautiful scene but hopefully as photographers we can look and understand that it's because the elements and the way that they're composed or the lights that's bouncing around in that space was something to do with that and in my photography I want to especially when I'm shooting on the street capture that feeling of being in that space and I like the fact that it's it's different from my day work my day work is very people focus portrait focused like subject focused but my street photography is a lot wider and broader and it's a lot more about space in context so walking around I don't feel that's wasted time I'm learning the whole time about colors and how to shoot wider and how to compose a background in space so that when I am shooting contextual portraits with a client or with somebody for four for paid work all that stuff is logged away in the back and it's actually enriching my portrait work as well where people come in with Street portraiture or street photography rather is that sometimes when you've got that space you just need that little bit that little element to kind of ground the scene a little bit so when I'm looking and there's a pool of light that's being cast in the middle of a square or something the shot on its own is beautiful and it's pleasing but it needs something just to give it a sense of scale maybe so what I'll do is I'll camp out in that spot I will dial in my exposure so it's expose for the highlights I'll let the shadows fall quite dark and I'll wait for people just to walk through that scene and snap off shots and then when I get back later and I'm looking through the photograph I might I might have maybe 10 photographs of that space with people walking through and one of those shots hopefully something about the way that they're walking or standing or moving through that space makes that whole composition just snap into focus and everything feels like it's in its right place and that the one that I'll edit work on and post I think I had a little bit of an insecurity for a while about you know is this legitimate street photography if it's not focusing on people and maybe that's my own strange stereotype maybe there's a stereotype you have but someone commented on one of my Instagram photos a little while ago and they said your work especially this photograph reminds me of fan hos work and I wasn't really familiar with fan ho and I looked him up and you should look in about two he he was a Hong kong-based street photographer and he shot black and white most he very very contrasty exposed for the highlights dark shadows worked on a lot of geometrical shapes a very filmic feel and people in his shots were very very incidental to the composition just to provide a bit of grounding for it and that kind of gave him permission to follow this track that I was following and I think it reminded me and I've said it on this channel before but it reminded me that to have heroes in any kind of space in your photography is super important because not that you're going to go out and just try and copy the work they do but it gives you a target to aim for loosely and gives you permission to move in a particular direction and then hopefully over time it just means that you're going to put your own spin on that sort of work [Music] so if you want to shoot people and that's the focus you want in your street photography I don't think there's any other way then put yourself in the uncomfortable situations go out there face the rejection and get the shots you want to get but if that's not you that's absolutely fine there are a host of other subject matters out there that you could be shooting pay attention to what you respond to and show us how you see the world because hopefully it means you're producing unique images and remember that this whole thing is a journey I mean this will be embarrassing but but go and look at my Instagram account if you want to see what I'm talking about and go back to the beginning and see how crap I was and how long it took me to define any kind of style that I'm even sort of happy with and I'm not even there yet it's still got a long way to go I've just got a direction that I can start walking and hopefully I'll get there in the long run so pace yourself and take that journey one click at a com
