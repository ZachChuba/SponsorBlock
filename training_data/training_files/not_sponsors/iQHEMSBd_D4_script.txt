no oh no way [Music] this is my hardcore ironman i can only play it in a pvp world and if you manage to kill me you win 500 million gold pieces today's adventure takes me to one of runescape's most notorious bosses zora the monster that took down the ogc engineer but now it's my turn to face my fate with the snake i will kill zoro 100 times or i will die hopefully i won't die i have a very long history of zorro on my original iron man i actually got my blowpipe just over a thousand kc but i died at the same time so i couldn't pick it up it then took me to over 3000 kc to get my second blowpipe two days later i got hacked for it and then on my pure iron man it took me nearly a thousand kills to get the blowpipe the tanzanite fang is my nemesis link in description good luck and i will see you there agility the funnest of skills i'm actually not 70 yet but i've been training over here at the polyvince rooftops because i can boost up with a potion and people won't suspect a thing the plan is to use the fairy ring to get to zoro which requires the stepping stone shortcuts which requires 76 agility this will be a lot faster than using the charter ship 70 agility now i can do pull of niche with no agility potion so people will suspect a thing look at this absolute shambles steel gloves it is time to get rid of these i need to upgrade to rune at least if we want to go and do some end game pvm i'm praying about i don't want to get you pulled out i've got to do this dialogue again are you serious let's not be an idiot [Music] [Music] i've come to the end of my journey of culinary exploration here only stopping at rune gloves even though i'm pretty close to barrows in terms of quest points but i don't want to do dragon slayer as i don't want dragon slayer tasks yet increased access to the culinary monster chest gives me rune gloves but maybe even more importantly a bunch of food that i can use to make pizzas for zoro that is gonna be my go-to food pineapple pizzas oh he started running i'm trying to load a client [Music] just call me papa john because i've got enough stuff to open up a franchise a pizza is right here gonna be making pineapple pizzas 22 heels lovely stuff i've actually got a lot of xp here 70 cooking for my activities here in the hasidius kitchen now i've unlocked the ability to make tuna potatoes it's quite a long process but they do heal 22 hit points per bite making them my best single eat food cooked up all my food for zoro pizzas potatoes guthix rests and prayer potions are all the consumable supplies that i'm going to be needing to do this 100 silver kills back to free running level 73 agility now i can plus the reboost with an agility potion and i can use the fairy ring to access zoro saving tons of time this is roughly my setup for zoro i've got the irons blast with the switch into the range the roon crossbow with the broad bolts not the best gear but i figure if i have the right strategy i can definitely make it work so apparently you need 76 agility to jump on a single stepping stone it must be absolutely covered in grease it is time 100 or death this is actually my second kill because i killed one back at level 42 combat and kicking off the zoro grind we got a dragon halberd and a new personal best of six whole minutes i think what's going to keep me alive at zora is formulating a plan for each rotation and then sticking to it and replicating it every single time so i won't be able to die now sounds great but mistakes do happen so i've got to be paying attention so much when i'm here however i figured out a decent amount of stuff right now and that is level 10 zul wreck completed 200 lawrence like look at the drops here they are absolutely unreal [Music] 39 hit points i am not staying there it can hit 41 so pretty decent telly need to be disciplined hey new pb and zora teleports i'm actually going to save them all up for a later date once zoro gets camped or i can do two kill trips manta rays also super good 22 heal food edible in one bite it's just like the tuna potatoes but now i've got a really consistent source of them hopefully we stack tons up ivan's blasting all fun and games until we have to take a trip to the gates of hell to recharge the thing [Music] no way oh my god i'm gonna die i got a tanzanite fight already on 36kc that's insane i actually feel like that's justified for my look in the past but that's crazy rng from this account all right we got the thumbnail give me that tanzanite fang the blue pipe all ready this is so early this is so it's gonna help out so much i can literally use on zora everything i got it so early i don't even have any darts in the entire bank what is going on gonna have to make some of those and we're gonna have to make the below pipe in my house they want to see people saying that i've got it probably the best range weapon i'm ever gonna get on this account the toxic blowpipe so overpowered and now i've got it after just 36 kills and i can't even wear it because i've got no darts to make darts i need bars to make bars you need ores where do you get oils from of course you buy them from a shop we're up here at blasphemous it's pretty risky i need a lot of inventory slots and the bank for some reason is not a safe zone in this area so i have to do this very quickly i'm super heating all the mithril ores because you must be mad if you think you're going to run back and forth to a furnace for five bars dart tips done get some insane fletching xp but that doesn't matter because now i can wear my toxic blowpipe ready to absolutely shred everything sixteen hundred darts on eight thousand scales they are probably gonna run out so fast one of the problems i faced using the blade pipe at zora is i've done so many kills with how to blow pipe it's alright i've never actually really taken my blowpipe to zoroa to use it so i have to amend my strategies somewhat because the blowpipe has a shorter range than a crossbow however it's a good problem to have isn't it we get a pb blowpipe is carrying me 49 kill counts now this is very important because when i get one more kill at 50 i appear on the high scores when i log out so i'm gonna wait for a long period of time where i can do a bunch of kills in one day without logging out and then we're gonna log out and appear on the high schools of like 80. of course killing the snake you get some snake skin for snake skin boots which are my best range boots for now what is that oh my days the look is coming in today brimstone key and a hardcore scroll in the same blood veld gear that is pretty unlikely blackbeah chaps only needed from this and that is just what i got what is this day my look oh that's really nice black d hide shops finally plus 20 magic defense to plus 28 with the black d high chaps gonna help out a ton 50kc it is now time for a very long zorro session because my logo i appear on the high schools i bought the zami flames along because i want to get really fast kills so i can knock out as many as possible [Music] 100 zoro kc and i am still alive to tell the tale after finishing the zoro goal i started to use all the skilling supplies on my account and that's pushed me over 1500 total level on the pvp hardcore ironman 100 zoro the toxic blowpipe and 1500 total i think i've done well this video
