welcome everybody back to another Dragonball Legends video today we will be showing off the new new in the anniversary brand new basically super Vegeta we're also gonna be doing some gameplay with the base vegeto as well he is now eligible for 6 stars if you guys can get him he is free because you know the events a little bit difficult but regardless we're gonna do some gameplay hope you guys enjoy of course hit that subscribe for new for more content I do 100% think this is the best unit the game he does a lot of damage I think that it's pretty close between him and Gohan but he wins ultimately because he could rule ball it go on buffs so there's that anyways without further ado epic champion to start your journey good luck and I'll see you there alright so we're up against asin team okay good that's that's cool that's fine by me uh so what we're gonna do is that right there alright fine number one of today's video I'm gonna go ahead and back out or not okay we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna okay cool okay all right I'm gonna go here I'm gonna go for the green all right cool so the way that you want to play with super potato is leave them out there as long as you can you also want a side step so you can draw an extra card he's a charge step whichever you prefer let me go here and hopefully with this next one I can draw another card there it is okay cool you want to leave him out here the thing about leaving him out is obviously people want to try to rush him so you don't want to get rushed i'ma go here cuz he's trying to do the same thing yeah he was trying to do the same thing I went first so I got priority uh I'll go with that I'm a rush that should KO him if I'm lucky anywhere imma go for the blast let see how much the strikes do okay the blast isn't doing too much this guy's that vegeto is actually very tanky yeah I figured I should work for strike I knew it already I absolutely knew it I absolutely knew it when I did I'm actually gonna switch him out or not I should've went for it they're two mistakes in a row I figure he's in a rush for me now is what it is if he doesn't rush this is actually very good I just spit all over the place and he doesn't rush me though okay he didn't rush me all right three mistakes three mistakes you can really say for cuz I left them out there it's right all is right with the world okay cool interesting interesting decision they're very interesting decision they're I'm gonna draw this and go for that goodbye Goku I'm gonna go for this here KO his super vegeto I've made mistake after mistake after mistake but it's not mattering alright cool so far so good go there and that's a KO yeah I was I had a hole and that was that was just gonna be a KO um I mean a number of mistakes like I said but it didn't wide it mattering the thing about super Vegeta like I said is you want to leave him out there and you don't leave math there as long as you can so he can accumulate the buffs because if you switch him in and out quite often they're gonna fall off and stuff like that but the thing is obviously if you leave him out there he becomes a rush target right if he was able to KO my Vegeta that would've been an entirely different thing I should have switched the vegeto out I got a little too comfortable having him out there but again if you can if you can play with that if you can leverage that then you're able to just do crazy amounts of damage with this guy okay our first matchup is versus hybrid Saiyans okay I feel it I feel like five star Gohan in that four star Goten fun fact those are the numbers of stars that I have on those two characters myself okay okay okay he's probably gonna bring those units in for sure I would say the good news is my natural setup has a very good counter already with these two so I'm actually bringing these characters with the flex option of doing this right but I generally do like to do this because it has very good coverage so we're gonna go head and bring this in I'm gonna assume the go tanks leads he goes with the go tanks the Gohan the Gohan I don't go to excuse me the Goten Gohan Gohan I was looking at that go on it are the Goten and Trunks in the front it made me think go tanks for some reason alright let's go ahead and get into it so our first fight of today's video um and you guys have not seen their recommended videos on the left-hand side of the screen currently the Zen o Goku and Vegeta over Ando Khan the two legends videos for the buff new characters make sure you check those out those will be down below in the description as well check him out after this one of course all rights first match he does go ahead and lead with the goat in like I thought and he brought the exact character is that that was the legends battle royale team he's gonna go Gohan here Hamlet ah I don't know he's gonna switch I was gonna say I'll just back out and try to let the Gohan drop in but it's fine it's not a big deal okay go there I assume you might try to switch again there it is these guys are good for the cover cut I'm gonna I'm gonna start playing around that I haven't been a drop comboing I'm gonna start drop comboing okay let me go for that this is annoying because I have to do this just to buy some time just to buy a little bit of time in fact I'm gonna go for the faint here it's not gonna do any damage but I'm gonna go for the faint cuz it should land oh this is that was a very poor switch I don't think he had time to go back to the other Gohan that was a very poor switch because he basically sacrificed him especially cuz you can't combo again in this chain okay he's lucky I'm not doing anywhere near enough damage nevermind overestimated how much the untransformed pujita would do I'm not a big deal though cuz we're gonna go to transform that was a very poor switch though nonetheless could have actually got blaster over there but it's fine okay Gohan coming in here or not I'm gonna go ahead and go for this just remove those buffs off this guy by the way that is such a oh my gosh are you serious I'm gonna go here that is such a the removal of buffs it's such a potent thing when it's up against this Gohan here like if you let this go on getting the point where he's like super buff to feel like a Goku going down or whatever you can just take all of that off man I gotta stop choosing strike because people always freaking choose strike and I always get guessed now I knew I should have chose that special move and I looked at it but yeah removing of buffs is crazy good especially you can do it to the Gohan okay oh okay I see you I see you yeah okay I was gonna say he's probably not gonna play yeah I've gotta stop juice to strike because I am getting guessed like it seems like every other game now and it's getting quite annoying because it's caused me to lose some games that I should 100% win but III will like get my rush cast once or twice I even had a video I think that was a hard fire scope coop video where I got guessed twice this new system the way that the the rushes work I'm getting guest a lot so I'm out to play around there but we'll be right back with our second fight in just a moment guys alright so we're up against a son family setup so I'm going to assume he goes go ten so I'm gonna try to use this new vegeto both vegeto is by the way I'm assuming that he goes with the legends battle royale champion type setup so anyways we're gonna go with vegeto vegeto and go tanks hope you guys enjoy and let's go ahead and get her right into it and okay so he brought okay he expected me to bring blue Gogeta but just funny i don't have any plans on that so it is what it is though a single blast hopefully vanishes there it is go straight into that he's gonna drop combo here oh he didn't interesting I expected him to 100% 100% expected him to go into the other Gohan for the cover change I'm gonna go for that that's fine at least he's not taking any damage right now he's gonna go for strike cards it's not a big deal I will keep my option to cover change eligible I'm not gonna do it right now though I'm gonna keep it though for the go tanks okay I'm gonna go for another one that GT Goku's basically dad in this matchup he is basically dead well to be fair he's not but it just depends on how you play that okay yeah I think I've already won this one no lie I think I've already won this one I could use that blast there I think I've already won this one yeah I've already won okay I'm gonna throw this here oh I tried to go for the rush but it didn't give me the chance to I needed like another split second I'm gonna go here make over that to force the vanish it might actually connect it might actually hit him okay it did cuz who's the middle of a main ability all right well that should be game alright I'm gonna go for this blast here all right cool that's a connection and that is a KO okay so this one is a mirror match okay gotcha he doesn't have the KO tank so he goes with the Raddatz which is the next best thing I'm going to assume that he brings blue Gogeta into this match I guess it doesn't really matter much but I would like simulate he brings the front three and he might make the Flex choice of bringing the base go tank so we'll see what happens all right next fight commence and it is a base vegeto mirror that's cool Matt it's cool let me go ahead and go there ah I knew that was gonna happen I should have held it longer I knew that was gonna happen I'll go here I'm gonna go for that let me go for this blast okay Oh interesting alright let me go for this and I will get my last dragon ball already that's nice probably lock me here he did not interesting he probably has a special movie wants to use which is annoying oh by vegeto maybe anyway we'll see we'll see we'll see hopefully hopefully by vegeto let go let me knock on wood oh there we go okay cool I just use a green card that all I always get confused by that it's like I'm not gonna have another one unless I have a card like weeds I'm not gonna have another one I just used it go for this and I'm actually gonna try to get it right here let's see if I can oh that threw me off that stands hopefully who goes for a card and he did alright I got saved there the stands threw me off big time oh my gosh I could have vanished if I was in charge oh my goodness that is so much damage for a literally no reason man alright yeah I figured I figured I figured
