Hello everyone! As most of you know, I have been really interested
in Bullet Journaling and getting more involved with the community, trying to find out new
ways to use my notebook and keeping productivity levels to the max. I decided to film this video since I was going
through a ton of the Bullet Journaling Amino posts and seeing that people want some ideas
on how to decorate their bullet journals. Bullet Journaling Amino is an app where you
can search for groups of people who are passionate about bullet journaling as a hobby and a lifestyle. It features tons of interesting challenges,
discussion and tutorials regarding bullet journaling and you’ll be amazed at the ideas
and tips that are shared over there. If you are new to this organization method
and have wanted to start for a while, getting in touch with people who are starting the
same hobby is a great way to get inspired. I’ve actually created a challenge that you
can try out for yourself, just click the link to my profile in the down-bar to get started. This video will be pretty self-explanatory. I will just show you how to draw banners and
bullet journal dividers to spice up your notebook. You need no artistic talent to make these,
since most of them are made just by connecting the dots. So keep on watching and let’s get started.
