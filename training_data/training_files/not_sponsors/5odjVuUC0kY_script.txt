if you've played minecraft for a while you have most likely heard of antvenom a popular minecraft youtuber who's been making minecraft videos for over nine years now during minecraft speak around 2012 to 2014 who's one of the top 5 most subscribed to minecraft channels and he was easily getting hundreds of thousands if not millions of views on his videos but starting around late 2014 and 2015 his channel seriously declined in popularity with his video struggling to achieve above 50,000 views his subscriber count also stagnated never going past 2.3 million and he was often losing subs daily his channel was dying and dying fast and it seemed that soon enough everybody would have forgotten about him but then he had a realization and save this channel and doing so unknowingly pioneered one of the most popular styles of Minecraft videos today so what happened let me first tell you a bit about him and his first Minecraft videos antvenom who's renamed is Taylor Harris upload his first video to his channel on January the 25th 2009 the video was a funny runescape skip and he has two more public videos of a similar style however it seems many episodes are missing so he could have in fact uploaded earlier but enough about runescape let's talk about his minecraft videos his first Minecraft videos actually weren't uploaded to his channel the rather on the machinima realm channel a channel which is no longer around the series named hunt for the Golden Apple was fortunately reuploaded by antvenom onto his second channel back in 2015 so the videos were not lost when machinima shut down the hunt for the Golden Apple took place in early 2011 during minecraft beta version 1.2 version 2 the series was basically a let's play but it was unique as I had an end goal in mind which was to find a golden apple golden apples were much rarer back in this version of the game in fact they were arguably the rarest item in the game only obtainable in dungeon chests combined with the fact that there were no sprinting or fast travel methods such as alight rows and tools such as chunk base with either not around or not commonly known finding a golden apple was a very tough feat the only way to find dungeons back then were to just explore cave systems and hope you're running into one or at least try to listen for multiple mobs in the same area and even if you do find a dungeon the chances of getting a golden apple were still incredibly low being one in 125 meaning there was only a 0.8% chance of the golden apples burning in a dungeon chest and the vast majority of the time would walk away empty-handed during November of 2015 after multiple seasons multiple episodes and after five years during a livestream he finally found a Golden Apple the series went through many ups and downs and its antvenom said himself he grew tired of the series a few times and would take breaks but almost 5 years later he came to an end the series was one of its first but also most popular series and what he was commonly known for back then so now this brings us back to his channel were the first publicly available minecraft video it's a seed showcase uploaded on March the 12th 2011 showcasing his hunt for the Golden Apple world seed which had only begun a few months prior and then and would do more similar series during this period of time when he would show off cool world CT found or hoodoo mod reviews and minecraft adventure maps' I'm not going to talk about all of these videos but notably he had one very popular mod review of the elemental creepers mod which at the time was one of the main videos which attracted new viewers to his channel the video currently has almost 8 million views and just reading through the comments you can see how many people discovered amber them through this video alone moving along and been in this series on the wildly popular mod at the time the aether name in the series aether mod adventure the first aether mod adventure was uploaded in July of 2011 and has over 1.7 million views he would continue the series but around episode 13 he stopped uploading for a few months coming back early next year with episode 14 telling his viewers that due to the new aether mod update was having technical difficulties with this world and struggled to up data he did manage to update the world but 14 was the last of the series antvenom also participated in one of the first ever survival games the youtuber survival games which featured a group of massively popular minecraft youtubers at the time his original survival games video uploaded back in early 2012 has over five million views he was victorious in this first survivor games killing CaptainSparklez in the final fire by finishing him off with a diamond sword after inflicting significant damage to him just earlier the nice bow shot which knocked him into lava not only would he win his first survival games but who also go on to win the next two in a row building a reputation for his PvP skills and venom also dabbled in speedrunning and one of his best speedrun attempts was over 6 million views on YouTube he also has made a few minecraft parody or original videos which have quite good animations such as through the night and the miner which is a parody of Gym Class Heroes the fighter these videos all did really well with the most popular getting 40 million views and all the others having over 25 million views let's talk about the minigame era of Minecraft now after the survival games blow up on YouTube other servers would begin including this game with is a minigame or some server to either set up just to run public survival games this is also where other minigames grew popular and more and more minigames servers began to pop up during late 2012 and most of 2013 and Benham and many other popular minecraft youtubers at the time would start uploading minigame videos such as survival games much more often this was the peak of Minecraft YouTube and during this time Minecraft viewership on YouTube was arguably at his highest along with the survival games he would also upload videos of the mini games such as spleef super craft brothers captured the flag and more he would also do many minecraft adventure maps' such as withers challenge and wrath of the Fallen both made by hypixel as well as parkour maps there are so many series and videos I haven't mentioned so you should go check out his channel for yourself and Venom also would often collaborate with other popular youtubers such as captain sparkles caveman films skydoesminecraft and more during 2013 we hit 1 million subscribers and later that year during october he would hit two million 2013 with only the best use for his channel and his growth at the time was exponential however during late 2014 and 2015 his channel began to see a serious decline in viewership as well as new subscribers his videos were struggling to get views some even failing to break 30 or 40,000 views which was terrible compared to the hundreds of thousands if not millions he was used to getting previously his channel also became stuck at 2.3 million and refused to budge as he continued to you lose more subscribers than who would gain daily as he said himself he felt that one of the main reasons his channel so such a decline was because he became comfortable with his position on YouTube and stopped innovating now Advent and made a video talking about why is channel declined in popularity so much but to summarize what he said he felt that originally his channel was somewhat informative and calm as you can see by his early series such as his Let's Plays seed showcases and mod views but when the minigame phase came around he said himself that he became loud and often at times of noxious this drove away many of his longtime viewers and caused subscriber base who may have been fed up with the minigame content or simply just grew out of it as it did tend to attract quite a young audience now this decline in popularity didn't only affect antvenom many other popular minecraft youtubers at the time who are doing a similar style of video also saw a massive decrease in viewership and subscribers such as Beijing Canadian and ace of Jerome however while they never really fully recovered antvenom did and here's how so a Burnham's view account was done his total subscribers were slowly decreasing so he decided to take a break from YouTube going on a road trip across America from this break he discovered that he still enjoyed making Minecraft videos just not the type he was making at the time and then one morning during 2016 he came to a realization that he needed to change his YouTube style from the live commentary gameplay style to the style we see today which is refined and polished post commentary video essays I guess upon announcing this he received a fair amount of backlash as he still had an active audience at the time which was watching his gameplay videos but he also had some support and decided to continue with it he uploaded his first video in the new style on August 28 2016 titled how to pass 30 million blocks in Minecraft the video currently has just under a million views and at the time did very well compared with other videos to say the least the video saved his channel it not only boosted his views but brought back many of his old fans and viewers as well as attracting new ones who also liked the style there was an almost instant difference and the amount of use he got that day was higher than he had had in a long time as you can see by this old graft he was constantly losing subscribers every day or struggling to get 100k channel views daily then after that video he started gaining more views actually gain subscribers and his channel began hurry fast forward about three to four months to December of that year and as you can see his channel is healthily growing again and his video views are mostly in the 200 thousands his channel had recovered and was growing once more his subscriber cow which was stuck at 2.3 million began to increase over time and fast forward another three years to September of 2019 and he hit three million subs as of current day at the time of this video he has 3.7 million subscribers and is still growing daily this channel getting almost 300,000 views every day it's safe to say that the stole of video successfully rejuvenated his channel giving it a fresh and new feel as I mentioned earlier ant-man have initially said his first channel star was calm collected and informative and one of the main reasons he began to decline in popularity is that he changed too loud and somewhat obnoxious at times what's interesting is that his new style went back to the calm collected informative way and doing so rejuvenated his channel so the type of videos which added venom makes don't really have a particular name which they can be referred to like gameplay videos do they could be called video essays short documentaries or many other things and aren't just exclusive to Minecraft or even exclusive to gaming and venom didn't invent this style but he certainly pioneered it at least within the Minecraft community many other popular minecraft channels such as fit MC and salty one as well as myself follow a very similar high quality style and fit MC has even credited antvenom with helping him get his channel back on track and look at fit MC now most of his videos get a million views I can definitely say myself that admin and videos were a huge inspiration for my channel and I'm not sure I'll be making the same videos if it weren't for him but anyways that's the story of antvenom one of the few big minecraft channels who still consistently uploads and gets used to this day he turned his chin around for the better and doing so pioneered a popular type of niche in the Minecraft YouTube community I hope you do now be sure to subscribe thank you so much for watching [Music] you
