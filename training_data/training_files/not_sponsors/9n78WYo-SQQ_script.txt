the following video was brought to you by curiosity Street how the hell do you write an elegant introduction to a topic like this on a platform like this okay this year's Backstreet Boys reunion tour has prompted a lot of self-reflection including me having to seriously try and answer one of these stupidest questions that I did expect I'd eventually have to confront at some point in my lifetime can an entire lifetime of playing video games help people understand a crisis it would make sense right it's not that stupid of a question right video games at least market themselves as simulating the invisible systems that run society and the choices that incentivize the world's most powerful people into making the decisions they do and then the interest of critical thinking it's impossible for me to deny the place my imagination goes to when trying to visualize what's happening when those systems in the real world are evidently failing strategy games which we got to be thinking critically about right for all the temptation there is these days to insist that games can be made without some kind of political bias tacked on a strategy game that takes place in our real actual world is one setting where that whole argument is absolutely inapplicable the developers got to make a conscious decision on what percentage tax rate is going to start pissing off their simulated society so here's an attempt to thinking critically about the foundational pop cultural influences that will be informing the imaginations of three generations who are going to be growing old while tackling Earth's next big problem climate change which is a problem people have known about since the 80s the 1880s that is but I was surprised to see that this wasn't a big theme in video games from the 1980s then again climate change was not a big theme in the public consciousness until Antarctic scientists discovered the hole in the ozone layer in 1985 the summer of 1988 was the hottest on record when NASA scientists testified about the problem to Congress a year before the UN established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change a year before Maxis released sim Earth will right zoomed the perspective of simulated city all the way out into orbit with players adjusting environmental variables for their own simulated planet starting by carefully adjusting geologic and orbital factors until it can support life then making it create life then making that life go on to develop intelligence and civilizations in industrial technology and then prevent them from destroying themselves with that technology nowadays it would come off as some kind of avant-garde hippie dippie indie game art experiment for a strategy game where the goal is to not conquer your enemies but rather achieve world peace yet here we have it as a mainstream edutainment release for the whole family way back in 1990 in the game scenario for a modern earth from 30 years ago your mission is to solve all the world's problems lead us into a future of peace abundant food clean air and plentiful energy by sliding around meters representing the output of the grand total of humanity's expended energy note this scenario is difficult but still more fun than the real thing although that warning might be a bit too earnest all you have to do to get everyone to agree to cut down on fossil fuels is slide the fossil fuel meter down what's more challenging is playing out what happens if you don't it's notable that of all the games on this list and even with the restrictions imposed by those scenarios sim earth is more of a flexible open-ended toy the strategy play comes in in scenario modes and the implications educate the player more about the consequences of environmental changes but less so about the incentives that plug into all the economic decisions that are made on the planets way there which is what the entire civilization series is gonna be doing for let's face it the rest of this video 30 years of sequels are going to be exploring the dilemmas of weighing short-term boosts against long-term sustainability under the presumption that your decisions are carrying historical centuries-long consequences the first sid meier's civilization from 1991 shows the series handling international nationalism at its most brutal the tutorial is more honest here than in the later games a lie with the stronger SIVs isolate and destroy the weaker sibs while the organic natural world around you is already commodified and partitioned off into a grid without you having to play through whatever conflict would have created that land management system in the first place sieve one's vision for the future is not particularly detailed past that early 90s optimism of believing the Cold War was forever over and we were at the end of history the long-term consequences of researching industrialization and the automobile is global warming indicated by an ominous red orb that steadily turns white-hot spawning in fields of pollution that if not taken care of turn coastal land into swamps and Plains into desert forcing a change in late-game strategy that intensifies a space race to just launch a ship a colonist offworld and leave earth behind but it's notable that global warming is not exactly a devastating consequence if it happens at all which is quite possible if you play through a game where those technologies never become mainstream according to the game's rules the next big problem facing humanity sure does exist there's no denying it but it is just too simple clicks away from cleaning up meanwhile outside of video games environmentalism becomes a big theme in pop culture while efforts were being made to phase out the production of ozone depleting CFCs around 1995 and 96 is civilization to intensifies the environmental concerns up quite a notch pollution tiles are now a chilling skull instead of fields of gunk and if left to linger the global warming effect can quite easily screw everything up it can be avoided by early investment into mass transit recycling or solar energy but if you have to play through a game while enduring the effects of global warming it is killer almost turning the competition into more of a contest of who can survive rather than who can win coastal tiles and a hell of a lot of them at that turn into unproductive swamps combine that with cleaning up the pollution and your settler units require twice the clicks and twice the time to correct these negative environmental effects which come in and almost twice the speed this snowballs into problems affecting hunger and rioting and cycles that repeat because apparently the ice caps can melt over and over again forever let it get out of control and your productivity will grind to a halt as your attention is pulled away from other crisis's to clean up the skulls instead remember back in 2012 a reddit post blew up or some guy had been playing the same game of sieve for ten years and turned everything into continents of irradiated flooded wasteland where the cities of the future were built around mountaintops instead of rivers and coastlines that was sieve too as the 90s rolled on environmental concerns were still on the zeitgeist radar in 97 Bill Clinton signed the u.s. into the Kyoto Protocol pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2012 and for a few short years of the late 90s mainstream pop culture settled on the kind of future it was popularizing for the kids the cyberpunk dystopia for the primary bad guy and a lot of pop culture was a conspiracy of corporate and government greed that latex black nihilistic posthuman vision of a dispassion and digital dystopian is wonderfully evoked by sid meier's alpha centauri from 1999 which follows a game of sieve and too speculative hard science fiction but the issues faced here are surprisingly steeped in more ecologically conscious mechanics than the games based on boring ol planet Earth colonizers escaping a dying earth become post human cyber people who explore the most extreme questions of ethics via a gameplay inspired by some extremely uncomfortable technological possibilities starting with you facing incentives to go down an upgrade tree that has you destroying this fresh new alien planet intentionally right out of the gate with the knowledge of heavy industry and it's heavy productivity already having been known resources exist to be consumed and consumed they will be if not by this generation then by some future by what right does this forgotten future seek to deny us our birthright none I say let us take what is ours chew and eat our fill CEO dois buddha ke morgan the ethics of greed take this route and the lessons of history will be deliberately nihilistic Lee rejected with full conscious awareness of what you're doing the planet itself is treated as a kind of living character you even have a sort of dialogue with in regards to the minute-to-minute game play decisions the stuff you do to your land directly affects the other factions and destroying the environment can actually be used to your advantage raising the temperatures and melting the ice caps can increase the harvest of edible ocean born alien fungus and can be used to deliberately drown out the other player cities but is all that ecological damage intensifies into a likely late-game apocalypse mechanics merge with narrative as great bonuses trigger great disasters AI leaders change their minds and plans don't go how the flavor text predicted the realization sets in that even all the way out here nature is still a more powerful force than humankind that is our last-ditch attempt to win humanity every free from extinction at the hands of an awakening alien God [Music] while sid meier was diving deep into those thought experiments activision published a licensed spin-off SIV without him because just three years made that much of a difference back during the late 90s tech boom but call to powers unique calling card as more science fiction with a timeline extending a game of sieve all the way into the year 3000 as you try to keep managing things on a dying earth this leads to much of the mid to late game play having you deal with a period of global warming investing in oil refineries and resorting to nuclear war creates the substandard tiles of cleanable pollution ignore them long enough and you'll trigger the earth to go haywire flooding and also freezing land if left unchecked like Alpha Centauri but not like a Sid Meier Civ game call to power fully commits to that flooding flavor text turning the tiles not into swamps but into straight actual water with the permanent destruction of coastal cities if they're caught in that path what's also uncommon is the idea that you are intended to play all the way through this and keep going past that point extensive future technologies that sure didn't predict smartphones or social media include speculative solutions from fair feasible fusion power to more fantasy like eco fascist AI mine bombs that instantly destroy the world's heaviest polluters to eventually culminate in the construction of a world wonder called the Gaia Project a network of weather controlling satellites that centuries after the climate's destruction will finally turn off those disaster effects and open up the opportunity to reseed the planet with forests and fertile land again though you are never getting those water tiles back and over the next couple years what also would never be won back again was pop culture's innocence and optimism in 2001 George W Bush announced that the US would not be implementing the Kyoto Protocol's citing concerns that the deal would hurt the US economy and political arguments over the veracity of what is more or less scientific fact were beginning to take hold questionable election results the terrorist attacks and ignored science post marked this ten-year trend of environmentalism being such a big theme in the mainstream family-friendly pop culture the best-selling video games would soon be more about terrorism or in crime than simulators and strategy games video games were now mainstream and made more accessible the 2001 version of civilization bumps the challenges of its easiest difficulty up quite a notch from the previous one including the mechanics behind the series standard inclusion of global warming once again researching industry and burning fossil fuel begins ticking a color-coded timer that first replaces land with pollution and then warms or freezes tiles based on their proximity from the equator but the time it takes to trigger this effect and the lasting damage it causes are far less of a problem than in the previous games this time the ice caps require far more heat to melt down and also in civil for labour can be automated you don't have to use your precious settler units to pave paradise and then clean up the pollution that's a job for cheaper worker units who've got a button you can set and forget to make them do all the tough decisions for you you barely even have to think about it and in order to trigger global warming I actually had to go out of my way to deliberately tell them to stop you can just kind of tap turn after turn and then watch the game save the environment by itself the problem almost feels more like an annoying bit of flavor aesthetics than a meaty mechanical system with strategic outcomes your brain is thinking through three turns ahead of time and as the political culture changed so too did popular culture and so too did gaming culture 2002 was when you started hearing global warming be referred to as climate change after Republican consultant Frank Luntz pushed for a change in terminology that the Bush administration adopted while global warming has catastrophic connotations attached to it he wrote climate change suggests a more controllable and less emotional challenge despite more and more record-setting heat waves and hurricanes the problems prominence and strategy games follow that advice of becoming a less emotionally intense challenge jumping forward to sieve four in 2005 and we see it abstract all the effects of climate change down to just one desert vacation this is a very different much simpler and more random mechanic that instantly turns land squares into deserts in the late game regardless of what technology or buildings you're committed to clean sustainable energy does nothing to stop it and pollution is abstracted into healthiness which doesn't directly impact the environment you're looking at with your eyeballs instead it's plugged into the population and productivity formulas and later expansions global warming is held off for nuclear weapons in particular but that is a far cry from representing the decisions that cause it to happen in real life the feedback in control you have over it takes a noticeable step back even from Civ 3 and reviews and forum discussion began regarding the global warming mechanics with contempt as more of an annoyance than an interesting way to make the in gameplay and feel different from the early game while also plugging the players brain into thinking harder about current events these discussions and changes accompanied the increasing amount of denial over the issue though it's in the game it feels begrudgingly included in Civ for a mainstream big-budget strategy game with gameplay that more faithfully explores global warming was no longer something that could be taken for granted instead it was a big news story carrying controversy and corporate sponsorship from the companies who would have been the bad guys in the 90s games the SimCity series has always gamified the issues of air quality and solid waste management in 2007 SimCity society's flavors those problems as the result of global warming this one's called society's because the scale is significantly smaller more like a town builder than a city builder with currencies and formulas that emulate the need to fulfill your sims's emotional well-being and this results in a kind of strange game logic that didn't really stick with the fans or reviewers power facilities are each given a carbon rating and a happiness penalty so plopping down the super oil plant in the middle of a classy residential block results in unhappiness first before then rolling into the chain of consequences that links low property value to higher crime while a higher carbon rating increases the probability of triggering a selection of climate-related disasters droughts tsunamis and even climate refugees migrating from uninhabitable hot regions do create some interesting decisions to make particularly those refugees SimCity society's sides on the easier sector of the spectrum than similar sim cities but - the others housing is priced at a bit of a premium in this one and it also includes extra cost that pull from the whole emotional well-being side of the gameplay so the arrival of just 11 unexpected new residents can give you a lot of hard decisions to make creating a little bit of a crisis as usual these effects can be mitigated by unlocking and then plopping down cleaner energy options brought to you by the British oil barons that pissed off the Persians are your Sims living in a society that restricts their job choices down to ones that lower their life spans and property values than the british petroleum natural gas facility or the british petroleum hydrogen plant or the british petroleum solar farm are the solutions for you eventually leading to a reward building the british petroleum carbon exchange which isn't a power facility but rather an office tower that rewards you with straight cash for maintaining a low carbon footprint but where does that cash come from where do those climate refugees come from your carbon footprint is mostly invisible it's just a number something about the abstraction here strikes me is more disingenuous than the experience of watching those resources move as tangible game tokens across international borders in the grander scale of the sieve games but in 2010 sieve 5 released with no global warming mechanics at all the 2010s were a decade where games the tackle climate change were mostly relegated to the sidelines of obscure indie serious games projects developers selling games with money on the line tended to steer away from this topic there's only a small handful of exceptional cases in 2011 we got odd no 2070 a sequel to a series of historical city builders that are famously chill and relaxing but this kind of post-apocalyptic future one features a campaign that has you frantically shuffling around the world's few remaining resources for oil barons who ignore scientists warning them not to dig too deep into greedily but the meat and potatoes is the more peaceful continuous unwinnable sandbox mode where you slowly explore the intersection of buildings and units and infrastructure that eventually lead to satisfying moments of sitting back and watching the splendor of a fully functioning economy churn learning those systems you grappling with a kind of fantastical version of climate politics that provides the flavor for nearly every major decision of gameplay 50 years of flooding created continental archipelagos that are mysteriously lacking and ruins or survivors yet mysteriously abundant with sea life those five decades destabilized the world's governments enough to reduce all of their authority down to a single world council that tries to regulate some kind of low threshold of violence between the two remaining factions of industrialists who control everyone else the eCos who build cities with sustainable green technology and the tycoons who don't this manifests into two play styles depending on how you like your difficulty curve steep fast and unpredictable with the tycoons or a slower steadier climb with the eCos no matter which side you pick burning fossil fuels is gonna be an option on the menu too much of that and your robotic automatic hydroponic feature Farms will slow down their production as well as their population one interesting dimension here is that residents from both ideological persuasions have different tolerances for pollution and different ways of exploiting the productivity of your supply chains the optimal strategy is to hit a perfect ecological balance while still attracting the business of those tycoons but either way the buildable terrain you're given at the start is still gonna be there and more or less the same conditions by the time you're done the climate change flavoring here feels like a flavor instead of mechanics because despite jumping into the deep end of a futurist global warming scenario anno 2070 doesn't exactly risk a hard splash into that the two factions don't play fundamentally different from each other and the endless industrial growth that both play styles require are gonna force you into deforesting and paving over these islands to little actual consequence you don't risk dramatically reading the planet as in a far future Civ game or Oxford University's contribution to the serious games initiative it's a 2011 release with the ecological ethos of the 90s and the prophetic vision to have your first few levels of disaster management Fiasco's take place in 2020 using terminology from the United Nations and climate data from Oxford's own research makes for a game with mind-boggling ly heavy implications executed with alarmingly simple gameplay pick a scenario note the wind states and then play a hand of cards that represent all sorts of multi-year long multi-million dollar nationwide campaigns from lobbying for cap and trade policies to participating an election meddling to funding mass education to blackops2 transportation reform to spreading disinformation then press a button time fast forwards five years and a small selection of news headlines tells you what you did the sobering reality checks come from realizing that you can't solve all the world's problems and a lot of your strategy is going to come from preparing to turns ahead of time for the problematic results of solutions you employed five years ago the fate of the world does not look bright entire consequences can come from a lot of good intentions and the tutorial took me like a good five retries to get right prioritize a green energy awareness campaign during an insurgency and the responsive anger from spurned rebels can set things back worse than when you started oh god oh god we're just screwed ardently as an educational game about the real-life complexity behind the world's problems it's actually pretty effective and elegant the data and informational text and decisions can take you minutes to think over the first time but the results of each move come in quick and snappy with just one click the high difficulty curve driven by unexpected results and increasingly faster reach rise encourages a trial and error play style that makes it not just a hard puzzle game to put down but also one that taps into the idea that these policy decisions really matter and alternative futures are possible you are supposed to learn from the failures that cause disasters so that you can employ better policies next time that game was made almost 10 years ago and it's very sobering to imagine how differently the world could have gone over the decades since in any case global warming still remained an unpopular theme total war or employed a global cooling system for an installment depicting the fall of the late Roman Empire but the next sieve game in line a kind of spiritual successor to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri didn't feature any of the climate play of that old game all in 2015 Obama signed the u.s. to the Paris climate agreement and then in 2016 Trump withdrew the u.s. from the Paris climate agreement which was also yet again the Earth's hottest every year on record since record-keeping began in 1880 meanwhile the next sieve sequel in line sieve six released once again without any global warming mechanics at all a very indirect quote from a reporter hanging around at the launch party noted that Sid Meier did briefly mention some kind of effort to avoid taking position on controversial issues because apparently depicting a game about the problems facing the world of the future and one of those problems being more or less a scientific fact is a controversial political issue but this situation reverses civ will eventually tackle climate change again in a big way while in real life starts hitting the fan big time in 2018 a climate themed indie game jam precedes a number of releases that point at a shifting tide the multiplayer minecraft like eco bills itself as the tragedy of the Commons the game with your exploitation of the natural environment leading down a more industrial path than Minecrafts that generates pollution and prompts multiplayer servers into agreeing on laws that mitigate those built-in disasters is you mull over really extensive graph showing you just how where when and why any of your actions would have started screwing things up for everybody else Malloy industria an Italian web game developer that bills itself as a radical games against the tyranny of entertainment released like Kenya a far future post post post apocalyptic climate management focused city builder where ambiguous glitchy isometric tiles belie intriguing flavor text about far future civilizations cracking into mine shafts to discover veins of fossilized plastic water bottles this game's interpretation of the god game concept has you witnessing this all play out on a geologic timescale each tile of resources you plop down results in a rapid-fire time-lapse of centuries of environmental changes oftentimes to unexpected results my instinctive reaction was to plop some ice down to try and freeze up this water and shrink the coastlines back and L waited actually just melted it and added more plop down some solid ground instead and you might accidentally slide a fault line around and watch entirely new mountains and valleys form in a second plop city buildings down and most the time they will instantly become ancient ruins until you figure out more of a sustenance farming sort of situation that will keep these two meters representing environmental strength and human productivity in some kind of balance of each other the last stop on my list here is believe it or not the last big stop the sieve franchise made an entire expansion pack got themed around the idea of managing environmental issues which marks a definite turn away from the kind of apprehension shown during the game's original release party three years earlier Gathering Storm is the hardest Sid Meier has tackled global warming since Alpha Centauri once men use of fossil fuel selections start popping up you'll be tracking an extensive ice cap melt on terror that outlines exactly what sort of terrible consequences everyone's in store for and a lot of it is gonna be coming in from the other superpowers who can be pouring out far more carbon than the rest of you guys zullo's once the flooding starts your cities might find themselves wasting decades of the municipal production budget on giant coastal flood barriers that require huge resources and time budgets comparable to having to build a Great Wall of China around every continents coastline meanwhile the permanently flooded tiles don't just disappear all your hard work underwater but rather keep the tips of your destroyed construction poking above the waves to remind you of your failures till the end of time a more extensive future scenario is explored to envision a few ways out of this mess one option includes Bioshock style seasteading habitats that are played entirely straight and it is possible to avoid getting into the mess in the first place by steering clear of fossil fuels when it comes time to hook your cities up to a power grid but unlike the more eco conscious games of the 90s Gathering Storm still doesn't have the heart to permanently destroy the city centers you've been working on for centuries oh boy the island nations are gonna be doing wave better here than in the real life furthermore all the information and variables that it gives you in the interface kind and knock out the shock of unforeseen consequences that I do think is kind of important for gamifying this tragedy of the Commons the information provided is so extensive so early on that your Neolithic settlers from 6,000 years ago apparently have the foresight to know which coastal lands will be flooding first seventy generations later since the a eyes agendas can start out very eco conscious before those stakes are supposed to be fully known you might see the competing SIVs beeline straight towards nuclear power right after they invent the light bulb so whether global warming gets triggered at all is kind of a dice roll depending on who you have to play the game with if you happen to play a game where the environmentalist Maori are gonna be maintaining a top three spot you're likely to never encounter the problem at all but now that we're at this point in the timeline the future is very uncertain and the Backstreet Boys reunion tour has muddied any coherent vision of the future irreversibly uncertain times have produced greatly provocative works of science fiction in the past but when putting together this list I'm a little worried at how the big budgets the big video games have seemed to show them opting out of that step over the past twenty years I hate to end on an uncertain inconclusive note like this but that is the national mood this video was being written under and I hope that it at least gave you something that'll help mentally prepare you for the times ahead because as we head into even more uncertain times there aren't many more reassuring ways to relax than by getting a bit
