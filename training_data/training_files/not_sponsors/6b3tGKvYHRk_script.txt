it doesn't happen often but every once in a while a sponsor will approach us to do a video for them we'll deliver it and they will absolutely hate it and refuse to pay usually those videos end up lost in the archives forever never to see the light of day but today is a special day because Doppler labs makers of the here won and the agency that actually contracted us to do this video you're about to watch both either completely went out of business or got acquired by some other controlling interest so then without further ado I present to you band commercials from the archives [Music] protected IP check it out today through the link below okay so here's the problem it is impossible to get anything done in here I put up this sign but the only effect it seems to have is that instead of people walking right in they kind of point it the sine-wave at me and then walk right in anyhow so clearly something has to be done here [Music] okay so now we've got earphones in so this this is the isolation zone okay so constructions done now the last thing that's left then is to get third-party independent validation of my do not disturb zone so Dennis you're first I'll just summarize so what we've done is we've added light blocking material to the windows we've added an acoustic dampening material above the ceiling tiles in the room to prevent sound bleeding and sound reflections and around the monitor itself we've added a foil blinder but the one piece that we didn't you know really have to install is these so these are the Doppler labs here one noise cancelling earphones I think this sound might still be the issue as you only put the thing on the ceiling by the doors you can hear some stuff like I can already hear my own just talking it sounds like something is happening up there or not happening as a word so I'm optimistic okay yeah if I think this set up of all this stuff that you put around randomly in your office is going to work ya know [Music] so Dennis I'm just talking from like right kind of next to on the other side how would you describe the isolation no I can't hear you it sounds about the same it sounds about the same thing here yeah I hear more things okay now point back in here okay Dennis how's the isolation I can't steer here you you can still hear me okay well I can hear you less cuz you're outside it sounds like there's a wall between the two of us did you turn it on yeah would you do would you say the results are kind of disappointing all that's fine because this is the kind of the haha moment the last ingredient of the whole solution is actually the most important in my hand here rare earth magnets what these are are incredibly strong magnets here try it try and peel it off see anyway they're really strong magnets oh yeah so they're definitely rare earth magnets by positioning them around you I should be able to have an effect on what you hear okay what I'm serious is it because the magnetic field thing I'm gonna put one of them here one of them goes behind the monitor but out of your line of sight can you see this I can okay how about now no I can't okay if I talk like this do you hear any difference I don't know if I can tell nothing okay check the angle here okay I'm gonna put it right here the last one is the one behind your head so if I were to move behind your head do you hear a difference holy wait do you like do you hear a difference okay hold on okay hold on just a second is that better or worse worse okay uh yeah it sounds like the ambient noise as you did that really went down the wall so I'm moving closer towards you I'm moving closer towards you and now I'm touching the back of your head can you hear it yes oh wow I feel like I can't hear you like budge I'm bringing it back around it's quiet again and very quiet now oh wow is it working okay hold on a second I'm gonna move it away from your head okay I'm moving it around in front can you can you hear me better or worse okay I'm gonna move it back around your head oh [Music] yeah what if I told you that the magnets for both know what the whole way no it actually works cute what's actually happening is I am turning the real world up and down with the headphones I can even amplify it can you hear me even louder too much okay okay so that's more comfortable - 22 dB so basically in real time these things listen to the world around you and they change what you hear it actually has a microphone on the outside a DSP so digital signal processor or sound processor and then it has balanced armature drivers inside so what it's doing is it's actually taking the world around you altering it or removing or adding so you hear that right now and then re broadcasting it into your ears holy so you can actually even do like live EQ so I could I could add a bunch of bass they've got balanced armature drivers and instead of working like a traditional noise cancellation which would block out or create sound waves that cancel the waves around you what they're doing is they're basically sealing up as well as they can they're a closed design close back design and they're trying to block out everything and then they're actually re adding selectively that's really cool I thought but I thought it Becnel be cool it I thought you can do like magic change but okay that's cool that's pretty impressive I feel like being able to turn now the real world would be that would be extremely extremely useful in a lot of circumstances very cool technology cuz like and also the fact that like something like this isn't really big and ugly is surprising where like it actually has the ability to like cut out so much noise around you and it's taking in all the sound that you it hears and then just giving it to in almost real-time basically I could D tell a difference I know so essentially real-time no that's very cool so what they ultimately didn't like about the video was the way that we positioned the here.one as a really cool piece of tech and it really is it works way better than you'd probably expect but one that wasn't ready to go toe-to-toe with Apple's air pods and I can see why because clearly they were so strapped for cash that they weren't going to survive if this one wasn't a huge commercial success but it looks like we were right so there you go the more at the link in the video description so thanks for watching this video guys if you disliked it you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff that we featured at the link in the hahaha no you can't do that what is linked in the video description though is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join and right now I'm going to adjust my angle to Dennis's camera angle so that I appear to be sitting straight tennis one job man one job pulled the camera no no
