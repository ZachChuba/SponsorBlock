over the last couple of videos with Martin Hilmer I've decided today that I'm looking for a bit more solitude I have to feel that in September as the autumn kicks in the summer holidays and the kids have gone back to school you spend lots of time with lots of people so I'm looking for a bit of solitude generally when September hits and today and I've come to find that I've come here to divock water in the Lake District it's a really isolated little spot and hardly anybody here at all I've seen about two people so far and I've been here for a few hours so I'm getting exactly what I want you may have seen the little boathouse in the introduction there I'm going to try and figure out how to put that into an image I'm not shot here before but I want to get that into a nice image somehow after that I'm gonna try and find another shot before I head home I've got a flask of coffee as well I'm gonna sit enjoy these beautiful surroundings for a little while yes so let's get side I need to try and find a slightly different place to shoot this boathouse that's behind you here but because I'm not quite happy with where I'm at the mums I'm gonna go around maybe shoot it from the side and do something with long exposure so let's go okay so I'm set up for the first shot and I've come around to the side of the boat house because I think it just provides a much better composition than shooting it head out head on head on is quite nice because you've then got that hill behind you but I just think is the composition as a whole it's gonna be nicer shooting it from the side now I have composed already and I've got the boathouse right down in the bottom right-hand corner of the image and I'm using the water and the sky almost like negative space to put all of focus down onto the boathouse and I think that's gonna be quite a nice way to show that man-made structure in this quite vast natural environment and the kind of work really well together to further exaggerate that feeling though I'm going to use long exposure and I want really long exposure an extreme long exposure if you will so I'm going to use at 16 stop filter on the front of the 24 to 17 mil lens I'm in at about 45 millimetres to get the composition that I want I don't really have anything in the foreground other than the water but then like I said the Bott house is just really low in the image I've then got the hills and those interesting clouds that are going to blend together into a nice ethereal feel I might give it a black and white treatment or I might just desaturate a little bit give it that nice smooth sort of parsley like feeling that's kind of that's what I'm sensing while I'm here so long exposure photography extreme long exposure photography can be quite difficult sometimes I find it's really helpful just to get a workflow together and to do that the first thing you need to do is take the image as if you were doing it just as a normal exposure for this one settings wise I'm at f/8 one sixtieth of a second and ISO 100 that is your base exposure that you're then going to calculate to get your exposure depending on which ND filter you're going to put on I'm putting a 16 stop ND filter on so I'm going to take my phone out of my pocket and launch the photo pills app and I'm just gonna pop in f/8 on sixtieth of a second ISO 100 that's probably gonna be too long yet 18 minutes and 12 seconds I definitely don't want that so I'm gonna probably about 400 yeah 400 iso 400 gives me a four minute 33 second exposure which is just about right with a 16 stop filter on the front with the Canon 5d Mark 4 that is going to be absolutely fine couple of problems that I've got firstly is the Sun is coming and going and I really don't want too much sunlight in this image if I'm lucky and it has been doing this I'll get cloud for the vast majority of the time that it's exposing then with just a little bit of sunlight popping through just to light up the sort of front or the left-hand side is we looking at it the front of the boat house which is looking directly at the Sun and that'll just give it a nice contrast against the darkest shadowy wall that's facing us here and I really want that to happen it might then light up the roof a little bit as well and just make the boathouse stand out a little bit more from from the from the background and we can do things in post-processing to make that happen as well right so once we've got the exposure put into the camera I need to switch into build mode and then you need to have an intervalometer this Canon 5d Mark four has one built in I've already put four minutes 33 seconds in there then it's just a case of covering your viewfinder if you're using a DSLR if you're using mirrorless you don't need to worry about that but then just need to pop our filter on the front make sure you have locked it off in manual focus for this shot I've just focused right in on the Boathouse because that is the main part of the image it's focused switch into manual turn your stabilizer off as well if your lens has one then just attach the the filter to the front I screw in filters just because I prefer it but you might have a filter system that you can easily add it in just screw it on very simply and then we are ready to shoot so let's go ahead and expose that now right Sebastian let's just have a little look at that yeah that is looking really nice just straight out the camera it's looking good has already those and a passively Blues in it nice smooth water as well and I was quite fortunate Anderson did come out just for about 30 seconds to light up a boathouse oh I've got a nice contrast on that side wall as I had planned so yeah really really happy with that I'm looking forward to getting home and post-processing that [Music] how beautiful is this I found a lovely little spot for the sunset I can see my car just down there as well so it's nice and easy at the end of the day I've got a nice raised position Mountains behind me timelapse going and when the Sun dips just below that cloud line there between there and the horizon I am going to get some beautiful golden light they'll be just around the time the golden hour hits as well striking mountains behind me there I think there's going to be a couple of compositions that are gonna work really well I'm hoping this grassland will get filled up as well so yes I think it's gonna be great so I'm gonna take half an hour or so have a cup of coffee and a lot something to eat and just enjoy this moment it's a little bit windy it's not too cold just the lovely moments by myself with you of course come along feels good [Music] [Music] I'm very good that light is now looking beautiful the wind has died down as well and just a fantastic moment photography wise though it could be a little bit tricky there is only really one composition that I'm interested in at the moment there's probably quite a few compositions but and focus down on just one and that is the only thing I'm interested in right now and that is with the 70 to 200 millimeter lens on here I'm at about 100 millimetres at the moment I'm at 180th of a second f/8 because all my everything in my image is quite far away from me I'm at ISO 320 just to keep should speed up a little bit for the sake of this 17200 without the without the tripod neck on it so I'm composed in on the main mountain behind me there the one that's closest the big one that's close to me and as the Sun is dipping down below that cloud line I've now got it between them the hill and the cloud just casting some beautiful lights over there so down in the valley I have some nice trees green fields that goes up into a sort of Hill that's a bit closer to me covered in some beautiful autumnal grasses and dying ferns dying ferns actually close up they don't look too special a table in distance they look magical because as they die off they go a brownie ready or terminal color that just looks fantastic in the distance in the image and that's something I can really bring up in post-processing as well because as I'm stood here looking at this scene there is an absolutely awesome not feel to it and really if you just took a picture and didn't post-processing at all it would still be quite greeny yellowy because more yellow comes into that those greens as there as the winter gets closer but by just standing here the feeling of autumn is definitely there and that's what I will be putting into this image if it works if I get the light because I want the light to be hitting the peak of that mountain and at the moment it isn't so for my image to work I really need that because the top Mountain is capped with a little bit of cloud as well and if that was getting struck by the light I think it just could be a really really nice image very straightforward I mean like I said 100 millimetres mountainous plastic-like district scene that I keep talking about when I get this shot done though get it in the can hopefully it'll work if not it doesn't matter sit here and wait for the lights look how dark it is as well with this light on my face just gray evening [Music] this
