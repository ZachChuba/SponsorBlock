one of the biggest things happening here at the show is not necessarily a product per se but rather an initiative from Nvidia so what we're looking at right now is the a su Studio book which is one of 17 of what they're calling our TX Studio laptops in what appears to be a clear shot across the bow of Apple and the perception that MacBook Pros are the ideal portable computing device for creative professionals so what I'm looking at right here is one of their new super slim and super sexy Quadro r-tx 5000 notebook designs where they're showing off not just the performance but also the flexibility in terms of your workflow that real-time ray tracing along with their tensor cores and all their AI features enables so with a device like this instead of moving something into the scene and then waiting around for a render I can evaluate in real time how doing something like you know duplicating my couch here or like yeah there we go duplicating my couch affects the the lighting of the room here let's let's make a bunch of couches look at that ah oh that's awful we covered up our light with the couch surely that won't do let's move our couch over here no one's ever gonna hire me to design their room here not much is sure but with a laptop like this I could certainly try for our last demo here again with the obvious comparison we've got red cine X now this is something that's a little bit more applicable to us and the claim here is check this out decode debayer and color 6k red video on a notebook in real time now obviously we're not able to do that using CPU decoding on the MacBook you can see once we use up our buffer here the playback is simply not smooth by contrast the GeForce r-tx studio laptop using CUDA is able to handle it very comfortably now something that you guys might have noticed by this point in the video is that these studio notebooks are not obviously different from similar gaming models so what exactly is it that sets them well there's a couple of things one of them is that in some cases the specs have actually been tweaked so instead of a high refresh rate lower resolution panel you might end up with a higher resolution lower refresh rate one in this case we're looking at a 4k OLED panel on this arrow 15 OLED from gigabyte another thing actually comes down to drivers so instead of delivering like 20-plus game-ready drivers a year these studio or these creator optimized notebooks are expected to get somewhere in the neighborhood of five to seven that have been validated not just with professional applications but with professional workflows so this one right here is running Photoshop Maya and substance painter in this case all at the same time this is a Quadra 5000 model that they had task manager pulled up specifically to show that it is sucking up 15 point 4 gigs of GPU memory but anyway the idea is to make sure that these drivers are going to be stable not just with one application but with multiple ones running at once so that people's workflows aren't gonna get disrupted so we're not expecting these to come cheap particularly the Quadro 5000 based ones with the 16 gig frame buffer but what's clear is that if your work revolves around needing a powerful computer and you want to be able to be mobile this is about the most compelling option that we have ever seen speaking /l tt to save 10% today we're gonna have that linked below so thanks for watching guys if you dislike this video you can hit that button but if you liked it hit like get subscribed or maybe consider checking out where to buy the stuff we feed at the link in the video description also down there is our merch store which has cool shirts like this one and our community forum which you should totally join
