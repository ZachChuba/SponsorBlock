hello everybody and welcome back to a brand new video now this week i have another really interesting set of stories from runescape's history similar to the last video i'm going to be taking three or four interesting ideas or stories that wouldn't really fit into one video just call it a runescape variety piece now today i'm going to be looking at a couple of different stories uh primarily a really interesting one back from 2008 where players would actually kind of start a competition to see who could break the rules the most as at the time jagex offered somewhat of a currency for doing so those were called black marks and they're a very short-lived uh system to dole out punishments or maybe we're going to go back further to when runescape actually had captcha codes in the game not just a stupid suggestion you read on reddit they actually existed anyway guys i hope you enjoyed the video and let's get started now black marks is something i personally vaguely remember as i was playing at the time they existed sometime between 2006 and 2009 the exact start date is a little bit unknown but we do know that they were eventually removed may of 2009 now what were black marks well essentially they were a disciplinary measure used to kind of track how many offenses that players had certain offenses were worth more black marks certain ones were worth less minor infractions could be worth half a black mark and more major offenses could be worth multiple essentially if you manage to accumulate 10 black marks on your account your account could be permanently muted or banned now some black marks were able to be removed from your account if they were a minor in fraction but stuff like real world trading that stuff pretty much stuck forever and now possibly one of the mistakes with this whole system is they made the black marks viewable in your account settings which meant pretty much that you could see exactly how many black marks you have accumulated and because of that somewhat of a competition was born how many black marks could you accumulate on an account before it got banned now remember i mentioned earlier that at 10 black marks your account could be permanently muted or bad that doesn't necessarily mean that it would which means people manage to go well past the 10 black mark threshold now on top of players not necessarily just getting banned outright as soon as they hit 10 there's also some of a lag time between committing the offense and getting your account banned as the offenses had to be monitored tracked go through a queue someone had to manually review it and then apply the ban so between the times of committing the offense and the account getting banned you were able to stack up a ton of black marks on the account and there are some crazy accounts out there okay first up here we have a youtube video of a player having 38 black marks out of 10. the account was of course permanently banned and permanently muted but we can see all of their offenses and we can see that these ones were committed actually almost six months apart that this next player here had 100 black marks out of 10. definitely pretty high up there looks like most of their fences though were on the exact same day and that's how they managed to get such a high total and finally here we have by far the highest i've seen and that is 348 black marks out of 10. they literally have 30 times more black marks than should have taken to get banned again most of the offenses all took place on the exact same day i'm just kind of impressed that they managed to actually commit that many offenses in the single day what was this player doing now like i said eventually the system was disabled i think partly and due to the fact that players are abusing it like this and they think a punishment system where players are attempting to get banned is probably not doing a very good job now a feature that a lot of players have shown interest in and kind of been asking for for a long time is the ability to redo quests not for experience of course but either for the speed running community or just to be able to do them again and experience the story again now currently i think jagex is actually considering it but did you know that this feature actually has already existed in the game a long long time ago now back when runescape classic was transitioning to rs2 there was a beta and of course because it is a beta the whole point of it is to do testing and to make sure everything is working as intended now unfortunately one big limitation would be quest because you can only do them once and unfortunately a lot of players testing rs2 had already completed most of the quests in the game as they were some of the more dedicated members of the fan base and to get enough information to make sure the quests have been implemented properly really you needed to allow the beta testers to replay the quest otherwise you'd have to make a new account train it up and especially for those later game quests it just wouldn't really be feasible or reasonable to expect someone to do that now their solution at the time was actually to add in a temporary npc by the name of erasmus so temporary in fact that i could not even find a picture of him only briefly mentioned in some update notes back from march 9th of 2004 where they stated that they have temporarily added an npc by the name of erasmus who is northeast of the lumbridge castle you can speak to him and he will allow you to restart the legends quest the dragon slayer quest and the shiloh village quest now something that's kind of interesting to me is despite the fact that the update notes say that erasmus is located in lumbridge the wiki as well as a few other sources seem to indicate that he's actually located in the legends guild meaning that you needed to complete the legends quest to be able to restart your quest now these may seem kind of random but at the time these were actually the highest tier quests in the game because back then we only really had rune armor and these were kind of the end game quests at the time so if you had already completed legends quest dragon slayer or shallow village you could talk to this npc and they would let you redo it now erasmus was only in the game for around 20 days after that the full runescape release came on i think it's kind of interesting to me that we had a feature to replay quest about 15 years ago but that idea was never revisited i think it's probable that a feature like that hadn't been really tested for large amounts of people as it was only really intended for a beta test of a couple of different quests now captcha codes in runescape is something that gets tossed around a bit but mainly as a joke for example we can see here someone's suggesting that you have to enter a captcha code before every phase changes zorra it's not really considered to be a serious feature that people would actually like as i think most people realize that it would be extremely annoying and wouldn't be a very good anti-body measure to be honest as well but a lot of people may not remember that actually back in runescape classic there were legitimate capture codes in the game then to understand why these were implemented in the first place we need to kind of understand what kind of anti-body measures there were at the time so botting in runescape is something that goes back right to the beginning pretty much immediately after the game was released bots started to pop up by the end of 2002 bots have become a massive issue in the game so sometime in november they added in a new anti-botting system called the fatigue system essentially the way that it would work is that any activity that you completed in the game would increase your fatigue after a while you would eventually get to 100 fatigue and you no longer gain any resources or collect experience now initially the only way to get rid of your fatigue was to go asleep in a bed but those are kind of inconvenient so eventually jagex decided to implement a portable sleeping bag in 2003 now while this was a lot more convenient for players it was also well a lot more convenient for bots now to attempt to fix this jagex actually implemented a captcha code for whenever you wanted to use your sleeping bag i think this is so crazy to actually think that this existed and i don't think overall it was very successful not just based on what the captcha codes looked like at the time i'm pretty sure bots could still figure it out and not to mention that pretty much every single player would be affected by this bought or not so it wasn't really a good option now these captcha codes existed pretty much from mid 2003 all the way until the release of rs2 where we got the random event system which overall i think it was a lot better and a little bit less intrusive not to mention this capture code here that actually told you to type in fatty definitely kind of brought you out to the moment a bit so the random events were definitely better anyway guys that's gonna be it for today's video i hope you guys enjoyed it if you have any other interesting runescape history things you want me to talk about leave a comment down below i always appreciate it now before i go here i anyway thanks for watching guys and i'll see you next time
