enough for me la I'm not that big of a guy yeah turns out that was wrong that was a lie get like a ramp rigged up I strap on my four-wheeler it's big strap coming around ramp for wheelchairs pardon you should know perfume in there yeah yeah this morning one with your video tap it up dab dab dab it down perfume Ethan this is Ethan's brand new Honda one piece of dirt on it we're gonna change that today oh so cool good oh that is quick yeah that's pretty cool that's simply the new 2020 design I guess mine does look cooler though yeah you always gotta be the one always get the last word in Joe someone's good that was graceful right right I was just giving the last word yep yeah okay [Music] [Music] [Music] those pretty deep as you can see machines having a hard time not not too happy with it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] all right we had a little snafu kind of on a touch of an angle here if you couldn't tell we got to get it out we got the winch up to this tree here [Music] oh that's cool what happened there that's not good what is going on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] well we've been my batteries both died but we've been forwarding it all in this fresh powder in the forest really cool I don't know where we're like man you could probably come back in here and camp never see anybody for days let me round the bend look what we find an old cabin no one's been here this big old branch fell down could have took the cabin out but it doesn't look like it even hit it by the snow on there and I could happen before I guess but it's all locked up I'm not gonna try to get in there too much but it's pretty cool man we found an abandoned cabin there's all she'd show you this there's stickers on the front of this of the cabin there's a permit and the latest one is from 1997 the earliest one stems back to the 70s so I'm not gonna show cuz there's a guy's name on there but 7997 72 there's four permits on their latest is 97 I assume no one's been here in a long time there's even a booth there's an ood who's Ethan [Music] [Music] yeah we found a leg look at that it looks pretty awesome too there's a lot of those that's really cool we didn't know where we were going have a look at the map or the GPS at all just been driving very cool okay I was wrong this is fine you can step on this you do a power slide no I see a power slide we'll do a power slide I wasn't it yeah man it's not even December yet and we're walking on this this is solid solid I don't know about the middle but this is definitely solid I wouldn't be over here doing this if it one power slide my knees hurts so bad I'm 35 years old did it look cool though or it didn't seem cool very big lake I can see the whole thing unless it hooks are on the side here where there's definite camping possibilities all around here we could next year we could um you can both get racks for our quads put the pac boats on top of the quads the boot down here or wherever around tons of places around to do that and then go back in for as long as you want sure this is taka fish be awesome man this tool well I felt that was cooler than the well it's uh we didn't know we were gonna make you here we don't even know where here is what it's cool to make it to a destination as opposed to just turning around the middle of the trail and going back but it's three o'clock now probably got a good hour to our ride we packed down the snow so maybe just an hour ride back to the truck mmm we'll go true yeah we'll go maybe take some side trails and see other things and get back to the truck around 5:00 it'd be dark we'll go back to the camp I got sausages and potatoes garlic onions type of thing for dinner it's not alright guys we will touch back up with you either at the camp or at the truck or something cool happens if we see a Lynx or a SAM scratch all right well we're back with the trucks some craziness happened the but four-wheeler broke like clanking sound against the plastic when it runs and no I can't it won't go right I put it in too high I put it in the low put in Reverse nothing I hate the river they hit the the throttle and it revs but nothing happens it doesn't move like a rod shoved through the side of the block but I mean there wasn't that much oil and it still runs it just sounds like crap but it won't do won't move right that's the problem so Eddie get us to uh Ethan told me Odin and his Honda I think goodness we were closed off the highway now we rigged this up if the thought of this - I would not have I totally admit I would never have thought of this to get it up into my truck now because it doesn't move and we can't he can't pull me up there we've got a tow rope attached underneath here and then again on the other side and then the winch hooked up to that I'm gonna hopefully winch myself up and then tomorrow when I get home I'm gonna take this thing right into the dealership and mm-hmm give them a piece of my mind it shouldn't happen I this is less than a year old I have less than 500 miles on it like it's ridiculous anyway I'm gonna get this up here now or try to all right listen to the lovely sound when I turn it on [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] neutral is it with one hand they gotta let go the okay push me up in please oh my goodness what a pile of crap I am not pleased sure my last videos pretty happy with it womp womp womp mother truck and womp [Applause] we're back now I really am thankful to Ethan and his very good idea about winching that four-wheeler up on top of there I would have never thought about doing that myself I knew about winching but I would never have known how to connect it I probably went from the front and scratched my truck all up like crazy anyway very happy that he had that idea we're back now at the camp you gotta get a bunch of firewood cuz we are so hungry to get supper going before I do that then I'm gonna snack into another epic bar before I go out and spend a bunch of energy trying to collect a bunch of wood I need get some energy first watch out that now we got this one dead tree here and that'll be enough for the whole night for us decent size around it breaks off into two pieces at the top I never have that much success perfect this perfect spell it's a perfect fill I'm so glad you said pill it didn't touch any other oh just miss tell you every single time I do that it gets hung up and have to thread the bottom and walk it up all this bullish anyway done new resinous - Reza no sir axé no stop totally fine yeah let's operator errors nothing rose well at least you didn't break your four-wheeler okay I think we've got enough firewood now got most of that pine broken up too we are starving it's about to get dark just after 5:00 no I'm gone all day lots of uneventful or lots of eventful things happened unfortunately I would have liked a nice uneventful ride but I think I'm gonna get rid of that that quad I have nothing but problems of it lately especially after that last video I like it pretty good nothing ever went bad on it so that's good but I'm sure that problem is still under warranty as it has complete to do with the it's all to do with the motor so I'm sure it'll be fine but they'll get fixed and get a different one sell it and get a different one we'll see I really have had a lot of problems with it lately before that it was even not want to see him ski started what do you want you want to fry those sausages in that cast iron okay cool and then I got rice we can put on to one club in the only the best Uncle Ben's open ah they're selling Eddie Guerrero Oh hmmm no sizzle no sizzle I can't do it can't do it yeah says it for the camera what's up for the camera on top of the camera oh I don't know and I can't see sure yeah good all right I don't put these sausages I'm sure we'll get a sizzle oh how many you can eat two or three three more pork information I still got some rice we'll put on later all right these have a couple courses to course rice and sausage me man it's warm in here no yes all right sausage me up big boy ok you want I'll have to whatever the right here done this once the done this really pretty drawn on one side dundies thank you I'm sure you got rice oh you're like three grains of rice fulfill let's go right you need mustard bring muster didn't in fact bring mustard hmm that's disappointing listen bucko oh man well we were out there five or six hours today I feel accomplished enough tired enough you know we were out there on that fix know you're not just easing along on the four-wheeler it's a lot of work rocking it back for us jumping back up and down didn't pulled out of ditches and what one day on that week so part of this I wanted to map this out for for the fall for summer next year and come in like I said earlier a rack on my boat or my canoe on my four-wheeler put the boat on there and get back into any of these lakes and I don't have to stay at one I hip-hop from Lake to Lake there's just networks of ATV trails back in here like crazy doesn't stop very cool yeah so yeah very accomplished good day fun day I wished that my four-wheeler didn't break you know be honest with you I'm really hoping hoping hits under warranty but either way things happened while I wasn't bought myself because I wouldn't got it out if I had to leave and come back with someone I'm like two hours away from the poem here not to mention the fact you set was supposed to snow today or tomorrow anyway oh well very impressed with Ethan's Honda never even gave Honda considered Honda yonder a consideration before but we got a thing even with the stock cars cruising all right we'll finish this up hope for a bit go back with you all right guys I think that's it for the video we're sitting here for a few hours now all full on rice and sausages yeah we head into bed but this is it for the video all we're gonna do

guys enjoyed the video sorry I didn't get a little bit more footage of the quadding my both our cameras crapped out our GoPros it was so cold yeah my battery died quick and then the wind guess I think
