[Music] hi everyone welcome back to my channel I'm so excited for today's video because I have been wanting to renovate the downstairs half bath since we moved here a year ago we had our home built and although the bathrooms are nice I wanted to change it up to my style it is finally complete and how to share it with you all if you're renovating your bathrooms as well I hope this gives you inspiration and you can take something from this I changed all of the builders hardware the faucet mirror and lighting and it gave the bathroom a completely different look without breaking the bank I wanted to keep it budget-friendly because things can get pricey so I purchased things from all of my favorite stores and I'm going to share with you what I did to save money on the lighting that inspired this entire bathroom makeover [Music] video now let's go ahead and get into the DIY bathroom makeover I've missed you guys and I appreciate the messages and comments letting me know you missed me too and are thinking of me as well I wanted to take a break and enjoy the time with my family because you can't get time back my husband was on vacation then we had family visiting from out of the country it was my birthday month and the knew was my baby's first year birthday so we have been soaking in all of these wonderful moments in our lives I will be sharing where I purchased everything from starting off with this chrome toilet paper holder I got it at the Home Depot I really like this one because I can lift the bar up instead of taking the entire bar out which I'll show you later on in the video the towel ring is from Home Depot as well and the switch covers they had an all me recover instead which is really nice as well but I love the extra detail these have next I purchased the bath mats from home goods as well as the soap dispenser the big bath mat is $14.99 and the smaller one is $9.99 [Music] this acrylic sub dispenser was $12.99 one of my favorite purchases I made for this bathroom was the mirror that I found from home goods for such an incredible deal you guys it was marked down to $45 from $100 and they said it's been there since October so since nobody bought it they marked it even more after so long so make sure you always check your clearance section for those amazing deals here's some clips of my husband working on all the changes we wanted starting off he's painting and this color will be in the description box if you're interested in it I wanted to make sure that this color was light and neutral because the space is small and it made such a beautiful difference I never knew how all the towel rings were installed so seeing my husband take the towel ring off was a learning experience for me and it's super easy to give your bathroom a glam update on a budget we picked out the pewter color in the house details but I never like the accessories the builder gave us for the bathrooms so I knew they had to go when the time came and this was very affordable to upgrade [Music] little details like this makes such a huge difference as you can see this is a miter saw we used to make all the wood cuts we wanted crown molding and wainscoting in here because the bathroom felt really boring and even though we have high ceilings it felt like a space wasn't to its full potential having walls without crown molding this detail takes the room to another level my husband has installed all of this by himself he has done all the crown molding and wainscoting in the kitchen living room baby's room and hallway for now it can get pricey so we've tackled one room at a time [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] here's one more recap of how the bathroom looked before [Music] and here's the after [Music] [Music] I'm so so happy with how this guest bathroom turned out I want to thank my husband for such an incredible job on all of the hard work to make this possible this is exactly how I envisioned this small space to turn now but it turned out even better even though it's a small half bath downstairs it definitely brings the wow factor and that's what I was going for [Music] I'm so happy I went with this sliding because it's absolutely stunning the crystals are high-quality and I love the way it made the entire room come together [Music] the most expensive part for this renovation was all the wood we bought from Lowe's for the crown molding and wainscoting it was definitely well worth it because it adds value to our home and we love the outcome that's a win-win I purchased some additional decor for the bathroom and I shot my home as well the white wooden shelf was a DIY it was originally beige and gold but I painted it white it was in my baby's closet sitting on the floor because I had bought a canopy to read books with her under it and I didn't have a place for it anymore so I knew this would be the perfect spot for it [Music] this white trees recent purchase from home goods as soon as I saw anew would be perfect for this little corner I was going to put a nesting table here so I may switch it out when I find the right one but for now this works [Music] the bottom of the bass is really nice see calorie has a very similar tree to this one and it's a couple hundred dollars so this was a nice fine for $79.99 here's how the bath mats look they're very comfortable and I'm gonna be changing the floors later on so I will be showing you guys an update on that here's the new toilet paper holder and I'm going to show you how it comes up which is really convenient it just lifts up and there you go here's the trashcan I have in the corner it's the DIY I did a year ago with real wood and I'm gonna have the link to in the description box if you're interested in how to make it the new covers look so elegant and I love the chrome look this is the results to the rest of the pieces we are so happy with [Music] [Music] these towels are from home goods I've had them for about a year now I had them upstairs in my other guest bathroom but I recently saw them on my store server interested in them make sure to check your stores this Wallflower fragrance is from Bath & Body Works it was a gift for my birthday and it's the perfect spot for it [Music] the faucet is by the brand Delta and I purchased it from Home Depot I really like how tall it is because the one I had before it was very short that my hands would touch the bottom of the sink sometimes I'll be picking out different faucets for the upstairs bathrooms as well and I really look forward to sharing those with you guys the acrylic soap dispenser was a great find as well I like how simple it is but very elegant [Music] this flower arrangement was a recent find I found at Burlington for $14.99 I found two of these apothecary jars at HomeGoods they were $12.99 each and I store here my cotton balls and then q-tips on the upper shelf these hand towels were also purchased from home goods that I got for $6.99 [Music] [Music] this mosaic Mir wallah is from Ross that I've had for a couple years now I see it every so often come back in stores so keep your eye out this is a similar one to the one from Pier one
