I'm gonna fight your son he is lonely [Music] oh my god [Music] oh this contacts on her as well oh my god stop it okay I loved that time the song I freakin a lot I love retro funky music you know that you know that I love that kind of vibe and that was so perfect that was like seaside summer evenings retro we father's they loved it so much the real instruments and they're not either since but how they redid the opening part of the music with the electric guitar later on oh mama she as always looks tiny cause he loved the choreography but it's something you know it's gonna be iconic and those outfits in this MV sudden we could literally wear a paper bag and put it off but she called me ugly in every single language Under the Sun I'm not mad at that I mean she has a point if I met have I think I'd actually cry like I just stopped crying don't even just like happy tears but you know I speak intimidate I just cry I feel like I'm just so sorry that you have to like like be close to me I'm sorry nobody deserves that you know like step on me oh and then the MV the whole thing had a real it was very sudden me because suddenly has a quite distinctive tone and voice just quite a low raspy register but also destroyed like a wonder girls live which I love wonder girls so much so I did not hate that like I was so I love that I love that I love that but the Oviatt self was really well filmed as always and it wasn't anything particularly like crazy with the shots or anything but the aesthetic of it was really pretty I liked how this MV was focused on her and not necessarily like a storyline it was just like you know Sunmi having a good time with our girls Chinon crews it and relaxing but I really really love that is such a good start honestly these fellas these other songs better be good because so many bros up doing good stuff okay so next you've got horses come back Maria and I'm super super excited s+ as a solo debut is twit and you guys know I covered that I love that song so much and I just thought fast that she's cool and yeah Maria come back looks very interesting I can tell what direction it's gonna go in but because it's what's I you know it's gonna be like madder sexy vibes but yeah let's go huh sir Maria yes oh she a crime scene cuz it's a crown to look that beautiful oh oh well she's smoking that doobie kinda controversial but we high key Stan okay oh my heart I took it Oh [Music] oh it's very hard be okay go clean looking fine with the right attitude [Music] only pasta could pull off a fit like that Oh [Music] [Music] Gargi clean well I love this aesthetic that dad list of things also this that [Music] Oh Tech students I've never seen that straight line up for ships before this is very similar structurally to twist it's very different oh that's such a sick shop okay oh that's like their special face this month I'm very interesting I've never season others from a BW pull yes take your crown creaminess [Music] huh okay Kim Queen but what you got picked on a tina breakdown Wow she does spy with red hat but if you're interesting interesting [Music] I'll get my juice bombs oh she's just sorry charismatic man she pulls off silos Wow oh oh is that homegirls your friends oh wait ha ha ha idealize my gosh she's in a group oh my god the case again I loved that it's a complete different vibe to send me but I was still digging it okay we'll stop with this song I love that song like I said structurally and kind of beat wise it was a very similar to Twitter it was obviously sound a completely different but the structure was just the same which is nice it really suits her voice like her high register I loved how the user Harris if this one twit to me utilized a bit more of had a lower tone so this utilized to have falsetto to the max and I'm just so here Fred she just has the sexiest like growly voice you're gonna mean I'm so beautiful I really like those I did be good hard though the only bet that I'm a bit like huh is that like Latino breakdown I don't know if you did a little bit disjointed for me maybe after if you wanted since I'd be like okay okay but right now I'm just a bit like but I think the other less I was like a fact that it was really really sick for just in regards the entire song it seems a bit like disconnected for me but that's always something that me sick on me the MV was so interesting I don't think I've ever seen an RB WM feed like that like one us and mamamoo a BW artists there and these had be very outdoorsy and beautiful are pretty something dislike special effects based and like books it was very interesting like it was very new for our BW I've never known them to use graphics that much but that was so sick for cinematography point of view and of course you look stunning and every single for king scene only cost I could pull off that he joke isn't up what he see like it mattered because upon all the outfits of fire she looked fire I love her straightened hair I love her and a hair I loved every single part of her and her looks in this mV and I loved the MV like pure fire choreography we need to talk about that that first chorus break that with seams of the floor you know how I feel about floor workers I couldn't pick two words how I freakin shook I was like yeah and yeah I really really like that song okay next we have got dizzy you I feel like I'm saying that really really wrong but neither you are JYP the latest Japanese girl group I don't actually know a lot about newsy you I don't know any of the members for their names when jarppi announced he was going to be doing like the new zu program I didn't watch any of it I just kind of saw red and obviously in the stray kids MV I was happened those girls up to no end and then everybody in the comments like there's the nizzy project girls that was like your no way but the debut guest today would make cute happy and I'm super excited as you know they're like I want to see what JYP is bringing to the table with his Japanese girl groups certain Izzy you make you happy trending number 20 in the UK and I'm pretty sure it's high yesterday much act so let's go bang okay I'm sure everything's pass [Music] like a cute cute cute fairy chair Peetz that's a very lucky twice oh wow she's so pretty but this is twice as likely this is the treat twice is like wow that was some pretty man [Music] Wow rep the Epis man [Music] it sounds very JYP [Music] oh she's a good yeah my started up about that oh well she's so pretty my god [ __ ] me this so cute he's out the fires well the sometimes really gone anywhere know what I mean [Music] I'm waiting for it to like do something I mean she's such a develops that found only this sister says stop uh dumb okay guy oh that's so cool [Music] Oh digital but the same things all those pizzas are pretty Wow the fashion of this is on point hmm her voice is so shaped I've had it a lot Oh [Music] we don't think we jump in Gerber baby because I see them I see this is the most excited I've been about something in Python wow I'm really annoyed at the production so honestly this is so cute though and they were some really good [Music] huh boy this is a good she came up on Instagram all the time this card is super interesting as well Oh takes a long time to mature oh okay okay okay I'm very interested to see if that was their like official debut or if it was just like it kind of okay these are the girls here's a song because I'm gonna start with the song I'm gonna say I'm annoyed about the song that's the I would like to the positives they all sounded unreal or they've got some really really good worse than that da da ba ba da hang on it was a really cute song a really bumpy really bright I did really like this song it just went Nova and that's kind of annoying like it was the exact same time for the exact same energy all the way through and even the course and the veces there was no kind of like you know journey didn't go anywhere like that course I wrapped breakdown you know how I was like oh cause that wasn't the most that happened to the song and yet like they give you on the song even though I went nowhere we're still gonna keep me bubbly but I couldn't imagine myself listening to it cuz it just seems like the same thing over and over and over which isn't the ghost for the girls on fire like I said I don't know there's so much it's almost like looks like boring but it's just a bit like repetitive it didn't go anywhere which is so annoying but the side side the MV was super super cute you know how I feel about how happy cinematography if they'd have found elements of twice's like he in it they are just all really pretty girls also say it some of those things you can't watch stop smiling yourself like you're just like they are all stunning girls like I said and the opiates awful just really cute I love the picture like my god girl my god also a nice which I love the name drops they did they put it in four they put in who are they putting fancy they put an icy they put in I'm so hot by Wonder Girls and goodbye baby miss a I love that you know me I'm JYP triage so I appreciated that yeah I really like this honestly the girls seem really cute I really looking forward to seeing what else they do yes okay next we've got woods save Izzie who don't know what this was another singer and he was a member of x1 he was also a member of unique and he was also in Imola which is like a rock collective and the gym in official chip it together funny story when it comes to words alkalyn words i have fallen in love with him four different times different by woods and pool by woods i really really love you would have seen i should force my friends to watch them different it's probably one of my favorite one of my top army korean songs and i love that's all so much like that's him I also used to be really into unique and they have a son called like we was actually Kobe and his power was always my favorite I never went to Namsan suffered another names but his part was always my favorite bola I knew him from molar and I loved his voice as well and then when Proteus was announced I saw him was like whoa he's like fire and then I came to the realization that all four of these people were the same person that I was like god damn that's faith so I'm super super excited for this song which is Luffy hada hurricanes actually storm I just think he's got the most amazing voice and it's roofings unreal his tone is just super super nice and his songs have always got lyrics that just go right through you like different brother song goes through me and of course there aren't any subtitles for this so um we're gonna have to fill out okay so once I'm ready to fall in love again love me gonna miss key Oh acting King I'm pretty much at the dairy cool solenoid [Music] Oh [Music] what's better than 1/2 a while they understand shock and it's just a service if we were that matrix ich weiß Oh fine [Music] oh my god yes [Music] Wow what a little fire music going on my bra [Music] Oh [Music] oh my god is voice I love this robot oh [Music] it's just so much I bought it on business around [Music] [Applause] it's really the right bra Alicia oh this concept is very sick I want to say my opinion might go together [Music] [Music] I hope I mentioned that he's fine as hell how do you look like two completely different people brah guys do I see guys it's funky this song is so good oh we got the dollar dollar bills y'all oh shoot literally hey what's the war Mitch what's going on Uncle Jesse show oh geez oh you have no chill he wasn't hotter jumper since we really just didn't know that we can false alarm on that boy just Kim it why is it Allah fire music coming out okay that's really the quite separate in a reaction because I just wanted to sit and watch that and enjoy it that was fire they were sued another day isn't incredible vocalist and rapper and I feel like Woods was definitely more of his R&B persona and I thought that did make they've made one's a bit more kpop you know which is interesting but nonetheless he sounded fire I love this song it was funky he sounded incredible I love the drop in the chorus and then the kind of this I grew up in the core so you're like then the MV this was such an interesting concept which is another reason why I don't talk too much because my dumb dumb brain probably won't be able to connect the dots what's better than one words is two words says he looked in credible he looks so different between the two characters that at first I thought it was two different people I was like who's that the duality junkie the heck out and those outfits will fire the grow now head oh but everyone sorry I was so cool [ __ ] I cannot believe that is really when it's shot him for his money like come on we can't false alarm vibes but although I'd have to summarize my brain isn't working words are not forming I love that I love that I love every single part of that and it's in my playlist play at my funeral and the birth of my first child and my wedding and yeah any case the final some you've got is eyes one and I could just do this in because like I said at the beginning my end up is not reacting to this so I thought we just throw in at the end and I just give my thoughts and I have heard the song quite bad i watch the performance version I honestly don't know why I didn't react the performance version but I like this song I think it's really really good and yeah let's just go so final song is one of the secret story of this one oh okay oh wow stones do such good aesthetic [Music] okay it's tough it's a very eyes one aesthetic a second it's a little bit more hardcore satsang it's quite hard Wow [Music] how is one young sorry what you're gonna meet this so much prettier than I'll ever be oh I commented so much that I missed so many times that makeup is stunning Oh Queen the glitter the glitter is such a pretty sad man eyes one house have such like an elegant and pretty wide to them like what I think I want to think it's very pretty like who [Music] [Music] identity straight up at the choreography [Music] the color the sensory color base but that's very interesting that a mission to glitter an actual princess Wow the kids I brought so pretty so pretty go on Harry Potter oh this is interesting there's a very interesting colors they take for the likes that peach peach to this court we can say it's beautiful [Music] oh this was a very interesting [Music] Wow [Music] this story is fire [Music] there's just so many different comments but it also works so well Oh Cisco red hair and a peach outfit the field it's fire like wow oh so pretty man okay so obviously I can't say a lot about the song on that because I've had that song so many times but it's so powerful and she's a really good song I feel like when you this is one season to a song a lot of times you kind of forget how you first felt when you had it but the MV isn't that they I haven't seen before I'm so interesting this because when I first heard this song I obviously i think people imagined to me with darker more powerful vibe but the family stuck with their like colorful glittery princess vibe but it worked so well like I said I don't know but such a distinctive vibe to them it's very elegant and beautiful and this stuck with that and worked so well I compared to the song so when I kind of [ __ ] I'm so interested in how many different color schemes are wearing this but it works so well that they have so much glitter but it was like peachy but it was white and then it was like blue and there was yellow but like how did it work so well my brains actually frazzled how do they make that why the envy was really well fail area these are graphics and there's like it just has such a beautiful mystical elegant home like I said very eyes one like I think even if it wasn't bad if it was another group I'd be like that's an eyes on this that day sure and again the curvy eyes on Corey's are always so intense and intricate and I think the father Assemblymembers also helps their formations are bellissimo and this was no exception I love them correctly for the eyes first so get one more amazing song again amazing MV again an amazing comfort again they never disappoint honestly and I've listened to any album and it's sick too so they're yeah that was my reaction to send me huzza nizzy you woods and eyes one if five ever these with your favorites and I hope you're doing well Nick after yourselves and I will see you in my next I
