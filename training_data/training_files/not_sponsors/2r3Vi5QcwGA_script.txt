any creative business or tech subject you can think of as some of you may know I'm a white guy a white guy that talks about hip hop on the internet now I'm not the son of a banker from Manhattan who found out about hip hop through mo ba ba and Astroworld in fact I'm pretty far from it they used to call my hometown gun wave in New Haven but I still have to understand and know my place in the genre in order to keep my content genuine and respectful but I love Hip Hop I love the diverse instrumentation in production I love the songwriting storytelling and all the positivity that comes out of the genre there's no doubt in my mind that hip-hop will go down in history as an amazing once-in-a-lifetime cultural force and I want to make my mark on them but it's my responsibility to do it respectfully I went to shine light on what makes hip-hop an art form that can teach us about humanity in all its light and darkness but I try not to cross boundaries that aren't mine to cross you won't see me pretending that I know what it's like to grow up in Compton I'm not gonna make a video glorifying dealing drugs to get by that just wouldn't be genuine of me I feel that the best hip-hop is that which focuses on how we can be better versions of ourselves this is where Danny Brown comes in this 2016 album atrocity exhibition is for the most part downright gruesome it's like the musical equivalent of coming down from a coke bender so why would I want to analyze it to put it simply Danny's a storytelling is complex and profound he doesn't just depict drug use like a lot of a trendy you trap rappers do he pulls the listener into the dark painful reality of addiction and consumption subverting the listeners expectations with profound meditations on the culture that made him no glorification there instead the listener hears a very intense very real cautionary tale and for that he's one of the most talented musical storytellers I've ever come across let's get into it Danny's fourth and most recent album atrocity exhibition is often considered his most substantial and creative work to date it presents a culmination of many of the themes he's been tackling throughout his career his rapping and production reached a fever pitch of intensity but most importantly of all the story that atrocity exhibition tells is moving from the very delivery of Danny's rapping to the biting overwhelming production he proved his worth as a storyteller not just through songwriting because that's not the only important aspect of hip-hop storyteller the genre is a unique vehicle for delivering narrative through music despite being based around written word it can provide a far more powerful experience than written word on its own atrocity exhibitions true success is that it almost feels like a movie and the way Danny attacks from all sides delivering his message with a listening experience that's both eye-opening and deeply uncomfortable atrocity exhibition starts with something of a thesis statement the opening track downward spiral throws us into the middle of the story almost like a scene from an 80's coming-of-age movie but Denny isn't skipping school he's three days into a bender stuck inside his room suffering from drug-induced paranoia he buys some drugs grinds his teeth and tries to deal with the drug-induced erectile dysfunction throughout the song Danny goes back and forth between boasting and misery he burns his chest with Hennessy before bragging about how he's still the best rapper in the game the dissonant instrumental swirls around and around while Denny resolves to figure out what's making him so depressed the song's title downward spiral is actually a reference to a song from Danny's breakout album xxx that songs usage of the term is a reference to the title song on Nine Inch Nails classic 2004 record the downward spiral the Nine Inch Nails track is a famously disturbing look at suicide which as we'll see is a common theme and Danny's music one of the most heavily used storytelling devices throughout atrocity exhibition is the instrumentals Denny collaborated heavily with English producer Paul white who he's been working with since 2011 together they brought the album's themes alive with instrumentals that to my ears are downright grating and overwhelming the track gold dust barrage is the listener with a wall of dissonant synths and drums all going in different directions while pneumoniae Sables chains to simulate the overstimulation a drug user would experience while coming down from their high Danny doesn't glorify the topics he raps about one of the cornerstone characteristics of rap music has always been the glorification of addiction and consumption Danny Brown however cares more about expressing the hangover than the night before so I just think the most responsible way is just always telling both sides of the story you know this is rap music at the end of the day ain't no your grandma poster listen to so you could rap about whatever you want to rap about just make sure you tell the kids the other side you know if you're gonna tell them about getting high tell them about the hangover too you know and that's just one of the things that makes Danny so interesting someone once told me that you won't really understand Danny Brown until you've had a bad trip that might be a bit of an exaggeration but it gets the point across his music just isn't pleasant but that's what makes it so powerful and makes us rethink what we take for granted about rap culture and music in general possibly even leading us to introspection another theme that Danny tackles throughout the record is his youth in Detroit which as you may know is a city that's seen better days atrocity exhibitions the second track tell me what I don't know uses old-school synths and electric guitars to create a retro vibe then he talks about his past selling drugs and getting in trouble when he was a young adult the song is bleak it doesn't paint a nostalgic picture of Danny's past instead he shines a light on the tragedy he was surrounded by during as you the album ends with hell for a track that gives the listener their first moment of calm since the psychedelic downtempo downward spiral almost 40 minutes previous the piano melody is soft and ethereal while the drumbeat is barely audible at the start of the song it slowly builds up while Dani reflects on all that he's done with his life and the message of his music he talks about how he wants his troubled past to serve as a cautionary tale for those who hear him rap saying that he lived through it so those who come after him can avoid his mistakes and even further than that he's not going to let his addictions wash him down the drain without a fight the song helps atrocity exhibition end on a high note after an entire album of grimy storytelling frantic rapping and grating uniquely layered instrumentals all of that is to say Danny Brown is a master storyteller his narrative structures almost remind me of Aesop's fables ancient stories defined as short narratives that exemplify a moral or principle of human behavior where other rappers rarely get past expressing their most basic desires Danny faces these desires head-on and grapples with them everything about his music down to the very instrumentation in his beats supports his desire to communicate a moral message to the listener of course it's not exactly like a classical Aesop fable Danny rarely states the moral of the story in explicit terms instead the listening experience as a whole transmits its moral message to us through atmosphere instrumentation arrangement and lyrics the most important music is that which makes us think not that which entertains us and that's what makes Danny a timeless artist whose music will remain long after he's gone while we wait to hear the link in the description will get two months of unlimited access for free you
