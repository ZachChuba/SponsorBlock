[Music] this video is sponsored by creepypasta app for iPhone and Android will be in the description below when going on trips to interesting locations it's only natural to want to take a lot of pictures of the scenery to fully capture the moment sometimes wherever these pictures can contain strange things that seem unexplainable recently a fairly odd picture has posted the 4chan in the original poster actually reached out to me to look into what was up with the picture I found a pretty interesting so I decided to look into it this is what I found this picture was taken by a girl named Sophie last year her and her family were visiting a village called Vinci in Tuscany is the same village to Leonardo da Vinci grew up in now you're probably wondering what the big deal is this picture looks pretty normal and that's because it is so if we ended up accidentally taking two pictures within a second of each other this is a second picture as you can see this picture has what looks like a golden cloud or something of that sort in front of it honestly I have no idea what this was that appeared in the picture not only is the picture mysterious but some very odd stuff happened to Sophie not long after taking the picture she tried to upload the picture to read it but the picture refused to upload despite how many times she kept trying over the course of a week next start to upload at the 4chan on her first attempt it was rejected due to the child pornography policy which obviously doesn't make any sense when she finally did upload it to 4chan the fed was removed now for a month or so for seemingly no reason now that last detail about the 4chan being removed isn't actually all that strange since all threads do end up 404 eventually the rest of it is still weird though in addition she claims that her phone ended up getting stolen at a party so while she's waiting to get a new phone she brought her mother's old iPhone 4 oddly enough the picture with the golden cloud thing was in the iPhone 4 album somehow at the end of her email she swore she was talking to complete honest truth about everything but obviously I'm a bit skeptical of the whole situation obviously my first thought that this could have been edited with Photoshop or something of the sort so I took the picture to photo forensics comm to further analyze it as website pretty much help you decide whether or not a picture has been edited or not the first thing available on the site is error level analysis here's how this works here's a picture I took of my room which was not edited with error level analysis it looks like this now look at this picture which my obviously did edit by just adding a little line on it with the air level analysis it looks like this it is sort of highlights the areas where it may have been edited a better example would be this image where it clearly shows that the stacking rings have been edited in so I put both of Sophie's pictures into photo forensics and there wasn't any sign of it being edited with the air level analysis a pretty surprised because actually expected to find something with this I also looked at the metadata of the pictures just to confirm that everything she told me was accurate and it was both pictures really worth takin one second apart and they were taken with an iPhone 5 also the day and time these were taken match the time she told me as well right now the release in any indication that the picture was edited but there was one thing I found that was a little weird when looking at the metadata of the picture there's a tab labeled Photoshop which would imply the picture was run through Photoshop which was also suggests it was most likely edited in Photoshop I emailed Sophie about this and so once again swore God she did not hand worth any of the pictures it doesn't know why the photo shop tab appeared and I'm kind of starting to believe her a little bit because the Photoshop tab in the metadata appears on all the pictures you sent to me even the ones that she would have no reason to edit also when I run through one of the pictures that I Photoshop myself the Photoshop has all this information beneath it whereas the picture that Sophie sent me only at the IPTC digest underneath it I spent a long time analyzing these pictures trying to find out if any of them were edited and I couldn't find any really compelling proof that any of them were fake so I figured it was time to consider the possibility that this picture was real in the picture the cloud like object seems out of focus which led me to believe that whatever it was it was much closer to the camera than the other surroundings I considered that maybe her hair got in the way of the camera and this is what we're looking at asked her about this and sent me this picture of herself which confirms that she does have long blonde hair but she says it's unlikely it was her hair that got in the way because she was the camera far from her body when taking pictures somewhere to the person in this picture also the pictures were taken only one second apart so with a chance to ever hair moving in front of the camera that quickly or slim honestly I'm stumped at this point I couldn't find any strong evidence - this was edited and it seems unlikely that there was her hair the strange picture along with the even stranger story is really puzzling to me so she could be telling the truth which if that's the case I have no idea how to explain this or she could be lying either way I'm really puzzled as to what exactly happened here so what do you guys think well this real or just a hoax thank you for watching and I'll see you on the flipside [Music]
