and as you can see look at that and as soon as it saw one it was like hey they're everywhere so at two miles an hour I want to test out first is will it pick up spaces where there aren't any cars and you as you can clearly see it's not picking them up if I slow down and come to a stop no peas are appearing oh look like I actually said stop over there even though it doesn't say stop over there it was saying that it said stop now something that I have seen in this update is these disabled spaces are now recognized I mean granted they're not recognized very well and as soon as it saw what it was like they're everywhere but as you can see it's not letting me park into any of these so it's definitely not reading these even though it can see them as spaces it's not reading it as a space that I could drive into today I've got a brand new update 2020 28.1 has dropped and it brings with it absolutely no new features except one language update but that's not apparently what other people have been telling me I've read a lot that sometimes there are little improvements hidden within these updates and I got this comment from someone saying can you are can you test our auto park again because I'm pretty sure it's had an upgrade and it now works really well we're on the wrong side of the road here on Auto Parts you saw the auto park definitely favoring that right-hand side of the road there and was taking us over to the wrong side of the road but that's not we're here about we're here about Auto Park so we're coming to test it here we're gonna test parallel parking just like at normal adjacent parking all of that kind of good stuff and yeah let's just see how well the car does so I don't really know how to judge this I'm gonna go in between these two cars here and I'm gonna see if it wants to pick up any parking spaces and see what it will do so if I stop here and reverse has it no actually hasn't picked up any parking spaces even though there's clearly parking spaces here so that definitely is showing that it's not reading any of the lines it's only reading the placement of the cars because it would have known that obviously it can fit in this space pretty easily so it's definitely not updated that okay well that's good that we know that let's go test this then on an actual space where the car should be able to navigate us in here so for example this space on the right there should be enough space for us to go into that little spot there so let's give that a whirl yeah you can see that it says parking is available let's quick start and put a timer up in the corner and we'll see how long does this take now this is really nice because you can now see obviously what the mirrors themselves are seeing or the equivalent of the mirrors and we'll see how well it parks in between here it's a fairly fairly tight parking space I've got to say and we are on a hill as well so you will see that we are on a very very slight hill we've got a person in front of us here and he's going he's going in front I don't know if the car is gonna say it's gonna stop because of him or anything no it didn't seem to say anything about him but as you can see backing up nicely and pretty slowly still so I'm gonna say from this first test auto park works just as well so far which is great reversing us nicely and can you stop stop stop stop stop there we go sometimes it looks like it's not gonna stop that's perfect that has actually parked us perfectly here in the car nice and safe now what I'm gonna do is from my phone I'm actually going to use smart summon and I'm gonna try and summon the car out of this base oh look at that interesting so I can't summon because it says here great is too steep to use summon so this steepness is too much so if you had your car parked here and you wanted to summon it out go over there because you couldn't get in the side doors you can spaces like this where there are two spaces the car also will not park in so here we go we've got some angled spaces you can see these are kind of odd angles here loads of them not sure which one it wants to pick well I'm just gonna wait okay so it's picked one that one over there you can see it's at an angle to the car already and it is an angular Bay this is going to be quite tough for it to get into but hopefully it should be absolutely fine it definitely hasn't spread itself up so it's definitely slower than a human would do it and you can tell obviously it is being very very careful so I wouldn't say it's been upgraded yet but don't forget we haven't tested the parallel parking and that is the claimed upgrade apparently at parallel parked a lot better but perpendicular it is doing it really nicely it's keeping us nice and centered but I've got to say this is a lot lot longer than a human would take after this I'm gonna go and do this myself and I'll show you how quickly or just how normal speed I would do this this is where it's quite painful you can see how slowly we're coming back and if there was a guy there trying to go past us he would be banging his horn at me just going like why aren't you going it's very very slow but it is very very secure in very very safe okay brilliant so Auto Park complete now this time I'm gonna bring out my phone and we'll try it on this nan hill yeah okay so it now works smart summon I'm gonna summon my car out and we basically gonna go to the right and pass this van it is a one-way so no one's gonna be coming for that side but I will of course keep my eyes peeled and raring to go just in case so okay apparently not it says it's stopping wait let's try that again go to target so we've got a car on our left no one else coming gonna give that a whirl are we all good yet so it's coming out and you can see it's still driving itself at this point it's coming it's stopping so now it needs to reverse back is he gonna do it no it's still go forward yeah there we go it's reversing out so imagine if this was a really really tough space and you couldn't you couldn't get to your door anything there you go that actually did really really well I'm actually thoroughly surprised it's gonna slam on and stop in a second but I was thoroughly surprised with how well that did someone is stopping maybe going to be improved at all because I've got to say that was that was quite good it brought us out really nicely parallel parking in the UK is pretty popular as you can see everyone pretty much parks on the road down kind of residential areas where people live or just where parking is tight so let's give it a go we're gonna try and park ourselves into one of these parallel spaces and just see if it works we've got a huge space here on the right and that is the space that I want to take so I'm gonna go slow I'm gonna reverse up into it I'm just gonna show you here how quickly like a human would would would parallel park into a space like this and jobs are good and that's pretty much it I don't know how that took but there's nothing else is needed that is perfect parking let's go see how long the car would take I'm having real troubles getting the car to find out any parallel parking spaces what about that one there on the left as I pick that up yes okay so it's pick that one up there so maybe yeah so this is a really really small parking space that it's chosen so mainly all of the other spaces I was picking for it are just way too big we're going to test that space out after this one in a second but just so you know for example I wouldn't have picked this space myself because it is tight and it is very very tight so I'm intrigued to see how well the car does it that's doing pretty nicely it's getting really nice and close that's closer than it used to get which is good to see all the way left hand down pulling it in nicely so on these tighter spaces where yes they will take a little bit more time to actually work and get into that space cuz it's a finite space that you're trying to get into the auto part system is brilliant for it because I honestly wouldn't have tried to get into this space just because there's bigger spaces but it's really nice to know that the car itself can do that it took a lot longer it was a lot of a tight it was a lot tighter space that was really good potentially there's been an update then in parallel parking just maybe not in the how it finds the parallel parking spaces because currently it's not finding any so here for example I want the space on the right you can see this massive space here that is where I want the car to park will it do it will it show it for us no so you look no parking spaces at all but I bet you it will show that second one oh no actually you didn't even show the second one to be totally fair so just after this sign on the left I want to park basically between this fear and the road so I just want to park here on the left and I'm gonna see if we drive past it will the car know that there's lines there it definitely knows there's lines there will it show us that it can park in that space behind the fear or will it just go straight past it no as you can see oh actually actually I am wrong it sees a parking space but wait what is it seeing as a parking space no way actually just sees that as the space sorry I can't do that because that's not and it was trying to parallel park right there all I'm waiting for is parking spaces to appear on the screen here you go look at this so you can see what I was talking about it actually thinks it for disabled spaces are that the pot the toddler spaces but they're obviously not however it just sees the the drawing on the ground and it just thinks that okay that must be a disabled person but weirdly when it actually showed the disabled person logo it didn't bother showing it on the floor kind of strange so far as well we've not that's not found any car parking spaces that the car actually wants to park into and we're gonna have to do another laugh I think here of the car park so yeah again so far it's just because the car isn't actually reading any of the lines it's not picking up anything except for exact spaces so again still we've gone through loads of spaces there but no peas are coming up at all so it's not wanting to park in any of these spaces again even though there's no cars here it wouldn't Park any spaces it will auto park though at Auto Drive I'll go all the way down to zero now it never used to go down to zero so I think that's new I'm going to auto drive this corner at two miles an hour I know this isn't to do with the video but you know that I like to do some wacky things so at two miles an hour it just full-on aborted it it didn't even attempt to turn it like saw the turn it was like yeah no I'm definitely not gonna get that all right so there's spaces here on the left that the car has to be able to pick up there's absolutely tons of them and if it doesn't pick any of these up this is gonna be an absolutely huge fail okay there we go picking one up you can also see that it saw the lady from this far away all the way down all the way down the roads but let's see again how well it does this no problems at all here again this isn't gonna be as quick as as humans doing it as we can see but because luckily there's no one around us we've actually got no problems taking our time and that is what it does I'm also very surprised that it always comes back and then it always has to go forward I'm amazed it hasn't figured out to do it in one but you can see how slowly it still wants to do it and I think every single one of these is 30 seconds to a minute long easily oh wow this is slow it's brilliant it's awesome tech and it's doing it perfectly but gosh does it do it slowly yeah so oh and is it going over the line or just no no it's actually stopped just at the line which is good so not bad you know it did it I'm definitely gonna say there wasn't an improvement in this update because you can tell that it's not quicker what I was really hoping was at least like a 50% improvement to speed okay this could be a perfect space here on the left I actually once you get my car into that space there on the left it is on the road so this is going to be a tough parking for it to do but it is a parallel park it is doing it all by itself let's give it a whirl I've put the indicator on you can turn it off but I'm just leaving it on and this really needs to be able to do it in one for this to be kind of valuable and actually usable on the road and as you can see look at that parallel parking really nicely that's way better than I would do it and roughly actually about the same speed I'm not gonna lie I am thoroughly impressed with how that parallel part so perpendicular parking seems very slow and pretty sucky it won't park at a diagonal trust me it won't do it at all parallel though look at that did it really well didn't annoy anyone that's not half bad in conclusion has there been an upgrade has there been an update to auto parking no there definitely hasn't don't get me wrong parallel parking does seem a little bit better and I was kind of happy to see that it was a little bit quicker but it still wasn't perfect and it still needed some updating in conclusion then I don't in conclusion there's been no update to water park that I could notice parallel parking was a little bit quicker when we were able to test it but actually getting it to be able to do it seemed to be a bigger issue than I thought let me know what you think down below in the comment section and also let me know anything else you want me to test with the model 3 and all of its tech here on Ted's the driver thank you all so much for watching and again a huge shout out to all our patrons we've now
