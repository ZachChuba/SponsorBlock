hey there and welcome to another video this week it's just a short little in-between video as I got a bigger project coming in next week today we're taking a look at a hard drive that I left on a roof for five years yes there's no exaggeration there actually left this hard drive on a roof for five years back in 2015 I got a large lot of computers and laptops from a business that was closing down one of those hard disks didn't work so I thought I'd just put it on a roof to see what happens anyway it's been sitting out there for five years in the pelting rain scorching Sun and everything in between it didn't actually work when I put it up there so it definitely doesn't work now anyway let's see exactly what happened to that hard disk the 2.5 inch hard disk we have here has a capacity of 160 gigabytes the label on the front is still legible but it's clearly starting to fade away the other side not exposed to the Sun has a fair amount of rust around the Phillips head screws there is definitely a lot of corrosion which isn't too surprising given where it's been stored for the last five years but one annoying thing is all the screws holding a PCB on our rusted tight I slightly stripped the first screw by accident I thought applying a small amount of wd-40 lubricant would help maybe get the screws turning even with it applied the screws simply wouldn't budge I also tried scrubbing the rust affected areas with isopropyl alcohol which I guess kind of unsurprisingly had very little effect I let the drive sit for about five minutes before I tried again which didn't help at all and still that the screws would not turn I'll try it drilling the PCB off later in the video to get into the hard disk itself I applied some wd-40 before carefully unscrewing the stalks t5 screws using a plastic spudger I carefully pried the cover off I didn't realize there was a hidden screw underneath the label inside the drive we can see that things don't look too good at first I thought I had to remove this Torx t6 screw on the back but nope it turns out there was a hidden screw here all along that doesn't look too flash at all now that we've got it opened up we can see that the drive has indeed been compromised by water I'm not exactly sure how it made its way in I thought hard drives were air tired but either way water has got in for those of you that don't know in these old mechanical hard drives as the drive platters spin at 5,400 revolutions per minute the little drive head moves back and forth to read and write your data since I'd like to see how corroded the circuit board is and given the fact that the screws are now stripped I'm going to have to step things up a notch the first drill what I use seemed a little bit too blunt I stood there and drilled for literally minutes with not a lot happening time for a bigger drill bit now this seemed to work a lot faster with the second screw I ended up obliterating the surrounding circuit board next I tried to drill out the screws that were holding the PCB in place and I definitely broke the board while doing this since the drive was already dead even before it sat out there for five years it's not like we were going to fix it anyway so I used some force and pried the board off it really doesn't look as bad as I thought it wouldn't in fact most of it's just dirt although I definitely broke the board not that the hard disk worked anyway even though solid state storage is everywhere now mechanical hard disks still have very useful applications with the drive open once again let's completely disassemble it the first part to come off is one side of the strong magnet when electricity is sent through the copper coils on the drive head it will move in a very specific way the clicking sound you often hear in old hard disks is the heads hitting against the casing all of your precious data is stored on these magnetic platters this particular drive has two of them a lot of moisture and water has definitely gotten in here if this drive was spinning all of that water would be flung off the platters a small metal ring separates the platters if you don't have money for an engagement ring I guess this would do underneath we've got many years worth of liquid that pulled inside the drive you wouldn't want to touch this motor when it's spinning at full speed if you're in desperate need for a mirror a drive platter would work quite well so should you leave your hard disk outside on the roof for five years the answer unsurprisingly is no although it wasn't as damaged as I thought it would be I was surprised that water had actually compromised the drive and gotten inside next to the subscribe button below anyway as always thank you very much for watching if you've liked the video feel free to leave a like and if you want to see more definitely consider subscribing I hope you're going to enjoy the video we've got coming up next week because it's about a really really really old computer anyway I'll see you then you
