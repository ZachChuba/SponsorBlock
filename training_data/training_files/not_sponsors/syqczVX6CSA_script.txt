they who akin to god's name surely ken to the terrors of the dark please i bid thee take not from the princess her peace or rest as the fire waneth does she lie by the dark all for the sake of man hey there and i hope you're well i'm jake the ash and hollow and in this video i'll be doing a social experiment of sorts well a social experiment on just myself i mean i'm not experimenting on myself i just want to find out if i can actually back the stance of gwyn did nothing wrong icon for notifications and follow me on twitter for reasons the mighty gwyn the lord of sunlight seen by many as the harbinger of sin as the manipulative king who would go to any lengths to extend his legacy but was it also black and white or was what gwen did necessary not just for his kind but for the humans as well before the advent of fire there was no life the ones who would go on to find the lord's souls and populate the world were simply hollowed humanoid beings not unlike what we know of hollows now so the undead curse is a manifestation of dark the narrator at the beginning of dark souls 1 says but soon the flames will fade and only dark will remain even now there are only embers and man sees not light but only endless nights and amongst the living are seen carriers of the accursed dark sign the fading of the light is darkness manifest and it triggers the undead curse so at the peak of the age of fire the curse of undeath doesn't occur because light dominates the land sure the advent of fire and the disparity it created could have been the reason that the curse would ever go on to exist in the first place but that certainly isn't gwen's fault linking the fire however was but what did it do it restored the light and kept dark from manifesting at least for a while anyway so it didn't cure the undead curse but it certainly staved it off until the flames began fading again and dark came creeping back so in gwynn we have a man or god who shouldered the weight of the world's problems and was poised to solve them all himself people often think of gwen as manipulative or untrustworthy but it was gwyn who constantly spread the wealth of his lord's soul to those who pledged to help preserve life from the dark they came and found the souls of lords within the flame the dark's return was only a symbol of lifeless hollowing of course the world would prefer to not reinvite that meaningless existence yet gwyn does not squander his wealth and power and a selfish fear to face the dark himself he divides it amongst his friends and allies so that they together can keep the world safe from dark so the fire begins to fade and soon only dark will remain and the humans are the first to feel its effects as the dark side begins marking them with the curse of undeath gwyn watches as his people suffer and fear and watch his humanity start at slow descent into agonizing madness and he knows it falls upon him to end the plight of his kingdom but he isn't completely swinging blind here he knows the answer is within the flame he'd already even used it against the abyss the ring night armor reads malformed black armor of the ringed knights the armor of early men was forged in the abyss and betrays a smidgen of life for this reason the gods cast a seal of fire upon such armor and those who possessed them the light drowns out the dark prevents its spread and halts its power the answer as gwen would come to learn was reigniting the first flame only then would the light be powerful enough to drive back the dark but it wasn't that simple in theory there were those who preached against the flame those who would rather bask in dark in hopes that it would achieve them their full potential even the primordial serpent coth searched endlessly for the one dark lord to usher in this age of dark from those do we hear the tales of gwyn's deception and lies but are they not their own lies to their own ends even gwyn knew the horrors that the dark inflicted upon humanity itself a literal curse but yet some yearned for this dark even still in fact the whole light and dark conundrum could be viewed as quite synonymous to what's going on in the real world today those who were vile gwyn's age of fire believed that by preventing the dark from consuming the world that we're fighting against nature against the natural order of things but i'd wager we can compare linking the fire to prevent this dark to our modern day science even right now in the world as it's bogged down in the complications with the covet 19 virus we have those who don't even believe it exists science deniers and conspiracy theorists if we left the world alone to never intervene with nature then viruses and natural disasters would threaten our very existence more so than they already do yet we fight against it with modern technology and science even against the naysayers with their anti-vaccine climate-denying flat earther theories again to me seems a bit synonymous to the situation lord gwyn had on his hands to alter the course of nature even if it was within everyone's best interest you'd be branded a liar and hated by those who disagree gwen was constantly making hard sacrifices to secure the future for the population of the world splitting his own power even giving his own daughter away for the sake of mankind those most susceptible to the dark we can't say for sure why princess philianor sleeps whether it's to help conceal the ringed city and thus the dark soul from the world keeping essentially a nuclear bomb out of the hands of the enemies of life or if her slumber is what alters time itself and all divergent pockets of time convalesce upon her demise but her slumber is an extremely extensive topic for another video time and again gwen put the world before not only himself but his own family as well his youngest pledged to lie in wait at the ringed city and fall deep into her slumber as the fire began to fade and dark began to seep into the world all for the sake of humanity his oldest thrown out for allying himself with their enemy that threatened their way of life you could call gwyn many things but selfish and power hungry don't quite hit the mark on top of all that gwen would then go on to make the ultimate sacrifice by providing his own body and soul to be used as the kindling that would re-light the first flame and bring light back into a world being consumed by the horrors of the dark to spare humanity from the undead curse for that much longer to let life prosper once again away from the precipice of impending darkness [Music]
