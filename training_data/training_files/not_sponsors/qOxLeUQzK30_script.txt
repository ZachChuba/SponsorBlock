everyone Tesla Tom here thanks for joining us on ludicrous speed we're just doing a little night drive tonight on our Tesla Model 3 performance on software version twenty twenty point four point eleven point one it's an important update because it's got the four self-driving visualizations as you can see right there ahead of you on the screen there we've got traffic lights we've got people crossing the street I'm gonna try a bit of auto pilot as well as we drive into Chatswood I'm not going to use a full navigate on autopilot just the basic autopilot and that should be interesting enough as it is difference being that basic autopilot which is double tap on the indicator two blue lines there and it's just auto steer and lane keeping and keeping to the speed limit and following the car ahead of you but slower than the speed limit it's supposed to navigate an autopilot which is a single blue line and that's just trying to get you to the destination making lane change decisions those kind of things alright so we're just driving into Chatsworth now it's a bit more urban of an area that in Sydney might built up so I get to see a bit more visualizations now with basic autopilot it's important that it doesn't react to traffic lights just yet I know the car stopped there but that's because there was a car ahead of me but had I been the first car at a traffic light that would been quite dangerous and certainly not recommended for basic autopilot and even for navigate an autopilot at this stage in Australia that was quite dangerous there wasn't it it sort of deviated a bit there so that's why you should always pay attention at the road lost some markings there and the classwork to the left that's okay I had full attention and full control definitely all right so back to visualizations there we go I've got some lines there I've got some lane markings got traffic lights and again the car has stopped ahead of me there's a car ahead of me there but like I said had I been the first line at that mr. section line if the car wouldn't have stopped but hopefully with the next update like they have an American now just released announced that this car can match and reengage as I'm saying once we get the update update like they have in America the car will start to react to traffic lights stop signs which are we good to test as well all right so that that car was going but slower than the speed limit hits I was slow as well I'm not going to the speed limit that's traffic aware cruise control so get it make a left pretty soon into Chatswin itself right but indicate left now probably gonna disengage autopilot just for a second okay no I don't have to do that just yet as a car comes to the stop I will shortly if I don't do it now once the car stops see that said auto lane change unavailable because someone basic autopilot few chocolate lights there there's that intersection line ahead of me once we get that next update hopefully we'll be able to see the car reacting to traffic lights and I assume the car will try to stop at that intersection line there so the car is always in something called shadow mode which is Tesla trying to predict what what it would do in a situation and then compare it to the human reaction like my reaction basically and I guess all this data is very important for the neural net one day when all self-driving that's true for self-driving is activated then Tesla has got some data to show regulators and governments that look you know where 99 plus percent accurate that should help turn on autonomous driving if you guys can see that on the screen there a bit more contrast in dark mode just driving into Chatswood proper [Music] but engage what a pilot see how well it goes in urban areas okay see this car is going really quickly up to the red light I'm gonna disengage because there's no able to stopped in time I said if you're the first kind of light definitely best to disengage autopilot but from here I wonder whether you can engage on a pilot oh I'm gonna keep going a little bit so you're gonna start a little bit before you engage all the power until they're gray there we go so I'll probably be doing a lot of engaging disengaging autopilot that's my drive around Chatswood for you that's why I generally don't have it on during doing urban areas just because it's it's not not true self driving you've got to take control and a lot of areas where the lane markings may not be present or intersections where how it might be confused yeah when it's been right okay so we'll just stop here at the meantime it's a little bit scary that okay but went away I was going to say that the autopilot song was still long there certainly wouldn't be engaging at a red light if I was turning right for example that should be our turn to turn pretty soon right disengage pretty quickly cuz the red lights there so I think I think so I made a comment why I don't use for self-driving in urban area as well this is exactly the reason just because the current update it's just not appropriate I think so I'll do a little bit more but you know quite clearly see it's just not um not much fun turning it on and off all the time but now an aim of this video is to show you some of the visualizations in dark mode and flee get some idea of what what to expect okay so what we'll do is we'll go bit further up up to Pacific Highway and then we'll duck back in on the other side so you can see the main drag chance would be more more visualizations in that built-up area so you can see it's pretty responsive right the light turned green and then the light here turned green pretty quickly as well [Music] [Music] okay so just heading up to the Pacific Highway Junction I'm not gonna go all the way in there if I can I'm gonna turn right in that Lane way that should sneak us around to the other side Chatswood Albert Lane yes see how well I know my Chatswood so far so good sure the back roads here now I think it's a right turn on Thomas Street cook you're on your left here it is a writer okay Oh without navigation guys just old school what they call in London the way the knowledge something like that isn't it the old cabbies used to know London very well okay you know it doesn't pick up pedestrian crossings so I think that's something that could be worked off the next update here in railway station rubbish bins traffic lights very high pedestrian area normally so guess when the new update comes will come when that's busier I'll see how safe the car is without reacting to things gesturing aware it's very important more cones am i right okay let's turn right here ya see again there's that stop sign in the traffic light you'll see your head there it's actually a combined stop sign on traffic light so yeah this is a very unique Sydney thing maybe even Australian thing get from another city let me know that also occurs in Melbourne or Brisbane or any other city or town in Australia and then as you can see there there's a four lit for like traffic lights so that's not showing up here either okay that's a unique thing here made that lights good sneak into shouts would see we can just sneak in autopilot just before the light there [Music] [Music] okay so what we'll do is we'll drive on here and then we're going to that might engage on a partner so you can engage it at stop obviously I'm not the first car at the light so it's okay and then as you can see when the car moves actually reacts pretty well it's a bit dubious many many lane markings there that's what it gets a little bit confused but it's try its best it's trying its best there we go is it gonna go yes it's gonna go well done car all done this is what it's confused again I might check over pretty soon it's gonna get pretty confused all right yes you see the pedestrian walk across my current screen obviously that didn't happen fare down okay so means that's picking up stationery bins - like this one here you go that shows up is that we live in pretty cool because I mean you know how does the kind of that's a bit I mean what if it's a funny-looking bin I'm impressed okay and then what we'll do is we'll swing back left go back up Archer Street now this pedestrian crossing here ahead of me is a four-way crossing so it's not showing up as I mean the pedestrian crossings not showing up currently and there were the you see on the camera but that that four-way crossings got a timer as well so that'd be cool if we can see that as well with future updates like that the timer counting down for the pedestrian crossing looking at lots of restaurants again picking up another bin there that station again must be now gone with them right it kind of looks like a bean it's a cyclist up there and that basically ladies and gentlemen is Chatswood at 5:30 at twilight guys stay safe look after yourselves take care I'll see you next time
